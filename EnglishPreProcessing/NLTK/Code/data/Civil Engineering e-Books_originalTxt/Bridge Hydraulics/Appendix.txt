Hydrodynamic forces on bridges

A1 Hydrodynamic forces on piers

These are the drag force (F D kN) in the direction of flow and the lift force (F L kN)
perpendicular to it. According to Apelt and Isaacs (1968):

Page 344

(A1)

(A2)

where C D and CL are the dimensionless coefficients of drag and lift respectively, ρis the
density of the water (kg/m3), V is the approach flow velocity (m/s), Y is the depth upstream of
the pier (m), and L is either the length of the pier in the direction of flow or the diameter of a
single cylindrical pier (m).
The hydrodynamic forces on piers are usually small (e.g. compared with ship impact),
which is often convenient because CD and CL depend upon factors such as the shape and
spacing of the piers, the angle of attack, and the Reynolds number of the flow (Apelt and
Isaacs, 1968; Farraday and Charlton, 1983). Note that (unlike coefficients of discharge) CD
and CL can have values above 1.0. Very approximately, CD values around 0.2–0.5 may be
typical for some pier shapes pointing into the flow, but rise with the angle of attack to
somewhere around 1.0–2.0. Since equations A1 and A2 are the same apart from the
coefficients, a blunt pier, which would be expected to experience a larger drag than lift force,
would have a highe r CD value than C L, and vice versa for aerofoil shapes.

A2 Hydrodynamic force on submerged superstructures

Hydraulic Engineering Circular 20 of the US Federal Highways Authority (FHWA, 1991)
gave the drag force per metre length (FD kN/m) of a submerged o r partially submerged bridge
deck as

(A3)

Page 345

where C d is the dimensionless coefficient of drag, which has a suggested value of between 2.0
and 2.2, H is the depth of submergence (m), and the other variables are as above.

A3 Ice forces

Neill (1973) suggested that piers with semicircular noses in plan and slightly inclined inwards
to the vertical (Fig. 1.15) are effective in discouraging ice accumulations. The worst -case
scenario may be large sheets of hard ice hitting the piers. Unfortunately the forces generated
depend upon the type and strength of the ice, and how the ice fails (e.g. crushing, splitting,
shearing, bending). Farraday and Charlton (1983), the American Association of State and
Transport Officials (AASHTO , 1993) and the UK’s Highways Agency (1994) presented an
equation for the horizontal force (F H kN) on a pier having ‘substantial mass and dimensions’:

adjacent to the pier up to a maximum of 21 m. The following equation gives the force (F kN)
due to trapped debris of area A (m 2) being hit by a flow with an approach velocity, V m/s:

Some alternative equations for local scour

See Jones (1984), Melville (1988) and Richardson et al. (1993) for further details.

B1 Pier scour

All equations have to be used with the appropriate adjustment factors to allow for pier shape
and orientation to the flow. The equations below are for square-nosed piers.
The Laursen—Toch equation is
live-bed scour

Page 348

(8.14)

For the CSU equation it is assumed the bed is plane (K3P=1.1).

B2 Abutment scour

All equations have to be used with the appropriate adjustment factors to allow for abutment
shape and orientation to the flow. These equations tend to assume that there is no overbank
flow, so that abutment or embankment length is measured from the side of the main channel.
The following simplified Laursen equation will be very conservative for wingwall and
spillthrough abutments:
live-bed scour

clear -water scour

(B4)

(B5)

where dSA is the abutment scour depth (m), Y is the depth of the approach flow (m), and L is
the length by which the abutment protrudes into the main channel measured perpendicularly
to the bank.
For live-bed scour at spillthrough abutments the equation attributed to Liu et al. (1961) is
