How to analyse flow past piers and trestles

5.1 Introduction

Unlike the previous chapter, which dealt with channel constrictions where the abutments
formed the primary obstacle to flow and the piers were the secondary consideration, this
chapter deals with situations where the piers themselves cause the primary obstruction, while
the secondary effect of the abutments is negligible. This may happen either with short bridges
where the abutments are not in the flow (just the piers) or when the the bridge is long with a
large number of piers in the watercourse. Although the latter may be uncommon in Britain,
where rivers and floodplains are relatively small, in some countries the floodplains of large
rivers can be several miles across and bridges may have well over 100 spans. Under these
conditions it is easy to see how the piers, rather than the abutments, become the primary
factor in the hydraulic analysis of the bridge.
The obstruction of bridge piers to the flow of water has been studied for over 150 years.
One of the earliest investigations was by d’Aubuisson (1840), followed by Nagler (1918) and
Yarnell (1934a). A typical approach is to use a long, laboratory channel in which the flow is
initially uniform. By introducing one or more equally spaced piers to the central part of the
channel their effect on the flow can be measured. If the uniform flow is supercritical the result
will be to split the flow, causing a disturbed wake downstream and spray upstream. The
amount of spray depends upon the shape of the piers. There is no other effect upstream, since
a characteristic of supercritical flow is that disturbances do not propagate upstream. However,
the more usual scenario is that the flow will be initially subcritical. As described in Section
2.2, a backwater occurs upstream, increasing the depth at section 1, while the depth between
the piers decreases to a minimum at section 3 as the flow accelerates ( Fig. 5.1). At section 4,
well downstream of the bridge, the flow is again at normal depth. Between sections 3 and 4
there is a region of turbulence due to the wake created by the piers and the expanding flow.
It is as a result of Yarnell’s work that there are fairly reliable coefficients to use with the
d’Aubuisson and Nagler equations, and that there is some understanding of which equation is
the most suitable under various circumstan ces. Consequently it is advisable to read all of
Sections 5.2–5.4 rather

pier shapes. He derived his own equation for the discharge (Q) between the piers. This
derivation is rarely presented in full, perhaps because the original paper is not always clear in
its meaning . However, the basis is simply to consider the flow

when the flow is shooting and turbulent. The value of βvaries with the opening ratio (M), as
shown in Fig. 5.3. Example 5.1 provides an illustration of the application of the equation.
The Nagler equation is rath er more complicated than d’Aubuisson’s but, because there is
some allowance for the recovery of head downstream of section 3 and it is not assumed that
Y3=Y4 , it is more accurate under conditions of low turbulence. Like the d’Aubuisson equation
it is not very accurate at high velocities.

5.4 The work of Yarnell

5.4.1 Flow between bridge piers

Between 1927 and 1931 Yarnell conducted about 2600 experiments on the obstructive effects
of bridge piers to the flow of water. He used larger piers and a more extensive range of
conditions than previous investigators. The opening ratios adopted were between 0.88 and
0.50, quite severe by modern standards, but the results can still be applied to more slender
piers. Yarnell published his results in 1934, and listed the following as affecting the amount of
obstruction caused by a bridge pier, and hence the resulting af flux:
• the shape of the pier nose;
• the shape of the pier tail;
• the channel contraction caused by the pier;
• the length of the pier;
• the angle between the longitudinal centreline of the pier and the approaching stream of water
(the angle of attack, ø, in Table 5.1);
• the quantity of flow.
Yarnell’s aim was to evaluate these factors by investigating the flow past piers of different
shape and length to width ratio. He also determined the values of the coefficients (K) in the
d’Aubuisson and Nagler equations (as shown in Table 5.1 ) and investigated the accuracy of
the equations. Yarnell made the following observations.
• The d’Aubuisson and Nagler equations are not accurate at high velocities, but for ordinary
velocities the coefficients in Table 5.1 are generally satisfactory.
• For low-velocity flows and little turbulence, piers with lens -shaped noses and tails, semi-
circular noses and tails, or some combination of these, are the more efficient. Twin-cylinder
piers (with or without connecting diaphragms), piers with 90° noses, and piers with
recessed webs are less efficient, while piers with square noses and tails are the least
hydraulically efficient. A lens -shaped nose or tail is formed from two convex curves that
are tangent to the sides of the pier and which have a radius twice the width of the pier.
• The optimum pier length-to-width ratio is probably between 4 and 7 depending upon
velocity. Typically increasing the ratio from 4 to 13 will increase the values in Table 5.1 by
3–5%, but this is not guaranteed.
• There is little difference between similar piers that are parallel to the approaching flow and
at an angle of less than 10°, but if the angle of attack (φ) is 20° then typically the values in
Table 5.1 will decrease by 7%. Over 20° the afflux increases significantly, the actual
increase depending upon the flow rate and depth, and the severity of the obstruction.

Two basic flow types were identified: class A or subcritical flow, and class B or supercritical
flow. Yarnell used equation 3.13 to determine the limiting condition at which the flow
becomes choked and supercritical flow may commence. With subcritical conditions the afflux

(after Yarnell, 1934a). For example, assume M=0.865,
V4=2.41 m/s,
and piers with semicircular noses and
tails. Enter the left-hand chart at M =0.865, move horizontally to V4=2.41 m/s, then
vertically down to read x=0.04 m. Enter the right-hand chart with

Figure 5.4 for subcritical flow was originally presented by Yarnell (1934a) in English units,
but has been redrawn for this book in metric units. For simplicity, the metrication of the
diagram assumes that 1 foot=0.30m. Several of the terms are dimensionless and do not need
conversion; the variable x was defined by Yarnell as

Page 184

Fig. 5.5 Chart for determining the afflux caused by supe rcritical flow past bridge piers (after Yarnell,
1934a). As explained in the text, F4L is the normal depth Froude number at the limiting
contraction when the flow in the opening is at critical depth (F3=1).

An illustration of this procedure is given in Fig. 5.4 and Example 5.2. Note that if the afflux is
already known and the discharge (Q=A4V4) has to be obtained using Fig. 5.4 it will be
necessary to guess a value of V 4 and then keep repeating the steps listed above until the value
of
obtained from the chart equals that which was observed. When this happens V4 is
correct and Q can be calculated. Naturally the generalised charts cannot be very accurate
when applied to specific situations.
Figure 5.5 was also presented by Yarnell and redrawn, but has not needed to be metricated.
To use it, knowing Y4, start by calculating the actual value of F4 and M. Then with the actual
value of M as ML, the limiting downstream condition (F4L) at which the flow between the
piers will be at critical

depth can be obtained from equation 3.14 or Fig 3.5. By entering the bottom scale of Fig. 5.5
at the appropriate value of F4/F4L, moving vertically up to the line representing the pier shape,
and then horizontally across to the left scale, the value of
can be obtained. Thus the
afflux

small amount of channel contraction, the question as to whether the pile trestle coefficient is
the same for different bridge opening ratios does not arise. Consequently the coefficients
presented in Table 5.3 can be used for subcritical flow (but not supercritical) without
correction for the opening ratio.
Other conclusions reached by Yarnell were as follows.
• In general, the d’Aubuisson and Nagler equations could be applied ‘very favourably’ to
most of the conditions encountered in the experiments concerning trestles.
• Until the angle of attack exceeds 10° there is little decrease in the coefficient, and hence in
the discharge.
• With an angle of attack of 30° the discharge coefficient for trestle bents is about 4% less
than for bents aligned with the current, while the backwater will be increased by 50–70%
for a single-track crossing.
• Some beneficial effect can be obtained by setting trestle bents in echelon if a roadway
crosses the river at an angle.
• A double -track trestle with the bents offset offers a somewhat greater obstruction than a
double-track trestle with the piles in line.
• All of the above may be unreliable if the velocity and depth of flow met in practice are much
greater than used in the model tests.

5.5 Examples

Example 5.1

A rectangular river channe l 107m wide is completely spanned by a bridge that has six equally
spaced piers (but no abutments) in the watercourse. Each of the piers is 2.40m wide and has a
semicircular nose and tail.

During a flood it was observed that the afflux
was 0.09m when averaged across the six
piers. The average normal depth of flow downstream of the crossing (Y4=YN) was 2.44m.
Estimate the discharge using the d’Aubuisson and Nagler equations.

Page 187

Note that the d’Aubuisson and Nagler equations must be solved by trial and error because
the velocities V1 and V4 are initially unknown when the discharge is unknown. However, to
shorten this example, assume that V1= 2.34 m/s and V4=2.41 m/s.

Example 5.2

Using the same data as in Example 5.1 and assuming that the discharge is 630.5 m3/s but the
afflux
is unknown, determine its value when the piers have (a) semicircular noses and
tails, and (b) square noses and tails.
From Example 5.1, V4=2.41 m/s and Y4 =2.44 m.
Thus F 4=V 4/(gY4)1/2=2.41/(9.81×2.44)1/2=0.493 and so
a=(1−M)=0.135 (or alternatively, a =6×2.40/107= 0.135).

flow:

The same answer can be obtained from Fig. 5.4. The caption to the diagram relates to part
(a) of this example. (Note that in Example 5.1 the initial value of

equations yield different answers.)
(b) For piers with square noses and tails Table 5.2 shows K=1.25, so equation 5.11
becomes
