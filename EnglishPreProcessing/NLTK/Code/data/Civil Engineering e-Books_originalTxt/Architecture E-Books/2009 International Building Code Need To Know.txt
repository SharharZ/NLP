Preface

This book is your guide to getting your code questions answered with less
stress. It is your ticket to simplifying the cryptic code that you work with on
a daily basis. The code is large and can be complicated. I’ve translated the
code into easy-to-use terms for people in the field. See the code as a real-
world guide instead of some foreign language that only some people can
begin to sift through. This is your chance.

How important is understanding the code? It is essential for professionals
in the trade. Building without code compliance is an expensive mistake.
Many good builders and contractors mean well and still stray from the
code. This is often due to the code being difficult to understand and follow.
Not anymore. This book will walk you through the code requirements
chapter by chapter.

Laid out in the same basic sequence as the code book, this book can be used
in conjunction with your code book. While this book is not a replacement
for your code book, it is a strong enhancement to it. Use the books together
as resources to make your job or your business more productive.

Thumb through the pages here. Notice the tip boxes. You will find that
some key components of the code are highlighted in the tip boxes. Go
ahead, take a peek. While you are at it, pick a few topics that you are either
familiar with or confused about, and look them up. See for yourself how
easy this book makes it to put your mind at ease on code issues.

You might find another book that attempts to do what this one does, but if
you are looking for one guide to the code that you can trust, this is it.

CHAPTER

1

Use and Occupancy Classifications

Structures or portions of structures need to be classified in regards to the
occupancy of one or more groups. A room or space that is intended to be
occupied at different times for different purposes must comply with all of
the requirements that are applicable to each of those purposes. These
structures that you have identified as having multiple uses, or occupancies,
must comply with the code book. You may have questions about a struc-
ture that is proposed for a purpose that is not found in the code book. In
this event, each structure must be classified in the group that the occu-
pancy most nearly resembles, according to the fire safety and hazard in-
volved. The 2009 International Code Book lists ten categories or groups
that a structure or portion of a structure must be classified as. You will find
clarification on these classifications as we go through this chapter.

䡲 Assembly: Groups A-1, A-2, A-3, A-4, and A-5

䡲 Business: Group B

䡲 Educational: Group E

䡲 Factory and Industrial: Groups F-1 and F-2

1

2

CHAPTER 1

䡲 High Hazard: Groups H-1, H-2, H-3, H-4, and H-5

䡲 Institutional: Groups I-1, I-2, I-3, and I-4

䡲 Mercantile: Group M

䡲 Residential: Groups R-1, R-2, R-3, and R-4

䡲 Storage: Groups S-1 and S-2

䡲 Utility and Miscellaneous: Group U.

Group A occupancy includes, among other things, using a building or
structure or even a portion of building or structure for purposes such as a
civic, social, or religious functions; recreation, the consumption of food or
drink; or for those waiting for transportation, such as a bus or taxi. There
are exceptions in the classification of Assembly Group A:

䡲 A building used for assembly purposes that has occupancy of
less than 50 persons must be classified as Group B occupancy.
䡲 A room or space used for assembly purposes that is less than
750 square feet in area and is also accessible to another occu-
pancy must be classified as a Group B occupancy.

GROUP A-1

A-1 Group assemblies provide fixed seating and are intended for the use of
producing and viewing performing arts and movies. This group includes,
but is not limited to, the following:

䡲 Motion picture theaters

䡲 Symphony and concert halls

䡲 Television and radio studios that include live audiences

䡲 Theaters.

GROUP A-2

A-2 Group assemblies are intended for the consumption of food and/or
drink and include, but are not limited to, the following:

䡲 Banquet halls

䡲 Night clubs

USE AND OCCUPANCY CLASSIFICATIONS

3

䡲 Restaurants

䡲 Taverns and bars.

GROUP A-3

A-3 Group assemblies are intended for worship, recreation, or amusement
or other assembly uses but are not classified elsewhere in Group A, and 
include:

䡲 Amusement arcades

䡲 Art galleries

䡲 Bowling alleys

䡲 Places of religious worship

䡲 Community halls

䡲 Courtrooms

䡲 Dance halls (without food or drink)

䡲 Exhibition halls

䡲 Funeral parlors

䡲 Gymnasiums (without spectator seating)

䡲 Indoor swimming pools (without spectator seating)

䡲 Indoor tennis courts (without spectator seating)

䡲 Lecture halls

䡲 Libraries

䡲 Museums

䡲 Waiting areas in transportation terminals

䡲 Pool and billiard parlors.

GROUP A-4

A-4 Group assemblies are those with the intended use for viewing indoor
sporting events and activities that allow for spectator viewing. These in-
clude, but are not limited to, the following:

䡲 Arenas

4

CHAPTER 1

䡲 Skating rinks

䡲 Swimming pools

䡲 Tennis courts.

GROUP A-5

A-5 Group assembly uses are intended for participation in or viewing
outdoor activities. Some of these include, but are not limited to, the 
following:

䡲 Amusement part structures

䡲 Bleachers

䡲 Grandstands

䡲 Stadiums.

Many buildings may have multiple uses of occupancies and are referred to
as mixed occupancies. In cases with mixed occupancies, they are required
to meet the codes for those specific areas. Simply put, this means that oc-
cupancy of one group may also qualify for another. When this occurs, the
stricter code is usually enforced by code officials.

BUSINESS GROUP B

Business Group B occupancy is the use of a building or structure for office,
professional, or service-type transactions. Even if a person is using partial
space of a building for an office, it would fall into this group. The storing
of records and/or accounts is included in this as well. Below is a list of busi-
ness occupancies for group B. Keep in mind, there may be more that qual-
ify that are not listed here.

䡲 Airport traffic control towers

䡲 Animal hospitals, kennels, and pounds

䡲 Banks

䡲 Barber and beauty shops

䡲 Car washes

USE AND OCCUPANCY CLASSIFICATIONS

5

䡲 Civic administration offices

䡲 Clinic-outpatient

䡲 Dry cleaning and laundries: pick-up and delivery stations and
self-service

䡲 Educational occupancies for students above grade 12

䡲 Electronic data processing

䡲 Laboratories: testing and research

䡲 Motor vehicle showrooms

䡲 Post offices

䡲 Print shops

䡲 Professional services (architects, attorneys, dentists, physi-
cians, engineers, etc.)

䡲 Radio and television stations

䡲 Telephone exchanges

䡲 Training and skill development not within a school or aca-
demic program.

GROUP E

Educational Group E occupancy is the use of a building or structure, and
again, this can even be a portion of a structure, for educational purposes
through grade 12. However, there must be six or more people at any one
time for this structure to be classified as this group. You should note that
religious education rooms and religious auditoriums which are accessory
to places of worship fall under A-3 occupancies.

CODE UPDATE

Mercantile Group M applies to buildings where merchandise is
displayed and the sale of goods occurs.

6

CHAPTER 1

Day care and child care or personal care services for a group of five chil-
dren who are over the age of two and a half is also placed in the Group E
occupancy.

qualify as a Group H hazard or Group S storage.

䡲 Assembling

䡲 Disassembling

䡲 Fabricating

䡲 Finishing

䡲 Manufacturing

䡲 Packaging

䡲 Repairing

䡲 Processing.

GROUP F-1

Group F-1 describes the moderate-hazard occupancy of the factory indus-
try. F-2 (low factory hazards) occupancies must never be included in this
list and are in a league of their own which will be described in the next sec-
tion. The following are included in the F-1, Moderate-hazard Occupancy
Group:

䡲 Aircraft

tion of noncombustible materials. The following materials do not involve
a significant fire hazard:

䡲 Beverages: containing up to 12-percent alcohol

䡲 Brick and masonry

䡲 Ceramic products

䡲 Foundries

䡲 Glass products

䡲 Gypsum

䡲 Ice

䡲 Metal products.

GROUP H

Group H is classified as a high-hazard group that involves the manufactur-
ing, processing, generation, or storage of materials that have a physical or
health hazard. Hazardous uses are classified in Groups H-1, H-2, H-3, H-4,
and H-5. Keep in mind that these groups not only have to comply with the
code, but also the International Fire Code. There are exceptions to Group
H and the following are not to be classified as Group H, but must be clas-
sified in the occupancy that they most nearly resemble. 

USE AND OCCUPANCY CLASSIFICATIONS

9

䡲 Wholesale and retail sales and storage of flammable and com-
bustible liquids in mercantile occupancies conforming to the
International Fire Code

䡲 Closed piping containing flammable and/or combustible liq-
uids or gases that is used to operate machinery or equipment

䡲 Cleaning establishments that use combustible liquid solvents
having a flash point of 140°F (60°C) or higher in closed sys-
tems employing equipment listed by an approved testing
agency, provided that this occupancy is separated from all ar-
eas of the building by one-hour fire barriers or one-hour hor-
izontal assemblies, or both.

䡲 Cleaning establishments that utilize a liquid solvent having a
flash point at or above 200°F (93°C)

䡲 Liquor stores and distributors without bulk storage

䡲 Refrigeration systems

䡲 The storage or utilization of materials for agricultural pur-
poses on the premises

䡲 Stationary batteries used for emergency power, provided that
the batteries are provided with safety venting caps (note that
ventilation is in accordance with the International Mechanical
Code)

䡲 Corrosives cannot and do not include personal or household
products in their original packaging used for retail or com-
monly used building materials.

CODE UPDATE

An outpatient clinic is a building or a portion of a building that is
used to provide medical care on less than a 24-hour basis to
individuals who are not rendered incapable of self-preservation by
the services provided.

10

CHAPTER 1

GROUP S-1

All buildings and structures occupied for aerosol storage must be classified
as Group S-1, and again, must meet the requirements of the International
Fire Code.

The storage of black powder, smokeless propellant, and small arms
primers in Groups M and R-3 and special industrial explosive devices in
Groups B, F, M, and S must conform to the quantity limits and the Inter-
national Fire Code. 

INSTITUTIONAL GROUP I

Institutional Group I occupancy is the use of a building or structure in
which people are cared for. This can also be a live-in supervised environ-
ment as well. People who qualify for this group have physical limitations
due to health or age. Some may need medical treatment or other care. In-
stitutional occupancies are classified as Group I-1, I-2, I-3, or I-4. Qualifi-
cations for Group I are housing of more than 16 people on a 24-hour 
basis, including those receiving personal care because of age, mental dis-
ability, or other reasons, but capable of responding to an emergency situa-
tion with physical assistance from staff. These residencies include, but may
not be limited to, the following:

䡲 Residential board and care facilities

䡲 Assisted living facilities

䡲 Halfway houses

䡲 Group homes

䡲 Congregate care facilities

䡲 Social rehabilitation facilities

䡲 Alcohol and drug centers

䡲 Convalescent facilities.

If any of the facilities above have five or fewer residents, then the facility
must be classified at a Group R-3 and must comply with the International
Residential Code. If one of the facilities above has at least six, but not more

USE AND OCCUPANCY CLASSIFICATIONS

11

than 16 persons, then it must be classified as Group R-4. Group I-2 occu-
pancy includes buildings and structures that are used for medical, psychi-
atric, nursing, or custodial care on a 24-hour basis for more than five per-
sons. Care must be available on a 24-hour basis and the persons are not
capable of self-preservation. This group can include hospitals, nursing
homes (to include intermediate and skilled care), mental hospitals, and
detoxification facilities. A facility such as these that has five or fewer per-
sons must be classified as Group R-3. One thing that you must remember
is this: All facilities that provide 24-hour care and are considered to be live-
in care, must comply with the International Residential Code. Please note
that the above facilities do not include children under the age of 2 1/2. A
child care facility that provides care to five or more children in this age
bracket need to be classified as Group I-2. There is an exception to this clas-
sification: A child-care facility that provides care to more than five, but no
more than 100 children, and when the rooms in which the children are
cared for are located on the same level as an exit and each of those rooms
has a door directly to the outside shall be classified as Group E. 

I-3 FACILITIES

I-3 facilities are occupied by persons who are generally incapable of self-
preservation due to security measures that the occupants have no control
over. This group may include:

䡲 Prisons

䡲 Jails

CODE UPDATECODE UPDATE

High-hazard Group H occupancy includes, among others, the use of
a building or structure, or a portion thereof, that involves the
manufacturing, processing, generation or storage of materials that
constitute a physical or health hazard in quantities in excess of
those allowed in control areas.

12

CHAPTER 1

䡲 Reformatories

䡲 Detention centers

䡲 Correctional centers

䡲 Prerelease centers.

Buildings that qualify for Group I-3 must be classified as one of five occu-
pancy conditions. The first condition includes buildings in which free
movement is allowed from sleeping areas and other spaces where access or
occupancy is permitted to the outside of the building by means of an exit
without having to be restrained. The code allows for a Condition I facility
to be constructed as Group R. Condition II includes buildings which allow
free movement from sleeping areas to an occupied smoke compartment to
one or more other smoke compartments. Any outside exits are locked.
Condition III allows free movement within smoke compartments to group
activity spaces, but the means of exit are impeded by remote-control de-
vices. Condition IV includes buildings in which free movement is re-
stricted from an occupied space. Remote-controlled releases are used to al-
low movement from sleeping units, activity spaces, and other occupied
areas within the smoke compartment to other smoke compartments. If
your facility is classified with a Condition V then free movement is re-
stricted from an occupied space. Staff control the door locks and a manual
release is needed to permit movement from sleeping areas to other occu-
pied areas within the smoke compartment.

The next section that I want to focus on is day care facilities. These build-
ings are of the Group I classification.

CODE UPDATECODE UPDATE

A physical hazard is known as a chemical for which there is evidence
that it is a combustible liquid, cryogenic fluid, explosive, flammable,
organic peroxide, oxidizer, oxidizing gas, pyrophoric, unstable
material, or water-reactive material.

USE AND OCCUPANCY CLASSIFICATIONS

13

GROUP I-4

Group I-4 is a building or structure that is used as a day care facility. These
can be used or occupied by persons of any age who are receiving custodial
care for less than 24 hours by individuals other than parents or guardians,
blood relatives, marriage, or adoption. A facility such as above with five or
fewer persons is classified as Group R-3 and must comply with the Inter-
national Residential Code. Places of worship during religious functions are
not included.

This group also includes adult care facilities. These provide accommoda-
tions for less than 24 hours and have five or more unrelated adults who
need supervision and personal care. Take note that there is an exception to
this group: A facility where occupants are capable of responding to an
emergency situation without physical assistance from the staff is to be clas-
sified as Group A-3.

GROUP M

Group M is for Mercantile. Mercantile groups consist of buildings that dis-
play and sell merchandise. They include stocking of goods, wares, and mer-
chandise for purchase from the public. These buildings can include:

䡲 Department stores

䡲 Drug stores

䡲 Markets

䡲 Motor fuel-dispensing facilities

䡲 Retail or wholesale stores

䡲 Sales rooms.

GROUP R

Group R is for residential groups that include the use of a building for
sleeping purposes that are not classified as an Institutional Group I or
when not regulated by the International Residential Code. R-1 residential
occupancies include boarding houses, hotels, and motels that are transient
in nature. R-2 residential occupancies are those that contain sleeping units

14

CHAPTER 1

or more than two living units. These are primarily permanent in nature
and include:

䡲 Apartment houses

䡲 Boarding houses

䡲 Convents

䡲 Dormitories

䡲 Fraternities and sororities

䡲 Hotels

䡲 Monasteries

䡲 Motels

䡲 Vacation timeshare properties.

R-3 residential occupancies are those that are permanent in nature and
are not classified as R-1, R-2, R-4, or I. These include the following:

䡲 Buildings that do not contain more than two living units

䡲 Adult facilities that provide accommodations for five or fewer
persons of any age for less than 24 hours

䡲 Child care facilities that provide accommodations for five or
fewer persons of any age for less than 24 hours

䡲 Congregate living facilities with 16 or fewer persons.

R-4 is defined as residential occupancies that include buildings arranged
for occupancy as residential care/assisted living facilities including more

Fast Fact

There are many groups and many qualifying information that you
need to refer to. Always check with the codes to make sure that
your facility has the correct qualifications or you may lose any
special licensing that allows you to provide such care.

than five, but not more than 16 occupants, including staff. All R-4 occu-
pancies must meet the requirements for construction as defined for Group
R-3, except as otherwise provided in this book or the International Resi-
dential Code.

GROUP S

Group S is the storage group. This group will tell you what you may store
in your building or structure that is not classified as a hazardous occu-
pancy. Group S-1 is moderate-hazard storage and includes, but is not lim-
ited to aerosols of levels 2 and 3, baskets, boots and shoes, furs and leathers.
Group S-2 includes buildings used for the storage of noncombustible ma-
terials such as products on wood pallets or in paper cartons with or with-
out divisions and products such as knobs, handles, or film wrapping. Stor-
age uses include, but are not limited to, storage of the following:

䡲 Aircraft hangar

䡲 Beverages containing up to 12-percent alcohol in metal, glass,
or ceramic containers

䡲 Chalk and crayons

䡲 Dry cell batteries

䡲 Empty cans

䡲 Food products

䡲 Glass

䡲 Gypsum board

䡲 Inert pigments

䡲 Ivory

䡲 Meats

䡲 Metal parts.

You can see that buildings and structures of an accessory character and
miscellaneous structures not classified in any specific occupancy must be
constructed, equipped, and maintained to conform to the requirements of
this code with the fire and life hazard to their occupancy. 

16

GROUP U

CHAPTER 1

There is one more group that is called Group U, a miscellaneous group that
can include the following:

䡲 Agricultural buildings

䡲 Aircraft hangars

䡲 Barns

䡲 Carports

䡲 Fences more than 6 feet high

䡲 Grain silos, accessory to a residential occupancy

䡲 Greenhouses

䡲 Livestock shelters

䡲 Private garages

䡲 Retaining walls

䡲 Sheds

䡲 Stables

䡲 Tanks

䡲 Towers.

This brings us to the close of Chapter 1 and the occupancy classification of
all buildings and structures. As you can see there are many exceptions that
you must be aware of when constructing your building or structure. Read
the code book, follow and implement the code, and if you ever have any
questions, don’t hesitate to contact your building official. They are there to
help you.

Special Detailed Requirements 
Based on Use and Occupancy

In Chapter 2 we will explore the provisions and apply them to the special
uses of occupancy along with the occupancy and construction require-
ments of this code.

This section will apply to buildings or structures that are defined as covered
mall buildings that do not exceed three floors at any point or not more
than three stories above grade plane. Covered mall buildings must meet
applicable provisions of this code except as specifically required. There are
two exceptions. The first one states that foyers and lobbies of Groups B, 
R-1, and R-2 are not required to comply with this section. The second says
that buildings do not need to comply with the section when they totally
comply with other provisions of this code. Please note the word “totally,”
if your building does not comply with the fullest extent required then you
will not be meeting the code standards.

For this chapter there are a few words and their definitions that I’d like to
explore. They are used in this chapter and throughout this code book. They

CHAPTER 2

! De f in i t iona le r t

Atrium: An opening connecting two or more stories, other than
enclosed stairways, elevators, hoistways, escalators, plumbing,
electrical, air-conditioning, or other equipment, which is closed at
the top and not defined as a mall. Stories, as used in this definition,
do not include balconies within assembly groups or mezzanines
that comply with Chapter 5 of the code.

will not be written in text such as this, but you will find them as “Defini-
tion Alerts” throughout the book. Pay attention to them as they will come
in handy and will be words that you need to be familiar with.

COVERED MALL BUILDINGS

The occupant load factor (OLF) is used in a formula to determine the
means of exits of covered mall buildings and the number of occupants the
exits is to be provided for. The means of exits are based on gross leasable
area (GLA) of the covered mall building, but this excludes anchor build-
ings. The occupant load factor is determined by the following equation:
OLF ⫽ (0.00007) (GLA) ⫹ 25

The range for the OLF is not required to be less than 30 and must not ex-
ceed 50.

! De f in i t iona le r t

Covered mall building: A single building enclosing a number of
tenants and occupants such as retail stores, drinking and dining
establishments, entertainment and amusement facilities. This
includes passenger transportation terminals, offices, and other
similar uses where two or more tenants have a main entrance into
one or more malls. 

SPECIAL DETAILED REQUIREMENTS BASED ON USE AND OCCUPANCY

19

! De f in i t i ona le r t

Anchor building: An exterior perimeter building of a group other
than H having direct access to a covered mall building, but having
the required exits independent of the mall. 

Note the definition for covered mall building; I must tell you that for the
purpose of this chapter, anchor buildings are not to be considered as part
of the covered mall building.

For the purpose of determining the occupant load of a food court and 
exits, the food court occupant load needs to be added to the occupant load
of the covered mall building as the calculation above. 

If the travel used by any persons other than employees is more than 75 feet
and your occupancy load is 50 people or more then you may not provide
less than two exits. Assembly occupancies with an occupant load of 500 or
more must be located in the covered mall building so that their entrance is

than one-half of their required exits opening directly to the outside of the

Fast Fact

Anchor building exit requirements are different from the covered
mall. The exits for anchor buildings must be provided independently
form the malls means of exits. The occupant load of anchor
buildings opening into the mall are not included in the determining
means of exits for the mall either. Also the exit path of any mall
cannot exit through anchor buildings. The mall is considered to be a
dead-end mall when it ends at an anchor building and there are no
other means of exit.

Fast Fact

The distance of exits for each individual tenant space in a covered
mall building cannot exceed 200 feet. This travel is from any point
to an exit or entrance and the maximum distance of travel from any
point within a mall is also 200 feet.

Whether from an individual store or anywhere in the mall, there must be
an exit no more than 200 feet away. Where more than one exit is required,
they must be arranged so that is the travel in either direction from any
point in the mall to separate exits. The passageway of an exit or corridor
must be 66 inches. The exception to this is dead ends that exceed a length
equal to twice the width of the mall measuring from the narrowest location
within the dead end portion of the mall. Exit passageways providing a sec-
ondary means of exit from a tenant space must be protected by one-hour
fire doors that are self- or automatic closing by smoke detection. Mechan-
ical rooms, electrical room, building service areas, and service elevators are
permitted to open directly into exit passageways, provided that the exit
passageway is separated from these rooms with not less than one-hour fire-
resistance-rated fire barriers and one-hour opening protective devices.

Attached garages used for the storage of passenger vehicles which have a
capacity of nine or more passengers and open parking garages are consid-
ered separate buildings as they are separated from the covered mall build-
ing by a fire barrier having a fire-resistance rating or at least two hours. One
exception applies: Where an open parking garage or enclosed parking

FIRE-RESISTANCE SEPARATIONS

Fire-resistance separations not only apply to parking garages and malls,
but also to the tenants. Each tenant space must be separated from other
tenant spaces by a fire partition that complies with the fire-resistance code
section of this book. A tenant separation wall is not required between any
tenant space and the mall. Anchor buildings need to be separated from the
covered mall building unless the anchor building is not more than three
stories above grade plane and has an occupancy classification the same that
is permitted for tenants of the covered mall building that must be separated
by two-hour fire-resistant fire barriers. 

A covered mall building must be equipped throughout with a standpipe
system as required by code. The code requires more than just fire-resistant
walls and sprinkler systems for different areas of a covered mall building.

Automatic sprinkler systems are required for covered mall buildings
and buildings that are connected to them. 

For example, kiosks or other similar structures (both temporary and per-
manent) cannot be located within the mall unless constructed of fire-retar-
dant wood that complies with the code, foam plastics that have a maxi-
mum heat release rate not greater than 100kW (105 Btu/h) when tested in
accordance with the exhibit booth protocol in UL 1975 or aluminum com-
posite material (ACM) having a flame spread index of not more than 25
and a smoke-developed index of not more than 450 when tested as an as-
sembly in the maximum thickness intended for use in accordance with
ASTM E 84. All kiosks or similar structures located within the mall must
also be provided with approved fire suppression and detection devices.
Spacing within kiosks or similar structures must be at least 20 feet (6096
mm) and they must have a maximum area of 300 square feet. There are
many structures that require special detailed requirements besides mall
buildings or garages. 

CHILDREN’S PLAYGROUNDS

Structures that are intended as children’s playgrounds that exceed 10 feet
in height and 150 square feet must comply with the following:

Any playground structure for the use of children located within a mall
must be provided with the same level of approved fire suppression and de-
tection devices required for kiosks and similar structures. Children’s play-
ground structures are also required, just as kiosks are, to be separated from
other structures. Playground structures are required to have a minimum
horizontal separation of 20 feet from any other structures within the mall.
They also have an area limit and cannot exceed 300 square feet unless a spe-
cial investigation has demonstrated adequate fire safety.

24

SECURITY

CHAPTER 2

One of the most important safety features of covered malls is security
grilles and doors. Horizontal sliding or vertical security grilles or doors that
are part of a required means of exit have to conform to rules as well. These
rules are:

䡲 They must remain in the full open position during the time pe-
riods that the mall is occupied by the general public.
䡲 Doors or grilles cannot be closed when there are 10 or more
persons occupying a space that has only one exit or when there
are 50 or more persons occupying a space that has more than
one exit.
䡲 The doors or grilles must be able to be open from the inside of
the building without the use of any special knowledge or spe-
cial efforts where the space is occupied.
䡲 Where two or more exits are required, not more than one-half
of the exits are permitted to include a horizontal sliding or ver-
tical rolling grille or door.

It is mandatory that covered mall buildings that exceed 50,000 square feet
be provided with standby power systems that are capable of operating the
emergency communication system. These emergency voice/alarm com-
munication systems must be accessible to the fire department.

PLASTIC SIGNS

Plastic signs that are applied to the storefront of any tenant space facing the
mall must adhere to the following rules in accordance with this code.

CODE UPDATECODE UPDATE

Exits in malls are subject to the same fire resistance requirements
as interior wall and ceiling finishes.

SPECIAL DETAILED REQUIREMENTS BASED ON USE AND OCCUPANCY

25

䡲 Plastic signs must not exceed 20 percent of the wall area facing
the mall.
䡲 Plastic signs must not exceed a height of 36 inches (914 mm),
except if the sign is vertical, the height cannot be higher than
96 inches (2438 mm), and the width cannot be wider than 36
inches (914 mm).
䡲 Plastic signs must be located a minimum distance of at least 18
inches (457 mm) from adjacent tenants.
䡲 Plastics other than foam used in signs must be light-transmit-
ting plastics and shall have a self-ignition temperature of 650°F
(343°C) or greater when tested in accordance with ASTM D
1929, and a flame spread index not greater than 75 and smoke-
developed index not greater than 450 when tested in the man-
ner intended for use in accordance with ASTM E 84.
䡲 Edges and backs of plastic signs in the mall must be fully en-
cased in metal.
䡲 Foam plastics used in signs must have a maximum heat-release
rate of 150 kilowatts when tested in accordance with UL 1975
and the foam plastics must have the physical characteristics
specified in this section. Foam plastics used in signs installed in
accordance with this section are not required to comply with
the flame spread and smoke-developed indexes specified in
plastics.
䡲 The minimum density of foam plastics used in signs must not
be less than 20 pounds per cubic foot (pcf) and the thickness
must not be greater than ½ inch (12.7 mm).

HIGH-RISE BUILDINGS

The provisions of this section apply to buildings with an occupied floor
located more than 75 feet above the lowest level of fire department vehi-
cle access. There are five exceptions to these provisions which include the
following:

䡲 Airport traffic control towers
䡲 Open parking spaces

26

CHAPTER 2

CODE UPDATECODE UPDATE

Malls that contain atriums must be equipped with smoke-control
systems.

䡲 Buildings with occupancy in Group A-5
䡲 Low-hazard special industrial occupancies
䡲 Buildings with occupancy in Group H-1, H-2, or H-3.

Buildings and structures must be equipped throughout with an automatic
sprinkler system and a secondary water supply where required. We know
from earlier discussion that open parking garages are an exception to this
provision. A reduction in fire-resistant rating is allowed in buildings that
have sprinkler control valves equipped with supervisory initiating devices
and water flow initiating devices for each floor. For buildings not greater
than 420 feet in height, Type IA construction is allowed to be reduced to
Type IB with the exception of columns supporting the floor which may not
be allowed to be reduced. 

For buildings not greater than 420 feet in height, the required fire-resist-
ance rating of the fire barriers enclosing vertical shafts, other than exit en-
closures and elevator hoistway enclosures, must be reduced to one hour
where automatic sprinklers are installed within the shafts at the top and at
alternate floor levels. If standby power is a generator and is set inside a
building, the generator must be located in a separate room that is enclosed
with two-hour fire barriers. Any systems you use with a manual ignition
and transfer features have to be provided at the fire command center. 

Standby power loads can be any of the following: power and lighting for
the fire command center, electrically powered fire pumps and ventilation,
and automatic fire detection equipment for smokeproof enclosures. All 
elevators must have standby power. The following is a list of what is classi-
fied as an emergency power load:

䡲 Exit signs and means of exits that are illuminated
䡲 Elevator car lighting

SPECIAL DETAILED REQUIREMENTS BASED ON USE AND OCCUPANCY

27

䡲 Emergency voice/alarm communication systems
䡲 Automatic fire detection systems
䡲 Fire alarm systems.

UNDERGROUND BUILDINGS

In this section I will touch upon underground building spaces and the
codes that apply to them. The building spaces that I refer to have a floor
level used for human occupancy more than 30 feet below the lowest level
of exits. There are a few exceptions to this. They are as follows:

䡲 One- and two-family dwellings, having a compliant sprinkler
system
䡲 Parking garages with compliant automatic sprinkler systems
䡲 Fixed guide way transit systems
䡲 Grandstands, bleachers, stadiums, arenas, and similar facilities
䡲 When the lowest story of a building is the only one that would
qualify the building as an underground building. That build-
ing must not have an area that exceeds 1500 square feet and
have an occupant load that is less than 10.

The underground portion of a building must be of Type I construction and
the highest level of exit must be equipped with an automatic sprinkler sys-
tem with water-flow valve switches and control valves that are supervised.

Underground buildings that have a floor level or more than 60 feet (18,288
mm) below the level of exit must be divided into two compartments. These
compartments must be of an approximately equal size and extend through
the highest level of exit discharge that serve the underground portion of the
building and the levels below. As you may have guessed, there is an excep-
tion to this. If the area does not exceed 1500 square feet and has an occu-
pant load of less than 10, the lowest story does not need to be compart-
mented. Each compartment needs to be separated by a smoke barrier wall
and penetrations between the compartments will be limited to plumbing
and electrical piping and conduit that are fire stopped. 

Doorways must be protected by fire door assemblies that close automati-
cally when smoke alarms go off. When provided, each compartment must

have an air supply and an exhaust system that is independent of other com-
partments. Doors must be installed in accordance with NFPA 105. If eleva-
tors are provided, each compartment must have access to an elevator. If an
elevator serves more than one compartment, an elevator lobby must be pro-
vided and be separated by a smoke barrier. Make sure that when installing
elevators the doors are gasketed and have a drop sill. They must also have
automatic closing by smoke detection. 

When compartmentation is required, each compartment needs to have an
independent smoke control system. It must be automatically activated and
capable of manual operation. Underground buildings can require both fire
alarm systems and a public address system. Each floor of an underground
building must have a minimum of two exits; if compartmentation is re-
quired then the compartments must have a minimum of one exit and have
an exit access doorway into an adjoining compartment. 

Staircases in underground buildings that serve floor levels of more than 30
feet below their level of exit must comply with the requirements for a
smoke proof enclosure. It is important that your underground building
have standby power and emergency power for blackouts, storms, or other
situations which cause power outages. Having these systems in place can
save lives and make exiting the building easier. Listed below are loads
which classify as standby power loads:

䡲 Smoke control system
䡲 Ventilation and automatic fire detection equipment for
smokeproof enclosures
䡲 Fire pumps.

The standby power system must start up within 60 seconds after the failure
of normal power supply. As I have listed loads for standby power, I will do
so for emergency power loads as well.

GROUP I-2 MEDICAL FACILITIES

Corridors in occupancies in Group I-2 must be continuous to the exits and
separated from other areas in accordance with corridor walls except spaces
conforming to the following paragraphs. Spaces of unlimited areas such as
waiting areas and similar spaces constructed for corridors must be permitted
to be open to a corridor, but only when the following requirements are met:

䡲 The spaces are not occupied for patient sleeping units, treat-
ment rooms, hazardous, or incidental use in mixed uses and
occupancy.
䡲 The open space is protected by an automatic fire detection sys-
tem installed in accordance with the code.
䡲 The corridors onto which the spaces open, in the same smoke
compartment, need to be protected by an automatic fire detec-
tion system installed. Smoke compartment located in the
spaces are to be equipped throughout with quick-response
sprinklers.
䡲 The space is arranged so that it does not obstruct the exit.

䡲 Each area must not exceed 1500 square feet.
䡲 The area is to be located so that supervision by the facility staff
is permitted.
䡲 The area is to be arranged so that access to exits is not ob-
structed in any way.
䡲 The area is to be equipped with an automatic fire detection system.
䡲 Not more than one such space is permitted in any one smoke
compartment.
䡲 The walls and ceilings of the space are to be constructed as re-
quired for corridors.

In these types of facilities there is almost always a gift shop where visitors
and patients may go to purchase small items such as gum, flowers, daily
newspapers or magazines, if permitted. These gift shops must be less than
500 square feet in area and must be permitted to be open to the corridor
provided the gift shop and storage areas are fully equipped with sprinklers
and the storage areas are protected in accordance with this code.

Corridor walls must be constructed as smoke partitions. Doors, other than
those in a wall required to be rated or for the enclosure of a vertical open-
ing or an exit, shall not have a required fire protection rating and are not
required to be equipped with self-closing or automatic-closing devices.
These automatic-closing devices must provide an effective barrier to limit

smoke and cannot be equipped with positive latching. Roller latches are
not permitted. 

When locks are in place and restrict access to the patient room from the
corridor and can only be used by the staff from the corridor side, they can-
not obstruct or restrict any means of exits from the patient room except for
patient rooms in mental health facilities. 

Smoke barriers in health facilities must be provided to subdivide every
story used by patients for sleeping or treatment. Smoke barriers must also
divide other stories with an occupant load of 50 or more persons into at
least two smoke compartments. These stories have to be divided in smoke
compartments with an area of not more than 22,500 square feet and the
travel distance from any point in a smoke compartment to a smoke barrier
door must not exceed 200 feet. Should the need arise, a refuge area must be
provided. At least 30 net square feet per patient must be provided within
the aggregate area of corridors, patient rooms, treatments rooms, lounge
or dining areas and other low-hazard areas on each side of each smoke bar-
rier. On the floors that do not have patients confined to a bed, at least 6 net
square feet per occupant must be provided on each side of each smoke bar-
rier for the total number of occupants in adjoining smoke compartments. 

All smoke compartments have to provide an independent means of exit so
that staff, residents, patients, and family do not have to return through the
smoke compartment to get to safety. Automatic sprinkler systems must be
installed in smoke compartments that contain patient sleeping areas. The
smoke compartments must also be equipped with an approved quick-re-
sponse or residential sprinklers.

Automatic fire detection for corridors in nursing homes, both intermediate
and skilled nursing facilities, detoxification facilities, and spaces permitted
to be open to the corridors which I mentioned as an independent exit must
also be equipped with an automatic fire detection system. Hospitals also
must have smoke detection installed as required. There are two exceptions:

䡲 Corridor smoke detection is not required where patient sleep-
ing units are provided with smoke detectors that comply with
UL 268. These detectors must provide a visual display on the
corridor side of each patient sleeping unit and an audible and
visual alarm at the nursing station that monitors each unit.

vices with integral smoke detectors on the inside of the units.
These must be installed in accordance with their listing, pro-
vided that the detectors perform the required alerting function.

Some facilities have secured yards installed for the safety of the patients and
staff. Grounds are permitted to be fenced and gates are permitted to be
equipped with locks provided that safe dispersal areas having 30 net square
feet for bed and litter patients and 6 net square feet for patients who can
walk and other occupants are located between the building and the fence.
These safe dispersal areas cannot be located less than 50 feet from the
building that they are used for.

I-3 DIFFERENT OCCUPANCIES 

Not all facilities that house patients for various reasons are necessarily
medical. There are buildings and structures that occupy patients for crim-
inal activities. Where security operations need the locking of required
means of exits, provisions must be made for the release of occupants at all
times. Exits from detention and correctional occupancies that pass

through other areas of use must, as a minimum, conform to requirements
for detention and correctional occupancies. It is possible to exit through a
horizontal exit into other adjoining occupancy exit provisions that do
comply with requirements used in the appropriate occupancy, as long as
the occupancy is not a high-hazard use. The means of exit must comply
with the code book except as modified or as provided for in this section.
Doors to resident sleeping areas need to have clear width of no less than 28
inches. If the door used for an exit is a sliding door, the force to slide the
door fully open cannot exceed 50 pounds with an upright force against the
door of 50 pounds.

Facilities may have exit doors that lead into a fenced or walled courtyard.
These courtyards must be of a size that accommodates all occupants with
a minimum of 50 feet from the building with a net area of 15 square feet
per person. During an emergency at a correctional facility a sally port may
be used as a means of exits when there are provisions for continuous and
unobstructed passage through the sally port during an emergency exit con-
dition. Of all the required exit enclosures in each building, one of them
may be permitted to have glazing installed in each door and inside walls at
each landing level providing access to the enclosure, only if the following
conditions are met:

䡲 The exit enclosure cannot serve more than four floor levels.

䡲 Exit doors cannot be less than ¾-hour fire door assemblies.

䡲 The total area of glazing at each floor level cannot exceed 5000
square inches and individual panels of glazing cannot exceed
1296 square inches.

䡲 The glazing will be protected on both sides by an automatic fire
sprinkler system. The sprinkler system will be designed to com-
pletely soak the entire surface of any glazing affected by fire.

䡲 The glazing must be in a gasketed frame and installed in such
a manner that the framing system will deflect without breaking
the glass before the sprinkler system turns on.

䡲 Obstructions, such as curtain rods, drapery rods, curtains,
drapes, or similar materials will not be installed between the
automatic sprinklers and the glazing.

34

CHAPTER 2

Exit doors are allowed to be locked in accordance with the appropriate use.
Doors from an area of protection to the outside are permitted to be locked
with a key. The keys to unlock the outside doors must be available at all
times and the locks must be operable from both sides of the door. If the
locks on the doors to exits are of a remote release, they must be provided
with a reliable means of operation. There is a great risk that one is taking
in their own hands if the remote release does not work due to poor main-
tenance or by any other means. Human lives can be lost if these types of
locks are not checked periodically for bugs in the system. If at any time you
find that these types of locks are not working, report it to your supervisor
immediately so that it may be fixed in a timely manner. Think about this,
would you prefer the building inspector or an employee to find this poten-
tially dangerous matter?

In occupancy Conditions III and IV, the arrangement, accessibility, and secu-
rity of the release mechanism(s) required for exit must have the minimum
available staff at any time, the lock mechanisms are capable of being released
within two minutes. Provisions for remote locking and unlocking of occupied
rooms in Occupancy Condition IV are not required provided that not more
than 10 locks are necessary to be unlocked in order to move occupants from one
smoke compartment to a safe area within three minutes. 

Opening of necessary locks must be accomplished with not more than two
separate keys. Power-operated doors and locks are very different from re-
mote release and as the owner, manager, or supervisor of Group I-3 occu-
pancy, it is important that you know what the difference is and understand
the use of the locking systems. Let us take a look at them now.

Power-Operated Sliding Doors

Power-operated sliding doors or power-operated locks for swinging doors
must be used by a manual release mechanism at the door, and either emer-
gency power or a remote operating release must be provided. But, emer-
gency power is not required in facilities with 10 locks or less when comply-
ing with the exception of the codes for remote release.

Remote release, mechanically operated sliding doors or remote release,
mechanically operated locks must be provided with a mechanically oper-
ated release mechanism at each door, or must be provided with a redun-

dant remote release control. Doors that are unlocked remotely under
emergency conditions must not automatically relock when closed unless
specific action is taken at the remote location to enable the door to relock.

Vertical Openings

Vertical openings must be enclosed with these exceptions: 

䡲 An opening in the floor, between floor levels of residential
housing areas, is allowed without enclosure protection be-
tween the levels provided that the entire, normally occupied
areas that are interconnected are open and unobstructed to al-
low supervisory personnel visual access to the areas.
䡲 Exit space is plenty enough to provide immediate exits for all
occupants from all connected levels and areas.
䡲 The height difference between the highest and lowest finished
floor levels cannot exceed 23 feet (7010 m).
䡲 Each level will be considered separately.
䡲 Occupancies in Group I-3 also must have smoke barriers that
divide every floor occupied by residents for sleeping, or any
floor having an occupant load of 50 or more persons. The di-
vision must be made into at least two smoke compartments. 

There is an exception to the guidelines above. Spaces having a direct exit to
one of the following, provided that the locking arrangements of the doors
involved comply with the requirements for doors at the smoke barrier for
the condition involved to be:

䡲 A public way

36

CHAPTER 2

䡲 A building separated from the resident housing area by a two-
hour fire-resistance-rated assembly or 50 feet (15,240 mm) of
open space.
䡲 A secured yard or court having a holding space 50 feet from the
housing area that proved 6 square feet or more of safety area
per occupant. This includes residents, staff, and visitors.

Smoke compartments require that the maximum number of residents in
any smoke compartment will be 200. The travel distance to a door in a
smoke barrier from any room door required as exit access will not be
longer than 150 feet. The distance to a door in a smoke barrier from any
point in that room cannot be longer than 200 feet. In the event of an emer-
gency, such as fire, not only is it important to have a safe place for people
to flee to, but it is a code law. Facilities housing detention and correctional
occupancies require at least 6 net square feet per occupant. This space must
be readily available wherever the occupants are moved across the smoke
barrier in a fire emergency. 

An exit must be provided from each compartment that is created by smoke
barriers without having occupants escape through the smoke compart-
ment by the original exits. Resident housing areas and sleeping areas and
any nearby day rooms, group activity space, or other common spaces
where residents live must be separated from other spaces in accordance
with the following:

䡲 Occupancy Conditions III and IV: Each sleeping area in these
conditions must be separated from nearby common spaces by
a smoke-tight partition where the distance from the sleeping
area through the common area to the corridor is more than 50
feet.
䡲 Occupancy Condition V: Each sleeping area in occupancy con-
dition V will be separated from nearby sleeping areas, corri-
dors, and common spaces by a smoke-tight partition.
䡲 Openings in rooms: The combined area must include all open-
ings, such as door undercuts, food passes, and grilles. Open-
ings cannot be more than 36 inches above the floor and the
openings must be closeable from the room side.

䡲 Latches and door closures are not required on cell doors.

For the purposes of this section, a windowless building or part of a building
is one with windows that do not open, break easily, or without windows.
Windowless buildings must be provided with an engineered smoke control
system to provide ventilation. This can be either mechanical or natural, but
must be in accordance with the code for each windowless compartment.

STAGES AND PLATFORMS

This section includes provisions to all parts of buildings and structures that
contain stages or platforms and similar additions as defined.

A stage is defined as a space within a building used for entertainment or pre-
sentations, which includes overhead hanging curtains, drops, scenery or
stage effects other than lighting, and sound. Stages must be constructed of

for hanging or flying scenery and other stage effects.

䡲 Stages of Type IIB or IV construction with a normal 2-inch (51
mm) wood deck, provided that the stage is separated from
other areas in accordance with this section.
䡲 In buildings of Type IIA, IIIA, and VA construction, a fire-resist-
ance-rated floor is not required, provided the space below the
stage is equipped with an automatic fire-extinguishing system.
䡲 In all types of construction, the finished floor must be con-
structed of wood or approved noncombustible materials. 
䡲 Openings through stage floors must be equipped with tight-
fitting, solid wood trap doors with approved safety locks.
䡲 Stage height and area must be measured to include the entire
performance area and adjacent backstage and support areas
not separated from the performance area by fire-resistance-
rated construction.
䡲 Stage height must be measured form the lowest point on the
stage floor to the highest point of the roof or floor deck above
the stage.

Galleries, gridirons, catwalks, and pinrails must use beams that are de-
signed for this purpose only, the beams must be constructed of approved
materials consistent with the requirements for the type of construction of
the buildings, and a fire-resistance rating is not required. The areas will not
be considered to be floors, stories, mezzanines, or levels when applying this
code; an exception to remember is this: Floors of fly galleries and catwalks
must be constructed of any approved material.

Stage Doors

Exterior stage doors must be protected with fire door assemblies. Exterior
openings that are located on the stage for means of exit or loading and un-

loading purposes, and are likely to be open during occupancy of the the-
ater, must be constructed with vestibules to prevent air drafts into the the-
ater. In the event that the stage height is greater than 50 feet, all portions of
the stage must be completely separated from the seating area by a wall with
no less than a two-hour fire-resistance rating extending continuously from
the foundation to the roof. 

Where the separated wall is required to have a fire-resistance rating, the
stage opening must have a fire curtain of approved material or an approved
water curtain that complies with the code. The fire curtain must be de-
signed and installed to intercept hot gases, flames, and smoke and to pre-
vent a glow from a severe fire on the stage from showing on the auditorium
side for a period of 20 minutes. The closing of the fire curtain from the full
open position must be accomplished in less than 30 seconds, with the last
8 feet of travel requiring five or more seconds for full closure. The curtain
must be activated by rate-of-rise heat detection installed in accordance
with the code, operating at a rate of temperature rise of 15 to 20°F per
minute, and by a secondary manual control. 

A sample curtain with a minimum of two vertical seams must be subjected
to the standard fire test specified in ASTM E 119 for a period of 30 min-
utes. The curtain will overlap the furnace edges by an amount that is ap-
propriated to seal the top and sides. There will be a bottom pocket on the
curtain that contains a minimum of 4 pounds per linear foot of batten. The
exposed surface of the curtain mustn’t glow, and flame or smoke must not
penetrate the curtain during the test period. Unexposed surface tempera-
ture and hose stream test requirements are not applicable to the wall fire
safety curtain test. The fabric of the curtains that are used in such cases
must have a smoke-developed rating of 25 or less when tested in accor-
dance with ASTM E 84. The completed curtain that is in place between the
stage and the wall will be subjected to operating tests prior to the issuance
of a certificate of occupancy.

CHAPTER 2

COMBUSTIBLE MATERIALS

Most plays and theater production use some kind of scenery or props to
enhance performances. Combustible materials used in sets and scenery
must meet the fire movement performance criteria of NFPA 701 and the
International Fire Code. Foam plastics and materials containing foam
plastics must comply with the chapter regarding plastics and the Interna-
tional Fire Code.

Emergency ventilation must be provided for stages larger than 1000 square
feet in floor area, or with a stage height greater than 50 feet. This ventila-
tion must comply with one or both of the requirements of the code.

Roof Vents

Two or more roof vents constructed to open automatically by approved
heat-activated devices and with an aggregate clear opening area of not less
than 5 percent of the area of the stage can be located near the center and
above the highest part of the stage area. Supplemental means must be pro-
vided for manual operation of the ventilator. Curbs must be provided as
required for skylights and vents must be labeled. 

Smoke control must be provided to maintain the smoke layer crossing
point not less than 6 feet above the highest level of the assembly seating or
above the top of the space where the stage is separated from the seating area
or where a wall is provided in this space.

Fast Fact

The code is much different for temporary platforms and states that
platforms installed for a period of not more than 30 days are
permitted to be constructed of any materials permitted by the code.
But, the space between the floor and the temporary platform can
only be used for plumbing and electrical wiring to platform
equipment. Be sure that you know the difference in codes for
permanent and temporary platforms.

Fast Fact

Stage exits must have at least one approved means of exit from
each side of the stage and from each side of space under the stage.
At least one of these exits must be provided from each fly gallery
and from the gridiron. Steel ladders, alternating tread stairways or
spiral stairways are means of exits that are permitted to be used
from the gridiron to a scuttle in the stage roof.

Platform Construction

Platform construction for permanent platforms must be constructed of
materials as required for the type of construction of the building where
your platform is going to be located. Permanent platforms are allowed to
be constructed of fire-retardant-treated wood for Type I, II, and IV con-
struction where the platforms are no more than 30 inches above the main
floor, and are not more than one-third of the room floor area and not more
than 3000 square feet in area. If the space beneath the permanent platform
is used for storage or any other purpose other than equipment, wiring, or
plumbing, the floor construction cannot be less than one-hour fire-resist-
ance-rated construction. If the space beneath the permanent platform is
used only for equipment, wiring, or plumbing, the underside of the perma-
nent platform does not need to be protected. 

Dressing Rooms

All dressing rooms and appurtenant rooms must comply with the follow-
ing section. If the stage height is greater than 50 feet, the stage needs to be
separated from dressing rooms, scene docks, property rooms, workshops,
storerooms, and compartments that are an extension to the stage and other
parts of the building by a fire barrier with no less than a two-hour fire-re-
sistance rating with approved opening protections. If the stage is 50 feet or
less, the required stage separation must be a fire barrier with no less than a
one-hour fire-resistance rating with approved protective openings. You
must make all dressing rooms, scene decks, property rooms, workshops,
storerooms, and compartments that are extended to the stage separated

from each other as well. They must have fire barriers with not less than a
one-hour fire-resistance rating with approved protected openings.

Automatic Sprinkler Systems

You have learned from the previous paragraphs that all buildings or struc-
tures require an automatic sprinkler system. The codes for each building
are not quite the same, so it is very important that you don’t apply one sec-
tion to another. The automatic sprinkler code for stages and platforms is
the following: Stages must be equipped with an automatic fire-extinguish-
ing system. Sprinklers must be installed under the roof and gridiron and
under all catwalks and galleries over the stage. Sprinklers must be installed
in dressing rooms, performer lounges, shops, and storerooms accessory to
the stages. The exceptions to this are that sprinklers are not required under
stage areas less than 4 feet in clear height that are used exclusively for stor-
age of table and chairs, provided that the concealed space is separated from
the adjacent spaces by no less than 5/8-inch Type X gypsum board. Sprin-
klers are also not required for stages that are 1000 square feet or less in area
and 50 feet or less in height where curtains, scenery, or other combustible
hangings are not vertically retractable. Combustible hangings must be lim-
ited to a single main curtain, border, legs, and a single backdrop. Sprinklers
are also not required within portable orchestra enclosures on stages. 

AIRCRAFT-RELATED OCCUPANCIES

Fire suppression must be provided to aircraft hangars as required by NFPA
409, with the exception that Group II hangars as defined in NFPA 409 stor-
ing private aircraft without major maintenance or overhaul are exempt
from foam suppression requirements.

A hangar cannot be attached to a dwelling unless separated by a fire barrier
having a fire-resistance rating of no less than one hour. This separation
must be continuous from the foundation to the underside of the roof and
un-pierced except for doors leading to the dwelling unit. Doors into the
dwelling unit must be equipped with self-closing devices with at least a 
4-inch noncombustible raised sill. Openings from a hangar directly into a
room used for sleeping purposes are not permitted.

Smoke alarms must be provided within the hangar in accordance with the
code. All electrical, mechanical, and plumbing drain, waste, and vent or
DWV systems installed within the hangar must be independent of the sys-
tems installed inside the home. Building sewer lines will be permitted to be
connected outside the structures with the exception of smoke detector
wiring and feed for electrical sub panels in the hangar.

Any aircraft painting operations where the use or storage of flammable liq-
uids in excess of the maximum allowable quantities per control area have
to be conducted in an aircraft paint hangar that complies with this section.
Spray equipment and cleaning operations must be conducted in a liquid
use, dispensing and mixing room.

46

CHAPTER 2

Aircraft paint hangars must be classified as Group H-2. Aircraft paint
hangars must comply with the applicable requirements of this code and the
International Fire Code for such occupancy. The construction of such
paint hangars will be of Type I or II construction. 

All flammable liquids must be stored in a liquid storage room, and aircraft
paint hangars must be provided with fire suppression as required by NFPA
409; all aircraft paint hangars will be provided with ventilation as required
by the International Mechanical Code.

COMBUSTIBLE STORAGE

Combustible storage is always a potential concern. High-pile stock or rack
storage in any occupancy group will comply with the International Fire
Code. Attic, under-floor, and concealed spaces used for storage of com-
bustible materials will be protected on the storage side as required for 
one-hour fire-resistance-rated construction. Openings will be protected by
assemblies that are self-closing and are of non-combustible construction
on solid wood core no less than 1¾ inches in thickness. The exceptions to
this include areas that are protected by automatic sprinkler systems and
Group R-3 and U occupancies.

HAZARDOUS MATERIALS

Buildings and structures with occupancy in Group H, that house haz-
ardous materials, will also comply with the applicable provisions of this
section and the International Fire Code.

The safe design of hazardous material occupancies is material dependent.
Level 2 and 3 aerosol products will be stored and displayed in accordance
with the International Fire Code for occupancy group requirements. 

Separate floor plans must be submitted for buildings and structures with
occupancy in Group H, identifying the locations of anticipated contents
and processes to reflect the nature of each occupied portion of every build-
ing and structure. A report identifying hazardous materials including, but
not limited to, materials that represent hazards that are classified in Group
H to be stored or used, must be submitted and the methods that you plan
on storing and protecting these hazards have to be indicated on the con-

struction documents. The opinion and report has to be prepared by a qual-
ified person, firm, or corporation by the building official and will be pro-
vided free of charge to the enforcing agency.

Control areas need to be kept separate from each other by fire barriers or
horizontal assemblies, or both. The percentage of maximum allowable
quantities of hazardous materials per control area permitted at each floor
will be in accordance with code recommendations, as do the maximum
number of control areas per building and the fire-resistance-rating re-
quirements. There are two exceptions for the fire-resistance-rating re-
quirements. These are: The floor construction of the control area and the
construction supporting the floor of the control area are allowed to be one-
hour fire-resistance rated in buildings of Type IIA, IIIA, and VA construc-
tion provided that the building is equipped throughout with an automatic
sprinkler system and the building is three stories or less in height.

The aggregate quantity of nonflammable solid and nonflammable or non-
combustible liquid hazardous materials permitted in Group M display
and storage area, a Group S storage area, or an outdoor control area is per-
mitted to exceed the maximum allowable quantities per control area spec-
ified in the code without classifying the building or use as a Group H oc-
cupancy, provided that the materials are displayed and stored in
accordance with the International Fire Code and quantities do not exceed
the maximum in this code.

In Group M occupancy wholesale and retail sales uses, indoor storage of
flammable and combustible liquids must not exceed the maximum allow-
able quantities per control area as indicated in this code. 

The maximum quantity of aerosol products in Group M occupancy retail
display areas and retail storage areas must be in accordance with the Inter-
national Fire Code.

Ventilation of any rooms, areas, or spaces of Group H in which explosive,
corrosive, combustible, flammable, or highly toxic dusts, mists, fumes, va-
pors, or gases are or may be emitted due to the processing, use, handling,
or storage of materials must be mechanically ventilated as required of the
International Fire and International Mechanical Codes. 

Supply and exhaust openings must be located in accordance with the In-
ternational Mechanical Code and exhaust air that is contaminated by
highly toxic material must be treated in accordance with the International
Fire Code. A manual shutoff control for ventilation equipment required by
this section must be provided outside the room adjacent to the main access
door to the room. The switch must be breakable and will be labeled: Ven-
tilation System Emergency Shutoff.

If a building or structure has systems involving hazardous materials, the
systems must be suitable for the intended applications. These systems are
not interchangeable, they are designed to meet the individual designs and
should not be changed around to suit your needs. It is your responsibility
to obtain the proper systems for your needs. Controls must be designed to
prevent materials from entering or leaving process or reaction systems at
other than the intended time, rate, or path. Automatic controls, where pro-

Walls must not obstruct more than one side of the structure unless the ob-
structed area does not exceed 25 percent of the structure’s perimeter. The
distance from the structure to buildings, lot lines, pubic ways, or means of
exits cannot be less than the distance required for an outside hazardous
material storage or use area without weather protection. The overhead
structure must be of approved noncombustible construction with a maxi-
mum area of 1500 square feet. 

Storage

An approved manual emergency system must be provided in buildings,
rooms, or areas used for storage of hazardous materials. Emergency alarm-
initiating devices will be installed outside of each interior exit or exit access
door of storage buildings, rooms, or areas. The activation of an alarm-ini-
tiating device must sound a local alarm to alert occupants of an emergency
situation involving hazardous materials.

Hazardous Materials with Rankings of 3 or 4

Where hazardous materials having a hazard ranking of 3 or 4 in accordance
with NFPA 704 are transported through corridors or exit enclosures, there
must be an emergency telephone system, a local manual alarm station, or
an approved alarm-initiating device at not more than 150-foot intervals
and at each exit and exit access doorway throughout the transport route.
The signal must be relayed to an approved central, proprietary, or remote

ides, unclassified detonable, and unstable reactive materials of class III and
IV that are detonable and detonable pyrophoric materials, floors in storage
areas for these materials must be of liquid-tight noncombustible construc-
tion. Group H-2 cannot be less than 30 feet where the area of the occu-
pancy exceeds 1000 square feet and it is not required to be located in a de-
tached building. Groups H-2 and H-3 cannot be less than 50 feet where a
detached building is required. 

Occupancies in these two groups containing materials with explosive char-
acteristics must be separated as required by the International Fire Code. 

In Groups H-1, H-2, or H-3 where detached buildings are required by
Table 4.11 there are no requirements for wall and opening protection
based on fire separation distance. There are special provisions for Group
H-1 occupancies that you must follow. 

Group H-1 occupancies must be in buildings used for no other purpose,
cannot exceed one story in height, or be without a basement, crawl spaces,
or other under-floor spaces. Roofs must be of lightweight construction
with suitable thermal insulation to prevent sensitive material from reach-

materials which are in both physical and health hazards in quantities ex-
ceeding the maximum allowable quantities per control area must comply
with requirements for both H-1 and H-4 occupancies. 

Special provisions for Group H-2 and H-3 occupancies containing quanti-
ties of hazardous materials must be in buildings used for no other purpose
and cannot be more than one story or without a basement or crawl space.
If these occupancies contain water-reactive materials they must be resist-

tween attached structures that are occupied for LP-gas are permitted to
have fire door assemblies. These barriers must be designed to withstand a
static pressure of at least 100 pounds per square foot (psf), except where the
building to which the structure is attached is occupied by operations or
processes with similar hazards. 

Where liquefied petroleum gas-distribution facilities are located in rooms
within buildings, these rooms must be located in the first story level above
grade plane, they must also have at least one outside wall with enough ex-
posed area to provide explosion venting. The walls, floors, ceilings, and
roofs of such rooms and building must be constructed of approved non-
combustible materials, and must be fire barriers with no less than a one-
hour fire-resistance rating and without openings. Walls that are used for
storing LP-gas are allowed to have openings that comply with code require-
ments, and they must be designed to withstand a static pressure of at least
100 psf. 

Group H-5

Fabrication of Group H-5 that has aggregate quantities of hazardous ma-
terials stored and used in a single fabrication must not exceed the amount
allowed by this code.

Fabrication areas, whose sizes are limited, must be separated from each
other, from corridors, and other parts of the building with one-hour fire
barriers, except doors within having a fire protection of not less than ¾
hour. Or, windows between areas and corridors are permitted to be fixed

glazing of at least ¾ hour. Occupied levels of areas must be located at or
above the first story above grade plane. All floors except for surfacing must
be of noncombustible materials. Any shafts, vent shafts, and other open-
ings must be enclosed. The annular space around penetrations for cables,
cable trays, tubing, piping, or ducts must be sealed at the floor level to re-
strict the movement of air. 

A ventilation system must be in place to capture and exhaust gases, fumes,
and vapors at workstations. Exhaust ducts that penetrate workstations
must be contained in a shaft. HPM must be transported to fabrication ar-
eas through enclosed piping that comply with this chapter and the Inter-
national Fire Code.

All electrical equipment used within the fabrication area must conform to
the ICC Electrical Code. If the average air change is at least four times an
hour and is not less than three times then the location of hazardous mate-
rials does not apply to fabrication. 

You may not energize workstations without proper exhaust ventilation. All
corridors must be separated from fabrication areas as specified in this
chapter. Corridors cannot contain HPM and cannot be used for transport-
ing these materials, except through closed piping systems or unless fabri-
cation areas are altered or modified, subject to the following conditions.

Corridors adjacent to the fabrication area where the alteration work is to
be done must comply with the code for a length determined as follows: the
length of the common wall of the corridor and the fabrication area and the
distance along the corridor to the point of entry of HPM into the corridor
serving that fabrication area. Also, there must be an emergency telephone
system, a local manual alarm station, or another approved alarm-initiating
device within the corridors at no more than 150-foot intervals. Or, self-
closing doors having a fire protection rating of not less than one hour.

Service corridors are of a different nature and the coding for them is some-
what different. They are classified as Group H-5 and service corridors are to
be kept separate from corridors as previously discussed in this chapters.
Service corridors cannot be used as a required corridor and they must be me-
chanically vented or at no less than six air changes per hour. Service corri-
dors are required to have a means of exit as well as any corridor. The maxi-
mum distance of travel from any point to a service corridor is not to exceed
75 feet. Dead ends cannot exceed 4 feet. There may not be less than two ex-
its and no more than one-half can require travel into a fabrication area. 

Service corridors must have doors that swing in the direction of the exit.
The doors must have a minimum width of 5 feet or 33 inches wider than
the widest cart or truck used in the corridor, whichever is greatest. As with
required corridors, all service corridors are required to have an emergency
alarm system in place.

Storage of hazardous production materials must be within approved or
listed storage cabinets or gas cabinets within a workstation. Any HPM in
quantities greater than those listed in Section 1804.2 of the International
Fire Code must be in liquid storage rooms. The construction of HPM and
gas rooms must be separated from other areas and by not less than a two-
hour fire barrier in an area that is 300 square feet. Liquid storage rooms
must be constructed in accordance with the following:

䡲 Rooms in excess of 500 square feet must have at least one outer
door approved for fire department access.
䡲 Rooms must be separated from other areas by fire barriers hav-
ing a fire-resistance rating of not less than one hour for rooms
up to 150 square feet in area.
䡲 Shelving, racks, and wainscoting in these areas must be of non-
combustible construction or wood of not less than 1 inch (25
mm) normal thickness.

Rooms used for the storage of Class I flammable liquids must not be 
located in the basement.

Liquid storage rooms and gas rooms must have a least one outside wall that
will be no less than 30 feet from lot lines adjacent to public ways. Explosion
control is required. Where two exits are required, one must lead directly

CHAPTER 2

outside of the building. Mechanical exhaust ventilation must be provided
in liquid storage rooms at the rate of no less than 1 cubic foot per minute
of floor area or six air changes per hour. HPM storage is required to have
an approved emergency alarm system that is alarm-initiating and sounds a
local alarm and transmits a signal to the emergency control station.

Piping and tubing is required of systems that supply HPM liquids or gases
having a health-hazard rating of III or IV and must be welded throughout,
except for connections to the system that are within a ventilated enclosure.
Hazardous production materials supply piping in service must be readily
accessible. Where HPM gases or liquids are carried in pressurized piping
above 15 pounds per square inch gauge (psig), excess flow control shall be
provided. Where the piping comes from within a liquid storage room,
HPM room, or gas room, the excess flow control shall be located within the
liquid storage room, HPM room, or gas room. The installation of HPM
piping and tubing within the space shall be in accordance with the follow-
ing conditions:

䡲 Automatic sprinklers must be installed within the space unless
the space is less than 6 inches in the least dimensions.
䡲 Ventilation not less than six air changes per hour must be provided. 
䡲 The space must not be used to convey air from any other area.
䡲 Where the piping or tubing is used to transport HPM liquids,
a receptor must be installed below such piping or tubing. 
䡲 The receptor must be designed to collect any discharge or leak-
age and drain it to an approved location. 
䡲 The one-hour enclosure must not be used as part of the receptor.
䡲 HPM supply piping and tubing and nonmetallic waste line
must be separated from the corridor and from occupancies
other than group H-5 by fire barriers that have a fire-resistance
rating of not less than one hour. 
䡲 Where gypsum wallboard is used, joints on the piping side of
the enclosure are not required to be taped, provided the joints
occur over framing members.
䡲 Access openings into the enclosure must be protected by ap-
proved fire protection-rated assemblies.

SPECIAL DETAILED REQUIREMENTS BASED ON USE AND OCCUPANCY

59

䡲 Readily accessible manual or automatic remotely activate fail-
safe emergency shutoff valves must be installed on piping and
tubing other than waste lines at the following locations: (1) at
branch locations into the fabrication area (2) at entries into
corridors. The exception to this is any transverse crossing of
the corridors by supply piping that is enclosed within a ferrous
pipe or tube for the width of the corridor need not comply
with bullets one through five.

Gas Detection

Continuous gas detection systems must be provided for HPM gases when
the physiological warning threshold level of the gas is at a higher level than
the accepted PEL for the gas and for flammable gases in accordance with
this section. A continuous gas-detection system is required for fabrication
areas, HPM rooms, gas cabinets, and exhausted enclosures and corridors,
but is not required for the occasional transverse crossing of the corridors
by supply piping that is enclosed in a ferrous pipe or tube for the width of
the corridor. The gas-detection system must be capable of monitoring the
room, and/or equipment, in which the gas is located at or below the PEL
or ceiling limit of the gas. For flammable gases, the monitoring detection
threshold level shall be vapor concentrations in excess of 20 percent of the
lower explosive limit (LEL). Monitoring for highly toxic gases must also
comply with the requirements of the International Fire Code.

Gas detection systems must initiate a local arm and transmit a signal to the
emergency control station when a short-term hazard is detected. The gas
detection system must automatically close the shutoff valve at the source
on gas supply piping and tubing related to the system being monitored for
which gas is detected when a short-term hazard is detected. Automatic clo-
sure of shutoff valves must comply with the following:

䡲 Where the gas-detection sampling point initiating the gas de-
tection system alarm is within a gas cabinet or exhausted en-
closure, the shutoff valve in the gas cabinet or exhausted enclo-
sure for the specific gas detected shall automatically close.
䡲 Where the gas-detection sampling point initiating the gas de-
tection system alarm is within a room and compressed gas

60

CHAPTER 2

containers are not in gas cabinets or an exhausted enclose, the
shutoff valves on all gas lines for the specific gas detected shall
automatically close.
䡲 Where the gas-detection sampling point initiating the gas de-
tection system alarm is within a piping distribution manifold
enclosure, the shutoff valve supplying the manifold for the
compressed gas container of the specific gas detected must au-
tomatically close.

The only exception to this is where the gas-detection sampling point initi-
ating the gas detection system alarm is at the use location or within a gas
valve enclosure of a branch line downstream of a piping distribution man-
ifold; the shutoff valve for the branch line location in the distribution man-
ifold enclosure must automatically close. The emergency control station
must receive signals form emergency equipment and alarm and detection
systems. Such emergency equipment and alarm and detection systems
must include, but are not be limited to, the following where such equip-
ment or systems are required to be provided, either in this chapter or else-
where in this code:

䡲 Automatic fire sprinkler system alarm and monitoring systems

䡲 Manual fire alarm systems

䡲 Emergency alarm systems

䡲 Continuous gas-detection systems

Exhaust Ventilation

Exhaust ventilation systems are allowed to be designed to operate at no less
than one-half the normal fan speed of the emergency power system where
it is demonstrated that the level of exhaust will maintain a safe atmosphere.
Automatic sprinkler system protection in exhaust ducts for HPM must be
provided in exhaust ducts conveying gases, vapors, fumes, mists, or dusts
generated for HPM. This applies to metallic and noncombustible non-
metallic exhaust ducts where the largest cross-sectional diameter is equal
to or greater than 10 inches and the ducts are within the building and they
convey flammable gases, vapors, or fumes, except for ducts listed or ap-
proved for applications without automatic fire sprinkler system protection
or ducts not more than 12 feet in length installed below ceiling level.

Now, let’s move into Chapter 3 to explore more of the mysteries of the
building code.

CHAPTER

3

General Building Heights and Areas

Welcome to Chapter 3. In this chapter we will explore general building
heights and areas. This chapter includes some definitions that are applied
to this code. The purpose of definitions is to keep you updated on words
that may take on different meanings in the International Building Code
world. I am going to introduce you to a few more groups and their classi-
fications and the codes that these groups must follow.

DEFINITIONS

The following words and definitions applied to this chapter and used in
other places in this code have the meanings as described below:

䡲 Area, building: The area included within surrounding exterior
walls (or exterior walls and fire walls) exclusive of vent shafts
and courts. Areas of the building not provided with surround-
ing walls must be included in the building area if these areas
are included within the horizontal projection of the roof or
floor above.

63

64

CHAPTER 3

䡲 Basement: The portions of buildings that are partly or com-
pletely below grade plane. A basement must be considered as a
story above grade plane where the finished surface of the floor
above the basement is more than 6 feet above grade plane or
more than 12 feet above the finished ground level at any point.
䡲 Equipment platform: An unoccupied, elevated platform used
exclusively for mechanical systems or industrial process equip-
ment, including the associated elevated walkways, stairs, and
ladders necessary to access the platform.
䡲 Grade plane: A reference plane representing the average of fin-
ished ground level adjoining the building at exterior walls.
Where the finished ground level slopes away from the exterior
walls, the reference plane must be established by the lowest
points within the area between the building and the lot line or,
where the lot line is more than 6 feet from the building, be-
tween the building and a point 6 feet from the building.
䡲 Height, building: The vertical distance from grade plane to the
average height of the highest roof surface.
䡲 Height, story: The vertical distance from top to top of two suc-
cessive finished floor surfaces; and, to the topmost story, from
the top of the floor finish to the top of the ceiling joists or,
where there is not a ceiling, to the top of the roof rafters.
䡲 Mezzanine: An intermediate level or levels between the floor
and ceiling of any story and in accordance with this chapter.

GENERAL HEIGHT AND AREA LIMITATIONS

The height and area for buildings of different construction types will be
ruled by the intended use of the building and cannot go over the limits ex-
cept as modified from now on. Each part of a building included within the
inside and outside walls and fire walls, where present, will be allowed to be
a separate building. Buildings and structures that are designed to accom-
modate special industrial processes that require large areas and unusual
heights to contain cranes or special machinery and equipment are exempt
from the height restrictions, such as:

䡲 Rolling mills

GENERAL BUILDING HEIGHTS AND AREAS

65

䡲 Structural metal fabrication shops and foundries
䡲 The production and distribution of electricity
䡲 The production and distribution of gas or steam power.

There are situations when two or more buildings are on the same building
lot. When this happens, they are to be regulated as separate buildings or
they will be considered as parts of one building if the height of each build-
ing and the total area of the buildings are within the limits of Table 4.4 as
modified by this code. The requirements of this code that are valid to the
total building will be appropriate to each building. Buildings that are Type
I construction are allowed to be unlimited level heights and areas are not
required to stick to the special requirements that allow unlimited area
buildings, unlimited height, or increased height and areas for other types
of construction in this chapter.

HEIGHT

The height that is allowed by code will be increased in agreement with this
section with the exception that the height of one-story aircraft hangars, air-
craft paint hangers, and buildings used for the manufacturing of aircraft
will not be limited if the building is provided with an automatic fire-extin-
guishing system and is entirely surrounded by public ways or yards no less
in width than one and one-half times the height of the building.

MEZZANINES

Mezzanines that conform to this section can be considered a portion of the
story. They cannot, however, be counted as either the building area or the
number of stories as regulated by this section. The area of the mezzanine
must be included in determining the fire area. The clear floor height of
your mezzanine cannot be less than 7 feet.

CODE UPDATECODE UPDATE

A basement is a story that is not a story above the grade plane.

66

CHAPTER 3

Trade Tip

Did You Know?

Fast Fact

Height includes roof structures. Towers, steeples, and other roof
structures must be constructed of materials that are consistent with
the required type of construction except where other construction is
allowed by Chapter 15. These structures cannot be used for living
space or storage. If roof structures, such as towers and steeples, are
made of noncombustible materials then their height is unlimited,
but they cannot extend more than 20 feet above the allowable
height if the structure is not made of noncombustible materials.
Chapter 15 has additional information regarding these
requirements.

The total area of a mezzanine within a room is not allowed to be over one-
third of the floor area of the room or the space that they are in. You also
cannot include the enclosed part of the room to determine the floor area
where the mezzanine is located. When determining the allowable mezza-
nine area, the area of the mezzanine cannot be included in the floor area
except for the following:

䡲 The total area of mezzanines in buildings and structures that
are Type I or II for special industrial occupancies in accor-
dance with this chapter cannot be more than two-thirds of the
area in the room.
䡲 The total area of mezzanines in buildings and structures that
are Type I or II cannot be more than one-half of the area of the
room in buildings and structures that have an approved sprin-
kler system throughout. The sprinkler system has to be in ac-
cordance with code requirements and an approved emergency
voice/alarm communication system.

Mezzanines are no different when talking about exits and exit routes. Each
occupant of a mezzanine must have access to at least two exits where the
common path of exit travel is over the limits of Chapter 10. If the exit from
your mezzanine is a stairway, the maximum travel distance must include the
distance traveled on the stairway measured in the plane of the tread nosing. 

GENERAL BUILDING HEIGHTS AND AREAS

67

Accessible means of exits must be provided, as well as a single means of
exit. If a building or structure has a mezzanine it has to be open and no ob-
structions are allowed in the room where the mezzanine is located, except
for walls that are not more than 42 inches high, columns, and posts.

There are five exceptions to this code, and they are as follows:

䡲 Mezzanines or portions that are of concern are not required to
be open, provided that the occupant load does not go over 10
persons.
䡲 Mezzanines or portions that are of concern are not required to
be open to the room if at least one of the exits provides direct
access to an exit from the mezzanine level.
䡲 Mezzanines are not required to be open to the room, provided
that the total floor area of the enclosed space does not go over
10 percent of the area.
䡲 In industrial facilities, mezzanines used for control equipment
are allowed to be glazed on all sides.
䡲 In Groups H and I occupancies that are no more than two stories
in height above grade plane and equipped with an automatic
sprinkler, a mezzanine having two or more exits is not required to
be open to the room in which the mezzanine is located.

EQUIPMENT PLATFORMS

Equipment platforms in buildings cannot be considered as a portion of the
floor below and must not contribute to either the building area or the
number of stories as regulated by this chapter. You may also not use the
area of the equipment platform to determine the fire area. Equipment plat-
forms cannot be part of any mezzanine and these platforms and walkways,
stairs, and ladders that provide access to an equipment platform cannot be
used as an exit from the building either. There are some area limitations
that you must be aware of. 

The total area of all equipment platforms within a room cannot be larger
than two-thirds of the area of the room which they are in. If the equipment
platform is located in the same room as a mezzanine, the area of the mez-
zanine must be determined by this chapter and the combined total area of

68

CHAPTER 3

the equipment platforms and mezzanines cannot be more than two-thirds
of the room that they are in. If a mezzanine is in a building that is required
to have an automatic sprinkler system, equipment platforms must be fully
protected by these sprinklers above and below the platform.

AREA MODIFICATIONS

You know that this code limits the areas that are permitted to be increased
with the proper automatic sprinkler system in place. There is an equation that
must be applied when increasing these areas in accordance with Equation 3.1.
Aa = {At ⫹ {A1 ⫻ If} ⫹ [A1 ⫻ Is]}                  (Eq. 3.1)

Aa = Allowable area per story in square feet.

At = Tabular area per story in accordance with Table 4.4 in square feet.

If = Area increase factor due to frontage as calculated 
in accordance with this chapter.

Is = Area increase factor due to sprinkler system protection 
as calculated in accordance with this chapter.

A single basement that is not a story above plane does need to be included
in the total allowable area if it is not bigger than the area that is allowed for
a building with no more than one story above grade plane.

Each building must connect or have access to a public way to receive an area in-
crease for frontage. Where a building has more than 25 percent of its outside on
a public way or open space that has a minimum width of 20 feet, the frontage
increase must be determined in accordance with Equation 3.2.
If = [F/P ⫺ 0.25] W/30                             (Eq. 3.2)

If = Area increase due to frontage.

F = Building perimeter that fronts on a public way or open 
space having 20 feet open minimum width.

P = Perimeter of entire building in feet.

W = Width of public way or open space (feet) in accordance 
with this chapter.

GENERAL BUILDING HEIGHTS AND AREAS

69

Width must be at least 20 feet. Where the value of width varies along the
perimeter of the building, the calculation performed in accordance with
Equation 5.1 must be based on the weighted average of each part of the ex-
terior wall and open space where the value of “W” is greater than or equal
to 20 feet. When “W” is more than 30 feet, a value of 30 feet must be used
in calculating the weighted average, regardless of the actual width of the
open space. The exception being that the quantity of “W” divided by 30
must be permitted to be a maximum of two when the building meets all re-
quirements of this chapter except for compliance with the 60-foot public
way or yard requirement, if applicable. These open spaces must be either
on the same lot or dedicated for public use and must be accessed from a
street or approved fire lane.

If a building is equipped with an approved automatic sprinkler throughout
the building, the area is allowed to be increased by an additional 200 per-
cent (Is = 2) for buildings with more than one story above grade plane and
an additional 300 percent (Is = 3) for buildings with no more than one
story above grade plane. These increases are permitted in addition to the
height and story increases. The following list contains exceptions that must
be made to this:

䡲 The automatic sprinkler system increase cannot apply to
buildings with an occupancy in Group H-1.
䡲 The automatic sprinkler system increase must not apply to the
floor area of occupancy in Group H-2 or H-3. For mixed-use
buildings containing these occupancies, the allowable area
must be calculated in accordance with this book, with the
sprinkler increase applying only to the portions of the build-
ings not classified as Group H-2 or H-3.

CODE UPDATECODE UPDATE

Two or more buildings on the same lot shall be regulated as
separate buildings or shall be considered as portions of one
building, if the building height of each building and the aggregate
building area of the buildings are within code limitations.

70

CHAPTER 3

䡲 Fire-resistance rating substitution in accordance with code 
allowances.

The maximum area of a building with more than one story above grade
plane must be determined by multiplying the allowable area of the first
story (Aa), as determined in the above section, by the number of stories
above grade plane as listed below:

䡲 For buildings with three or more stories above grade plane,
multiply by three.
䡲 For buildings with two stories above grade plane, multiply by two.
䡲 No story can be larger than the allowable area per story (Aa), as de-
termined in the above section, for the occupancies on that story.

Unlimited area buildings in accordance with this chapter and the maxi-
mum area of the building equipped throughout with an automatic sprin-
kler system determined by multiplying the allowable area per story (Aa), as
determined in this chapter, by the number of stories above grade plane are
two exceptions to area determination. 

In buildings with mixed occupancies, the allowable area must be based on
the most restrictive provision for each occupancy when the mixed occu-
pancies are treated in accordance with this chapter. When the occupancies
are treated according to this chapter, as separate occupancies, the maxi-
mum total building area must be the ratios for each area on all floors as cal-
culated according to this chapter and not go over two for two-story build-
ings and three for buildings three stories or higher.

UNLIMITED AREA BUILDINGS

The area of buildings and occupancies and configurations of this section
will not be limited. The area of a one-story, non-sprinkler Group F-2 or 
S-2 building must not be limited when the building is surrounded and at-
tached by public ways or yards not less than 60 feet in width. If the area of
a one-story, Group B, F, M, or S building or a one-story Group A-4 build-
ing, of other than Type V construction, must not be limited when the
building is equipped with an automatic sprinkler system throughout, pro-
vided it is in accordance with code requirements and it must be sur-

䡲 Buildings and structures of Type I and II construction for rack
storage facilities that do not have access by the public must not
be limited in height, provided that these buildings conform to
the requirements of this code and to NFPA 230.
䡲 The automatic sprinkler system is not required to be in an area
occupied for indoor participant sports, such as tennis, skating,
swimming, and equestrian activities in occupancies in Group-A,

all required exits lead directly outdoors.

If a two-story building that is Group B, F, M, or S, and is equipped with an
automatic sprinkler system, the area will not be limited. It must, however,
be surrounded and adjoined by public ways or yards no less than 60 feet in
width. The permanent open space of 60 feet required in this chapter will be
permitted to be reduced to no less than 40 feet, if the following require-
ments are met:

䡲 The reduced open space is not allowed for more than 75 per-
cent of the perimeter of the building.

specified in the code as modified by this chapter that are based upon the
percentage of the perimeter of each Group H fire area that looks onto on a
street or other unoccupied space. Also, the total floor area of Group H oc-
cupancies not located at the outside of the building cannot be more than
25 percent of the area limitations for the Group H occupancies. For two-
story unlimited area buildings, the Group H fire areas cannot be located
above the first story unless permitted by the allowable height in stories and
feet as described in this code based on the type of construction of the un-
limited area building. 

Group E buildings of Type II, IIIA, or IV construction will not be limited
when the following criteria are met:

䡲 Each classroom must have no less than two means of exits,
with one of those exits being a direct exit to the outside of the
building.
䡲 The building is equipped throughout with an automatic sprin-
kler system.
䡲 The building is surrounded by and joined by public ways or
yards no less than 60 feet (18,288 mm) in width.

MIXED USE AND OCCUPANCY

Buildings or parts of buildings that contain two or more occupancies or
uses are classified as mixed use. This section applies to mixed use occu-
pancy and the buildings that they occupy. The first subject of this section
cover incidental uses that must comply with this section, the only excep-

CODE UPDATECODE UPDATE

With some exceptions, no separation is required between accessory
occupancies and the main occupancy.

tions are incidental use areas that serve as a dwelling or living space that do
not have to comply with this section. An incidental use area must be clas-
sified in accordance with the occupancy of that portion of the building in
which it is located or the building must be classified as a mixed occupancy
and will comply with this section.

Where the code allows an automatic fire-extinguishing system without a
fire barrier, the incidental use area must be separated from the rest of the
building by construction that is capable of resisting smoke from passing
through the building. The partitions must extend from the floor to the un-
derneath of the fire-resistance-rated floor/ceiling assembly or fire-resist-
ance-rated roof/ceiling assembly above or to the bottom of the floor or
roof sheathing or sub deck above. Doors must be self-closing or automatic
closing when the detection of smoke is made. Doors also must not have any
air transfer openings and cannot be undercut in excess of the clearance that
is permitted in accordance of NFPA 80.

Where an automatic fire-extinguishing system or automatic sprinkler sys-
tem is provided, only the incidental use areas need to be equipped with this
system.

We are now ready to investigate Chapter 4 to learn more of the meat of the
code.

FIRE-RESISTANCE RATING AND FIRE TESTS

The materials that I describe in this chapter for fire resistance will conform
to the requirements of this chapter in your code book. The fire-resistance
rating of building elements is determined in accordance with test proce-

dures that are made by ASTM E 119 or in accordance with your local code.
If you have materials, systems, or devices that have not been tested as part
of a fire-resistance-rated assembly, but are incorporated into the assembly,
you must show sufficient data or information to the building official that
the required fire-resistance rating is not reduced. All of the building mate-
rials and methods used in your construction that produce joints and pen-
etration in fire-resistance-rated buildings cannot reduce the required fire-
resistance rating except for one condition. When you are determining the
fire-resistance rating of outside walls, compliance with the ASTM E 119
data for unexposed surface temperature rise and ignition of cotton waste,
because of flame or gases, is only required for the time period that corre-
sponds to the required fire-resistance rating of an outside nonbearing wall
that has the same fire separation distance, and must be in a building of the
same group.

If inside walls of a building or structure are not proportioned or even, then
they have to be tested with both faces of the walls exposed to the furnace
and the assigned fire-resistance rating has to be the shortest duration that
you get from the two tests that you conduct in agreement with ASTM E
119. If your evidence is given to the building official and shows that the wall
was tested with the least fire-resistant side exposed to the furnace, it is the
code officer’s discretion for approval. 

Combustible components such as aggregates are permitted in gypsum and
cement concrete mixtures approved for fire-resistance-rated construction.
Any approved element or admixture (the product of two substances mixed
together) is allowed in assemblies if the tested assembly meets the fire-re-
sistance test requirements. These assemblies that are tested under the

ASTM E 119 cannot be considered restrained unless the evidence that you
present is in accordance with ASTM E 119 approved by the building offi-
cial. The following methods are alternatives for determining fire-resistance
rating, but as I said, they must conform to ASTM E 119 and be approved
by your building official.

䡲 Fire-resistance designs documented in approved sources
䡲 Prescriptive designs of fire-resistance-rated building elements
as approved in this chapter
䡲 Calculations in accordance with this chapter
䡲 Engineering analysis based on comparing building element de-
signs that have fire-resistance ratings determined by ASTM E
119.

There are two types of materials—elementary and composite materials—
that are noncombustible; these do not conform to ASTM E 119. Elementary
materials that are required to be noncombustible must be tested in accor-
dance with ASTM E 136 and composite materials that have a structural base
of noncombustible materials with a surfacing of no more than 0.125 inch
thick that have a flame spread index of no more than 50 when tested in ac-
cordance with ASTM E 84 will be acceptable as noncombustible materials.

EXTERIOR WALLS

Exterior walls are walls, bearing or nonbearing, used as an enclosing wall,
but cannot be a fire wall and have a slope of 60 degrees or greater with the
horizontal plane. This section will include moldings, eave overhangs, out-
side balconies, and similar projections that extend beyond the floor area

Projections from walls that are Type III, IV, or V construction can be
of any approved material. With the exception of Type V
construction, which is allowed for R-3 occupancies, all combustible
projections that are located where openings are not allowed or
where protection of openings is required must have at least a one-
hour fire-resistance-rated construction.

and must comply with this section. Outside balconies and outside stair-
ways that have exits must comply with the code. There are two methods
that you must put in place to determine the allowable distance that your
walls may jut out. The method that allows for the least amount of distance
will be the one that you must use. These methods are: A point one-third the
distance to the lot line from an assumed vertical plane located where pro-
tected openings are required in accordance with this chapter or more than
12 inches into areas where openings are prohibited. If the building or
structural wall projections are from Type I or Type II construction they
have to be made of materials that are noncombustible or combustible as al-
lowed by code exceptions. 

OUTSIDE WALLS

Outside walls have protected and unprotected openings. These openings
are required to be vertically separated so that they are protected against fire
spread on the outside of the buildings if the openings are within 5 feet of
each other horizontally, and the opening in the lower story is not a pro-
tected opening with a fire protection rating of no less than ¾ hour. But,
you must also have the openings vertically separated at least 3 feet by span-
drel girders or outside walls that have a one hour fire-resistance-rating. If
not, you have to install flame barriers that extend at least 30 inches hori-
zontally beyond the outside wall. Please note that whether you choose
spandrel girders or flame barriers, a one hour fire-resistance rating is re-
quired. Exceptions to this are as follows:

䡲 This section does not apply to buildings that are three stories
or less in height.
䡲 This section does not apply to buildings that are fully equipped
with an automatic sprinkler system, but it must be throughout
the whole building.
䡲 This section does not apply to parking garages.

For buildings that are located on the same lot, opening protectives that
have a fire-protection rating that is less than ¾ hour must be in every open-
ing that is less than 15 feet vertically above the roof of the building that is
next to it within 15 feet of the wall where the opening is located. But if the
roof construction has a fire-resistance rating no less than one hour with a
minimum distance less than 10 feet then you can disregard the above. The
International Building Code requires that all outside walls include para-
pets, which are walls placed at the edge of a roof. There are certain condi-
tions in which a parapet does not need to be added to an outside wall:

䡲 The wall is not required to be fire-resistance-rated because of
fire separation distance.
䡲 The building’s area is not more than 1000 square feet on any floor.
䡲 Walls that end at roofs that are less than two-hour fire-resist-
ance construction or if the roof, this includes the deck and sup-
ports, is made entirely of noncombustible materials.
䡲 One-hour fire-resistance walls that end at the underside of the
roof, deck, or slab, if the following needs are met:
– Roof and ceiling frames cannot be less than one-hour fire-
resistance with a width of 4 feet for Groups R and U and 10
feet for all other occupancies.
– Roof and ceiling elements that are not parallel to the wall,
the entire span of framing and supports cannot be less than
one-hour fire-resistance construction.
– Openings in the roof cannot be located within 5 feet of any
one-hour fire-resistant outside wall for Groups R and U and
10 feet for all other occupancies.
– The entire building must be provided with a roof covering
that is no less than Class B.

80

CHAPTER 4

䡲 Groups R-2 and R-3 that are covered with a Class C roof cov-
ering must have outside walls that end at the underside of the
roof sheathing in Type III, IV, and V construction provided
that the following conditions are met:
– The roof or deck is constructed of noncombustible materi-
als that are approved or made of fire-retardant wood with a
distance of 4 feet.
– The roof is protected with 0.625-inch Type X gypsum board
directly beneath the roof or deck. The supports of the roof
must have a minimum of 2-inch ledgers attached to the
sides of the roof framing with a distance of 4 feet.
– The wall is allowed to have at least 25 percent of the outside
walls containing unprotected openings.

PARAPET CONSTRUCTION

Parapets must have the same fire-resistant rating as other construction of
any outside wall. They also must be noncombustible from 18 inches from
the top downward (this includes counterflashing and coping materials).
The code also requires that the parapet is not less than 30 inches above the
point of the roof and wall intersection. And, the parapet must extend to the
same height of the roof within fire separation distance, but in no case
should the height be more than 30 inches. With any rule or code in the In-
ternational Code Book, if you have any questions, please consult a build-
ing official.

CODE UPDATECODE UPDATE

Fireblocking consists of materials installed to resist the free passage
of flame to other areas of the building through concealed spaces.

FIRE WALLS

Each portion of a building that is separated by one or more fire walls must
be considered as a separate building. The extent and the location of the fire
walls have to provide a complete separation. Wherever a fire wall separates
occupancies you must follow the strictest requirements. This includes any
wall located on a lot line between buildings that are adjacent to each other or
is adapted for joint service, and must be constructed as a fire wall. Fire walls
have to be constructed with the same fire conditions as the rest of the build-
ing in regards to duration of time. All fire walls, with the exception of Type
V construction, have to be made of approved noncombustible materials.

Fire walls must be continuous from outside to inside walls and must ex-
tend at least 18 inches beyond the outside surface walls. Exceptions to this
rule are found below:

䡲 Fire walls are permitted to end at the inside surface of com-
bustible outside siding provided that the outside walls have a
fire-resistance rating of at least one hour for a horizontal dis-
tance of at least 4 feet on both sides of the fire wall. Any open-
ings with outside walls have to be protected by opening protec-
tives that have a rating not less than ¾ hour.
䡲 Fire walls are permitted to end at the inside surface of a non-
combustible outside casing where the buildings on each side of
the fire wall are protected by an automatic sprinkler system.

Exterior or outside walls, at the point of intersection, must have, on both
sides, a one-hour fire rating with ¾ hour opening protection. The rating
must extend a minimum of 4 feet on each side starting from the intersec-
tion to the outside all. If such walls form an angle equal to or greater than

180 degrees they do not need outside wall protection. Fire walls must ex-
tend to the outer edge of horizontal projections such as balconies, roof
overhangs, canopies, and other similar projects that are within 4 feet of the
fire wall. There are a few exceptions in regards to these projections that I
will explain in the following list:

䡲 Horizontal projections without concealed spaces, provided
that the outside wall behind and below the projection has no
less than a one-hour fire rating for a distance that is not less
than the depth of the projection on either side of the fire wall.
These openings with outside walls have to be protected by
openings with a fire protection rating of ¾ hour; nothing less.
䡲 Noncombustible horizontal projections with concealed spaces
providing a minimum one-hour rated construction, extending
through the concealed space. The wall is not required to extend
under the projection and the openings within the outside walls
must be protected by opening protectives that have a fire rat-
ing of ¾ hour; nothing less.
䡲 For combustible horizontal projections with concealed spaces,
the fire wall only needs to extend through the concealed space
to the outer edges of the projections, and again, a one hour fire
rating of ¾ hour is required.

Fire walls must have vertical continuity, meaning fire walls have to extend from
the foundation to an ending point at least 30 inches above both adjacent roofs.
However, two hour fire-rated walls will be permitted to end at the underside of
the roof, deck, or slab if the lower roof within 4 feet of the wall has a one-hour
fire rating, openings in the roof are not located within 4 feet of the fire wall, and
each building has no less than a Class B roof covering.

end at a point no less than 30 inches above the lower roof level and
the outside wall has to be at least 15 feet above the lower roof.
These must have a one-hour fire rating construction from both sides
of the openings protected by fire assemblies which must be
protected by no less than a ¾ hour rating.

Walls will be permitted to end at the underside of noncombustible roofs,
decks, or slabs provided that both buildings have no less than a Class B roof
covering. In buildings of Type III, IV, and V construction, walls are 
allowed to end at the underside of the roof or deck if there are no openings
in the roof within 4 feet of the fire wall, the roof is covered with a minimum
Class B roof covering, and the roof is constructed of fire-retardant treated
wood with a distance of 4 feet on both sides of the wall or the roof is pro-
tected with Type X gypsum that is 5/8 inch thick. If the building is located
above a parking garage it will be allowed to have fire walls for the buildings
located above the garage from the horizontal separation between the park-
ing garage and the buildings. 

If a fire wall ends at the base of a roof, the lower roof within 10 feet of the
wall has no less than a one-hour fire rating, and the entire length and span
of the supports for the roof assembly cannot have a rating of less than one-
hour. The lower roof cannot have openings that are located within 10 feet
of the fire wall. 

Each opening through a fire wall must not be more than 120 square feet,
unless both buildings have an automatic sprinkler system throughout. The
total width of openings at any floor level cannot be over 25 percent of the
length of the wall and openings are not allowed in party walls. Penetrations
of fire walls and joints made in or between fire walls must comply with this
chapter, and remember; ducts and air transfer openings cannot penetrate
fire walls unless they are not on a lot line and comply with this chapter. 

84

CHAPTER 4

FIRE BARRIERS

Fire barriers must be made of materials that are permitted by the building
type of construction and fire-resistance-rated glazing, when tested in ac-
cordance with ASTM E 119 shall comply with this section. They have to be
labeled or show some type of identification, provided by an approved
agency that has the name of the manufacturer, the test standard and the
identifier that includes the fire-resistance rating. Exit enclosures, exit pas-
sageways, to include horizontal exits, all must comply with the code book. 

When outside walls are part of a required fire-rated shaft or exit enclosure
they have to be in accordance with the code. Fire barriers must extend from
the top of the floor/ceiling assembly below to the bottom of the floor or
roof slab or deck above and be securely attached. 

Fire barriers must also be continuous through concealed spaces, such as
the space above a suspended ceiling. All supporting construction must be
protected to allow the required fire rating of the fire barrier supports. Hol-
low vertical spaces within a fire barrier must be fire blocked at every floor
level except that shaft enclosures are allowed to end at a top enclosure
when complying with this section. 

All outside walls that are used as a part of a required fire-rating enclosure
or separation have to comply with this section except for outside walls that
are in accordance with code exceptions. Openings in a fire barrier will be
protected and will be limited to a maximum aggregate width of 25 percent
of the length of the wall having a maximum area of any single opening not
being more than 156 square feet. This does apply to openings that have ad-

SMOKE BARRIERS

All smoke barriers are required to have a one-hour fire-resistance rating
with the exception of smoke barriers that are a minimum of 0.10-inch-
thick steel in Group I-3 buildings. Smoke barriers must form an effective
casing that is continuous from outside wall to outside wall and from the
top of the foundation or floor/ceiling assembly below to the bottom of the
floor or roof above. This is to include the connection through concealed
spaces, such as those found above suspended ceilings and mechanical
spaces. Any supporting construction has to be protected to allow the re-
quired fire-resistance rating of the wall or floor supported in buildings
other than Type IIB, IIIB, or VB construction. Any smoke barrier with
penetrations, joints, and ducts and air transfer openings must comply with
this chapter. 

SMOKE PARTITIONS

Smoke partitions are not required to have a fire-resistance-rating unless re-
quired to do so elsewhere in this book. Smoke partitions extend from the
top of the foundation or floor to the bottom of the roof to limit the transfer
of smoke. All windows and doors, but not to include louvers, must be tested
in accordance with UL 1784 before they are considered to be able to resist
the free passage of smoke. Any free spaces around penetrating items and in
joints must be filled with an approved material to limit the free passage of
smoke. This is also true for ducts and air transfer openings, unless installa-
tion will interfere with the operation of a required smoke control system.

86

CHAPTER 4

HORIZONTAL ASSEMBLIES

A horizontal assembly refers to roofs and floors. Floor and roof assemblies
that are required to have a fire-resistance rating must comply with this sec-
tion. All floor and roof assemblies must be made of materials allowed by
the type of building construction and the fire-resistance rating of floor and
roof assemblies cannot be less than that required by the building type of
construction. But what if you have floor assemblies that separate mixed oc-
cupancies? In cases such as this, the assembly must have a fire-resistance
rating of no less than the minimum required by code, based on the occu-
pancies that are being separated. 

If a floor assembly separates a single occupancy into different fire areas, the
assembly must have a fire-resistance rating of no less than what was dis-
cussed earlier in this chapter. All floor assemblies that separate living
spaces in the same building or sleeping units in occupancies in Group R-1,
hotel occupancies, R-2, and I-1 must be a minimum of one-hour fire-re-
sistance-rated construction. The only exception to this is dwelling and
sleeping units that are used as separation in buildings of Type IIB, IIIB, and
VB construction which must have a fire-resistance rating of no less than ½
hour in buildings that are equipped throughout with an automatic sprin-
kler system. 

Ceiling Panels

Where the weight of lay-in ceiling panels that are used as part of fire-resist-
ance-rated floor/ceiling or roof/ceiling assemblies is not strong enough to
resist an upward force of 1 lb (48 Pa), you must install wire or another ap-
proved device to prevent vertical bowing under such upward force. Access
doors are permitted in ceilings of fire-resistance-rated assemblies provided
that the doors are tested in accordance with ASTM E 119 as horizontal as-

semblies and labeled as such. In one-hour-fire-resistance-rated floor con-
struction and one-hour fire-resistance-rated roof construction, neither the
ceiling covering nor the floor covering is required to be installed where un-
usable crawl space or unusable attic space occurs. All assemblies must be
continuous without openings, penetrations, or joints except where it is al-
lowed elsewhere in this code. 

PENETRATIONS

Where sleeves are used, they must be securely fastened to the assembly that
is penetrated. The space between the item contained in the sleeve and the
sleeve itself and any space between the sleeve and the assembly penetrated
must be protected. Insulation and coverings on or in the penetrating item
must not penetrate the assembly unless the specific material used has been
tested as part of the assembly. 

Penetration into or through fire walls, fire-barrier walls, smoke-barrier
walls, and fire partitions must comply with the following:

䡲 In concrete or masonry walls where the penetrating item is a
maximum of 6-inch nominal diameter and the area of the
opening through the wall is not more than 144 square inches,
concrete, grout, or mortar is allowed where it is installed or the
full thickness required to maintain the fire-resistance rating or
if the material used to fill the annular space will prevent the
passage of flame and hot gases that can ignite cotton waste
when put up against ASTM E 119 time-temperature fire con-
ditions under a minimum positive pressure difference of 0.01
inch of water at the location of the penetration for the time pe-
riod that is equal to the fire-resistance rating of the construc-
tion penetrated. 
䡲 All penetrations must be installed as tested in an approved fire-
resistance rated assembly. 
䡲 Penetrations must be protected by an approved firestop system
installed and tested in accordance with ASTM E 814 or UL
1479, with a minimum positive pressure differential of 0.01
inch of water and must have an F rating of no less than 
required of the fire-resistance rating.

rating, recessed fixtures cannot be installed in a way that will
reduce the required fire resistance, except for the following:
Membrane penetrations of a maximum two-hour fire-resist-
ance-rated wall and partition by steel electrical boxes that are
not more than 16 square inches in area, but only if the total
area of the openings through the membrane is not more than
100 square inches in any 100 square feet of wall area. The 
annular space between the wall membranes and the box can-
not be more than 1/8 inch.

Steel electrical boxes on opposite sides of walls or partitions must be sepa-
rated by one of the following:

䡲 By a horizontal distance of no less than 24 inches 
䡲 By a horizontal distance of not less than the depth of the hole
in the wall where the hole is filled with cellulose loose-fill,
rockwool, or slag mineral wool insulation
䡲 By solid fireblocking

FIRE-RESISTANCE JOINT SYSTEMS

Joints that are installed in or between fire-resistance-rated walls, floors, or
floor/ceiling assemblies, and roofs or roof/ceiling assemblies must be pro-
tected by an approved fire-resistant joint system designed to resist the pas-
sage of fire for a time period that is not less than the required rating. The
void or space created at the intersection of a floor/ceiling assembly and an
outside curtain wall assembly must be protected in accordance with this
section. Fire-resistant joint systems will not be required for joints in all of
the following locations:

䡲 Floors within a single dwelling unit
䡲 Floors where the joint is protected by a shaft enclosure
䡲 Floors within atriums where the space adjacent to the atrium
is included in the volume of the atrium for smoke control
purposes
䡲 Floors within malls
䡲 Floors within open parking structures
䡲 Mezzanine floors
䡲 Walls that are allowed to have unprotected openings
䡲 Roofs where openings are permitted
䡲 Control joints that are not more than a maximum width of 0.625
inch (15.9 mm) and tested in accordance with ASTM E 119.

Fire-resistant joint systems must be securely installed in or on the joint for its
entire length so it will not dislodge, loosen, or otherwise impair its ability to
accommodate expected building movements and to resist the passage of fire
and hot gases. Fire-resistant joint systems must be tested in accordance with
the requirements of either ASTM E 1966 or UL 2079. Non-symmetrical wall
joint systems must be tested with both faces exposed to the furnace, and the
assigned fire-resistance rating must be the shortest time from the two tests.

CHAPTER 4

CODE UPDATECODE UPDATE

A separate fan system shall be used for each elevator hoistway.

When evidence is furnished to show that a wall was tested with the least fire-
resistant side exposed to the furnace, and the building official agrees, then
the wall does not need to be subjected to tests from the opposite side. For
outside walls with a horizontal fire separation distance more than 5 feet, the
joint system must be required to be tested for inside fire exposure only. 

Where fire-resistance-rated floor or floor/ceiling assemblies are required,
empty spaces created at the intersection of the outside curtain wall assem-
blies and such floor assemblies must be sealed with an approved material
or system to prevent fire from spreading around the inside. These materi-
als or systems must be securely installed and be capable of preventing the
passage of flames and hot gases that are hot enough to ignite cotton waste
when subjected either to ASTM E 119 time-temperature fire conditions
under a minimum positive pressure differential of 0.01 inch of water col-
umn or installed as tested in accordance with ASTM E 2307 for the time
period at least equal to the fire-resistance-rating of the floor assembly. 

Height and fire-resistance requirements for curtain wall spandrels must
comply with the section of this chapter that does not require a fire-resist-
ance-rated spandrel wall. Fire-resistant joint systems in smoke barriers
must be tested in accordance with the requirements of UL 2079 for air
leakage. The air leakage rate of the joint must not be more than 5 cfm per
lineal foot of joint at 0.30 inch of water for both the immediate surround-
ing area temperature and elevated temperature tests.

FIRE-RESISTANCE RATING OF STRUCTURAL MEMBERS

The fire-resistance rating of structural members and assemblies must com-
ply with the requirements for the type of construction and cannot be less

ing walls of light-framed construction must be permitted to have required
fire-resistance ratings provided by the covered protection provided for the
load-bearing wall. Where columns need a fire-resistance rating, the entire
column, including its connections to beams or girders, must be protected. 

Where a column extends through a ceiling, fire resistance of the column
must be continuous from the top of the foundation or floor/ceiling assem-
bly below through the ceiling space to the top of the column. The required
thickness and construction of fire-resistance-rated assemblies enclosing
trusses must be based on the results of full-scale tests or combinations of
tests on truss components or on approved calculations based on such tests
that satisfactorily demonstrate that the assembly has the required fire re-
sistance. The edges of lugs, brackets, rivets and bolt heads that are attached
to structural members must be allowed to go over one inch of the surface
of the fire protection. 

The thickness of protection for concrete or masonry reinforcement must
be measured to the outside of the reinforcement except that stirrups and
spiral reinforcement ties are allowed to project no more than 0.5 inch into
the protection. Any and all pipes, wires, conduits, ducts, or other service fa-
cilities must not be embedded in the required fire protective covering of a
structural member that is required to be individually encased. 

Any place where the fire protective covering of a structural member is subject
to impact damage from moving vehicles, the handling of merchandise or other

activity, the fire protective covering must be protected by corner guards or by a
substantial jacket of metal or other noncombustible material to a height that
will provide full protection, but no less than 5 feet from the finished floor. 

Exterior Structural Members

Exterior structural members that are located within the outside walls or on
the outside of a building or structure must be provided with the highest fire-
resistance rating as determined in accordance for the type of building ele-
ment based on the type of construction of the building, for outside bearing
walls and as required for outside walls based on the fire separation distance. 

Fire protection is not required at the bottom flange of lintels, shelf angles,
and plates spanning no more than 6 feet whether part of the structural
frame or not, and from the bottom flange and not part of the structural
frame regardless of span. 

Fire-resistance ratings for the isolation system must meet the fire-resist-
ance rating required for columns, walls, or other structural elements in
which the isolation system is installed in accordance with code require-
ments. Isolation systems that are required to have a fire-resistance rating
must be protected with approved materials or construction assemblies de-
signed to provide the same degree of fire resistance as the structural ele-
ment in which it is installed when tested in accordance with ASTM E 119.
With this isolation protection system applied to isolator units it must be
capable of preventing the transfer of heat to the isolation unit in such a
manner that the required gravity load-carrying capacity of the isolator unit
will not be damaged after exposure to the standard time-temperature
curve fire test as in ASTM E 119 for no less than required for the fire-resist-
ance rating of the structure element of installation. This isolation system

protection applied to isolator units must be correctly designed and se-
curely installed so it does not dislodge, loosen, become damaged, or harm
its ability to accommodate the seismic movements for which it is designed.

OPENING PROTECTIVES

Any opening protectives that are required by other sections of this code
must comply with this section. However, labeled fire-resistance-rated glaz-
ing tested as part of a wall assembly in accordance with ASTM E 119 does
not need to comply with this section. There are alternative methods for de-
termining fire protection ratings, but they must be based on the fire expo-
sure and acceptance criteria specified in NFPA 252 or NFPA 257. The re-
quired fire resistance of an opening protective must be permitted to be
recognized by any of these methods:

䡲 Designs documented in approved sources
䡲 Calculations performed in an approved manner
䡲 Engineering analysis based on a comparison of opening pro-
tective designs having fire-protection ratings as determined by
the test procedures as found in NFPA 252 or 257
䡲 Alternate protection methods.

Doors

I talked earlier about fire doors and shutter assemblies and the fire ratings
for such. These doors do not include side-hinged or pivoted swinging
doors that must be tested as well in accordance with NFPA 252 or UL 10C.

Trade Tip

Did You Know?

Fast Fact

Doors that are in exit enclosures and exit passageways must have a
maximum transmitted temperature end point of no higher than
450° F above the surrounding area at the end of 30 minutes of a
standard fire test exposure, but the maximum transmitted
temperature rise is not limited in buildings equipped throughout
with an automatic sprinkler system.

94

CHAPTER 4

This test requires that after five minutes of testing with the NFPA 252 test,
the neutral pressure level in the furnace must be at 40 inches (1016 mm) or
less above the sill. 

There are other types of doors, such as swinging elevator doors, that also
must be tested in accordance with NFPA 252 or UL 10B. The pressure in the
furnace must be maintained as equal as possible to the atmospheric pres-
sure. Once this is done, the pressure must be maintained during the entire
test period. Fire door assemblies that are required to have a minimum fire
protection rating of 20 minutes where located in corridor walls or smoke-
barrier walls having a fire-resistance rating in accordance with code must be
tested in accordance with NFPA 252 or UL 10C without the hose stream
test. Listed below are three exceptions to this:

䡲 Corridor door assemblies in occupancies of Group I-2 must be
in accordance with code regulations.
䡲 Unprotected openings must be permitted for corridors in
multi-theater complexes where each auditorium has as least
one-half of its required exits or exit access doorways opening
directly to the exterior or into an exit passageway.

Fire door assemblies must meet the requirements for a smoke and draft
control door assembly tested in accordance with UL 1784. Louvers are pro-
hibited. When you are installing smoke doors be sure to follow NFPA 105.
In a 20-minute fire door assembly, the glazing material in the door itself
must have a minimum fire-protection rating of 20 minutes and must be
exempt from the hose stream test. Glazing material in any other part of the
door assembly, including transom lites and sidelites, must be tested in ac-
cordance with NFPA 257, and includes the hose stream test. 

All fire door assemblies, oversized doors, smoke and draft doors must be
labeled by an approved agency and must comply with NFPA 80. I will re-
mind you that these types of labels have to be permanently attached to the
door or the frame. The label must also show the name of the manufacturer,
the name of the inspection agency, the fire rating and, if required, the max-
imum temperature end point. 

Some of you may be using wired glass panels that are found in some fire
doors. The codes for these types of doors differ slightly from the ones I

mentioned above. Glazing other than wired glass in fire windows must be
fire-protection-rated glazing and installed in accordance with NFPA 80. It
must be installed in the fixed position or be automatic-closing.

Fire-protection-rated glazing in fire doors that are located in fire walls are
prohibited except where used as a horizontal exit. A self-closing swinging
door will be permitted to have a vision panel of no more than 100 square
inches without a dimension more than 10 inches and they cannot be in-
stalled in fire doors that have a 1½ -hour fire protection rating intended for
installation in fire barriers, unless the glazing is not more than 100 square
inches in area. 

All approved fire-protection-rated glazing that is used in fire door assem-
blies in elevator and exit enclosures must be located sot that there is a clear
view of the hallway or entry to the elevator, ramp, or stairway. These too
must be labeled as stated above. Fire-protection-rated labels must have one
of the following four-part identification: “D–H,” “NH–T,” or “NT–XXX.”
The list below provides the meaning of each of these.

䡲 “D” indicates that the glazing must be used in fire door assem-
blies and it meets the fire resistance of the test.
䡲 “H” indicates that the glazing meets the hose stream require-
ments of the test standards.
䡲 “NH” indicates that the glazing does not meet the hose stream
requirements.
䡲 “T” indicates that the glazing meets the temperature requirements.

Fast Fact

All fire dampers used for hazardous exhaust duct systems must
comply with the International Mechanical Code. Assemblies with
less than three-hour fire-resistance-rating must have a minimum of
1.5 hour damper rating. And assemblies that have a three or more
hour rating must have a minimum of three hour damper rating. 

96

CHAPTER 4

䡲 “NT” indicates that the glazing does not meet the temperature
requirements.
䡲 “XXX” specifies the fire-protection-rating period, in minutes.

Fire protection rated glazing that is installed in fire doors or fire window
assemblies in hazardous locations must comply with the code. Fire doors
that are located in common walls that separate sleeping areas in Group R-
1 are not required to be automatic or self-closing; always check with your
local building official as this is not the rule for all fire doors, and as a re-
minder, automatic-closing doors must be in accordance with NFPA 80.
Below is a list of all doors that must be automatic closing. Also, unless oth-
erwise permitted, all fire doors, either single or side-hinged swinging
doors, must have a latch bolt that secures the doors when closed. Glazing
in fire window assemblies must comply with the code in regards to fire pro-
tection ratings.

䡲 Doors installed across a corridor
䡲 Doors that protect openings in exits
䡲 Doors that protect openings in walls and are capable of resist-
ing smoke
䡲 Doors installed in smoke barriers

Smoke damper leakage ratings cannot be less than Class II and
Permits are not needed for ordinary repairs to structures,
elevated temperature ratings cannot be less than 250° F. Smoke
replacement of lamps or the connection of approved portable
dampers must close when a smoke detector(s) is activated. In places
where a damper is installed within a duct, a smoke detector must
also be installed within 5 feet of the damper with no air outlets or
inlets in between. If a damper is installed above a smoke barrier
door in a smoke barrier, a spot-type detector listed for releasing
service must be installed on either side of the smoke barrier door
opening. If a damper is installed within an unducted opening in a
wall, a spot-type detector listed for releasing service must be
installed within 5 feet horizontally of the damper.

䡲 Doors installed in the walls for compartmentation of under-
ground buildings
䡲 Doors that are installed in elevator lobby walls of underground
buildings
䡲 Doors that are installed in smoke partitions.

If your building or structure has installed vertical sliding or vertical rolling
steel fire doors for pedestrian use, they must be heat activated or activated
by smoke detectors to ensure the safety of the public. 

FIRE DAMPERS

Ducts and air transfer openings that penetrate fire partitions must be pro-
tected with listed fire dampers. Occupancies other than Group H do not
require a fire partition if the following are met:

䡲 The buildings are tenant separation or corridor walls in build-
ings that are equipped throughout with an automatic sprinkler
system and the duct is protected as a through penetration
䡲 Tenant partitions in covered mall buildings where the walls are
not required by provisions elsewhere in the code to extend to
the bottom of the floor or roof deck above
䡲 The duct system is constructed of approved materials in accor-
dance with the International Mechanical Code and the duct
that penetrates the wall meets the following requirements:
– The duct cannot be more than 100 square inches.
– The duct must be constructed of steel that is a minimum of
0.0217 inch thick.
– The duct cannot have openings that share the corridor with
adjacent spaces or rooms.
– The duct cannot terminate as a wall register in the fire-re-
sistance-rated wall.

98

CHAPTER 4

– A minimum 12-inch-long by 0.060-inch-thick sleeve has to
be centered in each duct opening.
– The sleeve will be secured to both sides of the wall and all
four sides of the sleeve must have steel retaining angles that
are a minimum of 1.5 inches by 1.5 inches by 0.060 inch.
– The retaining angles must be secured to the sleeve and the
wall with no. 10 screws.
– The annular space between the steel sleeve and the wall open-
ing must be filled with mineral wool batting on all sides.

Smoke Damper

A listed smoke damper is designed to resist smoke passing through areas of
buildings and is required to be provided at each point that a duct or air
transfer opening penetrates a corridor. However please note that smoke
dampers are not required when the building has an approved smoke con-
trol system in place throughout and they are also not required in corridor
penetrations if the duct is constructed of steel that is no less than 0.019 inch
thick and there are no openings in use for corridors. 

You must also have a smoke damper in place at each duct or air transfer
opening penetrating a smoke barrier unless the openings in the duct is a
single smoke compartment and constructed of steel. Penetrations by ducts
and air transfer openings of a floor or floor/ceiling assemblies or the ceil-

ing covering of a roof/ceiling assembly must be protected by a shaft enclo-
sure that complies with this chapter. In occupancies other than Groups 
I-2 and I-3, a duct that is constructed of approved materials in accordance
with the International Mechanical Code and penetrates a fire-resistance-
rated floor/ceiling that connects no more than two stories is permitted
without shaft enclosure protection, granted that a listed fire damper is in-
stalled at the floor line or the duct is protected. 

A duct is permitted to penetrate three floors or less without a fire damper
at each floor, provided it meets all of the following requirements:

䡲 The duct must be contained and located within the cavity of a
wall and must be constructed of steel that is no less than 0.019
inch in thickness.
䡲 The duct must open into only one dwelling or sleeping unit
and the duct system must be continuous from the unit to the
outside of the building.
䡲 The duct cannot be more than 4 inches nominal diameter and
the total area of the ducts cannot be more than 100 square
inches in any 100 square feet of floor area.
䡲 The annular space around the duct is protected with materials
that prevent the passage of flame and hot gases sufficient to ig-
nite cotton waste when exposed to ASTM E 119 time-temper-
ature conditions under a minimum positive pressure differ-
ence of 0.01 inch of water at the location of the penetration for
the time period equal to the fire-resistance rating of the con-
struction penetrated.
䡲 Grilled openings located in a ceiling of a fire-resistance-rated
floor/ceiling or roof/ceiling assembly must be protected with
an installed listed ceiling radiation damper.

CHAPTER 4

CONCEALED SPACES

In combustible concealed spaces fire-blocking and draft-stopping must be
installed. Fire-blocking materials must include nominal or standard lum-
ber that is at least 2 inches thick or two pieces of 1 inch lumber with bro-
ken lap joints. Other materials can include: one wood structural panel of at
least 0.719 inch that has joints backed by another wood structural panel of
the same thickness. You may also use gypsum board, cement fiber board,
batts or blankets of mineral wool, glass fiber, or any other approved mate-
rials. Always check with the building officer or your local code office to ob-
tain approval of your materials in question. 

All materials must be securely installed if to be considered for an appropri-
ate fire-block. Loose-fill insulation material cannot be used unless specifi-
cally tested in the form and manner intended for use and shown to be an
appropriate material that will remain in place and will repel the spread of
fire and hot gases. 

In walls that are made of double stud, batts and blankets of mineral or glass
fiber will be allowed as fire-blocking in walls using parallel rows of studs or
staggered studs. Speaking of stud walls and partitions, which include furred
spaces and parallel rows of studs, they must be vertically at the ceiling and
floor levels or horizontally at intervals that are not more than 10 feet.

Fire-blocking must be provided for the following areas:

䡲 Connections between horizontal and vertical spaces that are
between the stud walls
䡲 Concealed horizontal spaces created by an assembly of floor
joists or trusses
䡲 Between concealed horizontal and vertical spaces such as sof-
fits and drop and cove ceilings

䡲 In concealed spaces in stairways between stringers at the top
and the bottom of the run
䡲 Annular spaces in openings around vents, pipes, ducts, chim-
neys and fireplaces at ceiling and floor levels. Note: factory-
built chimneys and fireplaces must be fire-blocked in accor-
dance with UL 103 and UL 127.

Architectural trim that has concealed spaces of outside wall finish and
other outside architectural elements must also have fire-blocking installed
where erected with combustible frames, at maximum intervals of 20 feet,
so that there are no open spaces more than 100 square feet. If wood furring
strips are used, they need to be made of an approved wood that has a nat-
ural decay resistance or preservative-treated wood. 

Fire-blocking is not required of cornices in single-family homes, however
in two-family homes you must install fire-blocking, but only at the line of
separation between the two homes. If the framing of the building or struc-
ture and the face of the outside wall finish is covered by aluminum that is
at least 0.019 inch thick or corrosion-resistant steel with a base metal thick-
ness at least 0.016 inch or any other approved materials, you are not re-
quired to install fire-blocking.

In concealed sleeper spaces where wood sleepers are used for laying wood
floors on masonry or concrete fire-resistance-rated floors, the space be-
tween the floor slab and the bottom of the wood flooring must be filled
with an approved material to resist the passage of flame and products of
combustion of fire-blocked so that there will be no open spaces under the
flooring that will be more than 100 square feet in area. 

Any empty spaces must be filled so that they are solid full under permanent
partitions and there is no passing under the flooring between adjacent
rooms. This includes the joint at each alternate lane and at the ends of each
lane in a bowling alley. However, gymnasium floors that are slab-on-grade
are not required to have fire-blocking. 

Draft Stopping

Fire-blocking has a “friend” that we must not forget about—draft-stop-
ping. One cannot be without the other. All combustible construction must

102

CHAPTER 4

have draft-stopping installed to sub-divide floor/ceiling assemblies in loca-
tions and occupancies that follow. There are several approved materials
that you can use for draft-stopping. Any material that you use cannot be
less than 0.5 inches. But first, let’s take a look at the required materials that
draft-stopping must be made of:

䡲 Gypsum board—0.375 inch (9.5 mm)
䡲 Wood structural panel—0.375 inch (9.5 mm)
䡲 Particle board—1 inch (25-mm), nominal lumber
䡲 Cement fiberboard, batts, or blankets of mineral wool or glass
fiber, or other approved materials that offer enough support
can also be used for draft-stopping. 

Now that you know what materials you can use for draft-stopping, I will go
into the occupancies in which draft-stopping must in installed. Groups R-
1, R-2, R-3, and R-4 all require draft-stopping in certain situations. 

Group R-1 must provide draft-stopping in floor/ceiling spaces. Draft-stop-
ping must be provided in Group R-2 buildings with three or more dwelling
units, Group R-3 buildings with two dwelling units, and in Group R-4
buildings. Draft-stopping must be located above and in line with the
dwelling unit and sleeping unit separations. Draft-stopping must also be
installed in attics to sub-divide attic and concealed roof spaces. Draft-stop-
ping is not required in buildings equipped throughout with automatic
sprinkler systems as long as the sprinklers are also installed in the com-
bustible concealed spaces. In all other groups, draft-stopping must be in-
stalled so that horizontal floor areas are not more than 1000 square feet. 

In Groups R-1 and R-2 draft-stopping must be provided in attics, mansards,
overhangs, or other concealed roof spaces of Group R-2 buildings with three
or more dwelling units in all Group R-1 buildings. Draft-stopping must be
installed above, and in line with, sleeping unit and dwelling unit separation
walls that do not extend to the bottom of the roof sheathing above. There are
three exceptions however that you must be aware of:

䡲 In cases where corridor walls provide a sleeping unit or
dwelling unit separation, draft-stopping is only required above
one of the corridor walls.

FIRE-RESISTANCE-RATED CONSTRUCTION

103

䡲 Draft-stopping is not required in buildings that are equipped
throughout with an automatic sprinkler system, only if com-
bustible concealed spaces are included in the system.

䡲 In occupancies in Group R-2 that are not more than four sto-
ries in height, the attic space does not need to be subdivided by
draft-stops into an area that is not more than 3000 square feet
or above every two dwelling units, or whichever is smaller.

THERMAL AND SOUND-INSULATING MATERIALS

Insulating materials that include facings such as vapor retardants and va-
por-permeable membranes, similar coverings, and all layers of single and
multilayer reflective foil insulations must comply with this section. Flame
spread indexes or a smoke-developed index must be determined with
ASTM E 84. Any material that is subject to an increase in flame spread in-
dex or smoke-developed index beyond the limits of this code because of
the age of the material, moisture, or other conditions caused by exposure
to the atmosphere for a long period of time are not permitted. 

Concealed and exposed insulation when installed in buildings of any type
of construction must always have a flame index of no more than 25 and
smoke-developed index of no more than 450. This does not apply to build-
ings of Type III, IV, or V construction regarding the flame spread for fac-
ings, coverings, and layers of reflective foil insulation that are installed be-
hind and in contact with the unexposed surface of the ceiling, wall, or floor
finish. However, exposed insulation that is installed on attic floors must
have a critical radiant flux of no less than 0.12 watt per square centimeter
when tested in accordance with ASTM E 970. 

Loose-Fill Insulation

Another type of insulation is loose-fill. This type of insulation cannot be
heaped in the ASTM E 84 apparatus without a screen or support unless it
complies with the flame spread and smoke-developed limits. If the loose-
fill insulation that you are using is cellulose it does not have to comply with
the frame spread index that is required of CAN/ULC S102.2. But, you need
to be aware that loose-fill insulation does have to comply with CPSC 16
CFR, Part 1209, and CPSC 16, Part 1404 when applicable and must be la-

104

CHAPTER 4

beled as such. Combustible roof insulation that does not comply with this
section can be used in any type of construction, but it needs to be covered
with an approved roof covering.

We have completed this chapter and are now ready to move into Chapter 5.

CHAPTER

Fire Protection Systems

This chapter specifies where fire protection systems are required and how
they must apply to the design, installation, and operation of fire protection
systems. I have included definitions exclusive to this chapter subject. In-
stallation, repair, operation, and maintenance of fire protection systems
must be in accordance with this code and the International Fire Code. This
includes modifications which are required to follow this code and the In-
ternational Fire Code; you must also get approval from the building offi-
cial—there are no exceptions to this rule. 

If you are using or installed a fire protection system or part of one that is
not required by this code, it also must meet the requirements of this code.
When you are installing threads that are provided for fire department con-
nections to sprinkler systems, standpipes, yard hydrants, or any other fire
hose connections you must make certain that they are compatible with the
connections that are used by the local fire department. A simple phone call
or visit to the fire department can save time and money or even a code 
decision by ensuring that you’ve made sure that these connections are a
match.

105

106

CHAPTER 5

All fire protection systems must be tested in accordance with the require-
ments of this code and the International Fire Code. If testing is required it is
your responsibility that it is conducted in the presence of the code official. It
is not enough to have the test(s) done; the building official must see the tests
from start to finish. The costs of these tests are at the expense of the owner or
a person representing the owner. It is very important that you realize that it
is illegal to occupy a structure or even a portion of the structure if the proper
testing has not been done and/or approved by the building official.

Fire protection systems must be monitored (where required) by an approved
supervising station in accordance with NFPA 72. All automatic sprinkler sys-
tems must also be monitored by an approved supervising station with the ex-
ception of automatic sprinkler systems protecting one- and two-family
housing units and limited area systems that serve fewer than 20 sprinklers.

Fire alarm systems require similar monitoring with an approved supervis-
ing station with the exception of single- and multiple-station smoke alarms
and smoke detectors in Group I-3 occupancies. Manual fire alarms, auto-
matic fire-extinguishing, and emergency alarm systems in Group H occu-
pancies must be monitored by an approved supervising station as well. 

When approved by the building official, on-site monitoring at a constantly
attended location can be permitted. This is true only if the owner provides
that notifications to the fire department will be equal to those provided by
an approved supervising station.

DEFINITIONS

Below you will find definitions that pertain to this chapter; I have also scat-
tered them throughout the chapter. These words and terms, for the pur-
pose of this chapter, will have the meanings shown.

signal.

AUTOMATIC SPRINKLER SYSTEMS

All automatic sprinkler systems installed in a structure must follow the
rules or codes of this section. If you plan on or are using alternative auto-
matic fire-extinguishing systems complying with this chapter, they must be
recognized by the applicable standard and approved by the fire code offi-
cial and all new buildings and structures must be provided with approved
automatic sprinkler systems and comply with this code. This chapter cov-
ers classifications of buildings by group and informs you of what the code
specifies for these group classifications.

Group A

Group A requires an automatic sprinkler system for Group A-1 occupan-
cies where one or more of the following conditions exist:

䡲 The fire area exceeds 12,000 square feet.
䡲 The fire area has an occupant load of more than 300 people.

䡲 The fire area is located on a floor other than the level of exit
doors.
䡲 The fire area contains a multi-theater complex.

The following list pertains to Group A-2 occupancies and the following
conditions in which automatic sprinkler systems are mandatory by this
code:

䡲 The fire area exceeds 5000 square feet.
䡲 The fire area has an occupant load of 100 or more.
䡲 The fire area is located on a floor other than the level of exit
doors.

Group A-3 and Group A-4

An automatic sprinkler system must be provided for Group A-3 and
Group A-4 occupancies as the following conditions exist:

䡲 The fire area exceeds 12,000 square feet.
䡲 The fire area has an occupant load of 300 or more.
䡲 The fire area is located on a floor other that the level of exit
doors.

Group A-3 and A-4 have the same exception to these rules: any areas used
exclusively as participant sport areas where the main floor area is located at
the same level as the level of exit of the main entrance and exit.

Group A-5

Group A-5 occupancies must be equipped with an automatic sprinkler sys-
tem in the following areas:

Group I

Institutional groups which are classified as Group I are required to install
automatic sprinkler systems. Any automatic sprinkler systems that are of
an NFPA 13R sprinkler system and installed in accordance to code are 
allowed to be installed in Group-I institutional groups. Group M occupan-
cies which have one of the following conditions are required to have an 
automatic sprinkler system installed throughout the building. These con-
ditions are:

䡲 Any Group M fire area that is more than 12,000 square feet
䡲 A Group M fire area that is located more than three stories
above grade plane
䡲 Where the combined area of all Group M fire areas on all
floors, including any mezzanines, exceeds 24,000 square feet.

Constant attended location: A location designated at a facility that
is staffed on a continuous basis by trained personnel. Alarms and
supervisory signals are monitored and facilities are provided for
notification of the fire department or other emergency services.

Group S-1

In Groups S-1 the entire building is required to be equipped with an auto-
matic sprinkler system where one of the following conditions exists:

䡲 Any Group S-1 fire area that is more than 12,000 square feet.
䡲 A Group S-1 fire area is located more than three stories above

䡲 The combined area of all Group S-1 fire areas on all floors, in-
cluding any mezzanines, is more than 24,000 square feet.

MONITORING AND ALARMS

When speaking of fire safety and automatic sprinkler systems we must look
at sprinkler system monitoring and alarms. All valves controlling the water
supply for automatic sprinkler systems, pumps, tanks, water levels and tem-
peratures, critical air pressures, and water-flow switches on all sprinkler sys-
tems must be electrically supervised. Exceptions to this rule are:

䡲 Automatic sprinkler systems protecting one-and two-family
dwellings
䡲 Limited area systems serving fewer than 20 sprinklers
䡲 Automatic sprinkler systems installed in accordance with
NFPA 13R where a common supply main is used to supply
both domestic water and the automatic sprinkler systems and
a separate shutoff valve for the automatic sprinkler system is
not provided

䡲 Valves controlling the fuel supply to fire pump engines that are
sealed or locked in the open position
䡲 Trim valves to pressure switches in dry, pre-action, and deluge
sprinkler systems that are sealed or locked in the open position.

Alarm, supervisory, and trouble signals must be distinctly different and au-
tomatically sent to an approved central station, remote supervising station,
or proprietary supervising station as defined in NFPA 72 or, when approved
by the fire code official, must sound an audible signal at a constantly at-
tended location. There are two exceptions to this rule. The first exception
states that underground key or hub valves in roadway boxes provided by the
municipality or public utility are not required to be monitored.

The second exception states that backflow prevention device test valves lo-
cated in limited area sprinkler system supply piping must be locked in the
open position. In occupancies required to be equipped with a fire alarm sys-
tem, the backflow preventer valves must be electrically supervised by a tamper
switch installed in accordance with NFPA 72 and separately annunciated. 

Alarm devices must be provided on the outside of the building in an ap-
proved location. Where a fire alarm system is installed, the motion of the
automatic sprinkler system must set off the building fire alarm system.
Don’t forget this very important detail: all sprinkler systems must be tested
and maintained in accordance with the International Fire Code.

A notification zone is an area within a building or facility covered by
notification appliances which are activated simultaneously.

ALTERNATIVE SYSTEMS

If you plan on installing an alternative automatic fire-extinguishing system
there are codes that also need to be obeyed. Any automatic fire-extinguish-
ing systems, other than automatic sprinkler systems, must be designed, in-
stalled, inspected, tested, and maintained in accordance with the next sec-
tion and the applicable referenced standards. Any automatic fire-
extinguishing systems installed as an alternative to the required automatic
sprinkler systems in this chapter must be approved by the fire code official.
You may not use automatic fire-extinguishing systems as alternatives for
the purpose of exceptions or reductions that are allowed by other require-
ments of this code. What this means is that a building owner cannot sub-
stitute with an alternate system in hopes of applying this to an exception to
the code. It just doesn’t work in this manner. 

Before conducting final acceptance tests, the following items must be 
inspected:

䡲 Hazard specification for consistency with design hazard
䡲 Type, location, and spacing of automatic-and manual-initiat-
ing devices
䡲 Size, placement and position of nozzles or discharge holes
䡲 Location and identification of audible and visible alarm 
devices
䡲 Identification of devices with proper designations

tems of the type and arrangement protected. Pre-engineered automatic
dry- and wet-chemical extinguishing systems must be tested in accordance
with UL 300 and listed and labeled for the intended application. 

Automatic fire-extinguishing systems of the following types must be in-

Standpipe system: An arrangement of piping valves, hose
connections, and allied equipment installed in a building or
structure with the hose connections located in such a manner that
water can be discharged in streams or spray patterns through
attached hoses and nozzles.

Commercial cooking systems must have a manual actuation device to be lo-
cated at or near a means of exit from the cooking area a minimum of 10 feet
and a maximum of 20 feet from the kitchen exhaust system. The manual ac-
tuation device must be installed not more than 48 inches or less than 42
inches above the floor and must clearly identify the hazard protected. The
manual motion must require a maximum force of 40 pounds and a maxi-
mum movement of 14 inches to set the fire suppression system in motion. 

Automatic sprinkler systems are not required to be equipped with manual
movement means. This fire suppression system must automatically shut
down the fuel or electrical power supply to the cooking equipment and the
supply must be re-set manually. If and when carbon dioxide systems are used,
there must be a nozzle at the top of the ventilating duct. Additional nozzles
that are balanced to give uniform distribution must be installed within verti-
cal ducts larger than 20 feet and horizontal ducts larger than 50 feet.

Dampers must be installed at either the top or the bottom of the duct and
must be arranged to operate automatically upon activation of the fire-ex-
tinguishing system. If the damper is installed at the top of the duct, the top
nozzle must be immediately below the damper.

STANDPIPE SYSTEMS

Standpipe systems must be provided in new buildings and structures in ac-
cordance with this chapter. Fire hose threads used in connection with
standpipe systems must be approved and must be compatible with fire de-
partment hose threads. The location of fire department hose connections
must be approved as well. When it comes to standpipe systems, there are
many code rules that must be followed. 

All standpipe systems must be installed in accordance with this section and
NFPA 14. Standpipe systems are allowed to be combined with automatic
sprinkler systems, but are not required in Group R-3 occupancies. 

There are various classes of standpipes to be aware of when it comes to instal-
lation of standpipes. Class III standpipe systems must be installed throughout
buildings where the floor level of the highest story is located more than 30 feet
above the lowest level of fire department vehicle access, or where the floor
level of the lowest story is located more than 30 feet below the highest level of
fire department vehicle access. There are exceptions to this rule.

CLASS I

Class I standpipes have many conditions associated with their use. The list
below will begin our investigation into Class I systems:

䡲 Class I standpipes are allowed in buildings equipped through-
out with an automatic sprinkler system in accordance with this
chapter.

CODE UPDATECODE UPDATE

Cabinets that are used to house portable fire extinguishers shall not

FIRE PROTECTION SYSTEMS

117

CODE UPDATECODE UPDATE

Portable fire extinguishers are not allowed to be concealed from
view, unless suitable signage exists to show the location of the fire
extinguishers.

䡲 Class I manual standpipes are allowed in open parking garages
where the highest floor is located not more than 150 feet above
the lowest level of fire department vehicle access.
䡲 Class I manual dry standpipes are allowed in open parking
garages that are subject to freezing temperatures, provided that
the hose connections are located as required for Class II stand-
pipes in accordance with this section.
䡲 Class I standpipes are allowed in basements equipped
throughout with an automatic sprinkler system.
䡲 In determining the lowest level of fire department vehicle ac-
cess, it must not be required to consider recessed loading docks
for four vehicles or less or conditions where topography makes
access from the fire department vehicle to the building imprac-
tical or impossible.

Class I automatic wet standpipes must be provided in non-sprinklered
Group A buildings having an occupant load exceeding 1000 persons except
for open-air-seating spaces that are without enclosed spaces or Class I au-
tomatic dry and semi-automatic dry standpipes or manual wet standpipes
are allowed in buildings where the highest floor surface used for human oc-
cupancy is 75 feet or less above the lowest level of fire department vehicle
access.

Some groups have special requirements when it comes to standpipes such
as covered mall buildings. The code clearly states that a building such as
this must be equipped throughout with a standpipe system where required
by this chapter. 

As the owner or contractor of a building you must provide the following
hose connections in the locations that it states:

118

CHAPTER 5

䡲 Within the mall at the entrance to each exit passageway or
corridor

䡲 At each floor-level landing within enclosed stairways opening
directly on the mall

䡲 At exterior public entrances to the mall.

Stages are another classification that requires standpipes. Any stage that is
greater than 1000 square felt in area must be equipped with a Class III wet
standpipe system with 1.5 inch and 2.5 inch hose connections on each side
of the stage. The exception to this is where the building or area is equipped
throughout with an automatic sprinkler system; the 1.5 inch hose connec-
tion must be installed in accordance with NFPA 13 or in accordance with
NFPA 14 for Class II or III standpipes. The 1.5 inch hose connections must
be equipped with sufficient lengths of 1.5 inch hose to provide fire protec-
tion for the stage area. 

Hose connections must be equipped with an approved adjustable fog noz-
zle and be mounted in a cabinet or on a rack. Make yourself aware that all
underground buildings must be equipped throughout with a Class I auto-
matic wet or manual wet standpipe system. 

Buildings that are equipped with a helistop or heliport that contain a stand-
pipe must extend the standpipe to the roof level on which the helistop or
heliport is located in accordance with Section 1107.5 of the International
Fire Code. Marinas and boatyards must also be equipped throughout with
standpipe systems in accordance with NFPA 303. The following list con-
tains all locations that Class I standpipe hose connections must be provided:

䡲 In every required stairway, a hose connection must be pro-
vided for each floor level above or below grade. 

䡲 Hose connections must be located at an intermediate floor
level landing between floors, unless otherwise approved by the
fire code official.
䡲 On each side of the wall adjacent to the exit opening of a hor-
izontal exit, except where floor areas that are adjacent to a
horizontal exit are reachable from exit stairway hose connec-

䡲 Where the roof has a slope less than four units vertical in 12
units horizontal, each standpipe must be provided with a hose
connection located either on the roof or at the highest landing
of stairways with stair access to the roof. An additional hose
connection must be provided at the top of the most hydrauli-
cally remote standpipe for testing purposes.
䡲 Where the most remote portion of a nonsprinklered floor or
story is more than 200 feet from a hose connection, the fire
code official is authorized to require that additional hose con-
nections be provided in approved locations.

CLASS II AND CLASS III STANDPIPE SYSTEMS

Class II standpipe hose connections must be accessible and located so that
all portions of the buildings are within 30 feet of a nozzle attached to 100

than 1000 hose connections must be located on each side of any stage, on
each side of the rear of the auditorium, on each side of the balcony, and on
each tier of dressing rooms. Fire-resistance-rated protection of riser and
laterals of Class II standpipe systems is not required, but for Class II sys-
tems a minimum 1-inch hose is permitted to be used for hose stations in
light-hazard occupancies where investigated and listed for this service and
where approved by the fire code official. Location of Class III standpipe
hose connections has the same requirements of those for Class I standpipes
and must have Class II hose connections as required in this chapter. You
must not forget that risers and laterals of Class III standpipe systems must
be protected as required for Class I systems as well. In buildings where
more than one Class III standpipe is provided, the standpipes must be in-
terconnected at the bottom. 

As with all code regulations you must contact your local building code of-
ficial for any additional information or for any questions you may have.
There is no such thing as a stupid question. This code is designed to pro-
tect everyone, so please be sure that you understand the code and question
the code when needed. 

ALARM AND DETECTION SYSTEMS

Construction documents for fire alarm systems must be permitted for re-
view and approval before you install any system. Construction documents
must include, but are not be limited to, all of the following:

䡲 A floor plan which indicates the use of all rooms
䡲 Locations of alarm-initiating and notification appliances
䡲 Alarm control and trouble signaling equipment
䡲 Annunciation
䡲 Power connection

Systems and their components must be listed and approved for the pur-
pose for which they are installed. An approved manual, automatic, or man-
ual and automatic fire alarm system installed in accordance with the pro-
visions of this code and NFPA 72 must be provided in new buildings and
structures in accordance with this chapter, where applicable, and provide
occupant notification unless other requirements are provided by another
chapter or section of this code. 

Automatic sprinkler protection that is installed in accordance with this
section is provided and connected to the building fire alarm system; auto-
matic heat detection required by this section is not required. The auto-
matic fire detectors must be smoke detectors. Where ambient conditions
prohibit installation of automatic smoke detection, other automatic fire
detection must be allowed. 

SMOKE CONTROL

You must install and maintain smoke control systems. The simple issue
with smoke control systems is to be able to control smoke during a fire in-
cident so that the danger is contained and the building can be safely evac-
uated. This section applies to mechanical or passive smoke control systems
when they are required by other provisions of this code. The purpose of

122

CHAPTER 5

this section is to establish the minimum requirements for the design, in-
stallation, and acceptance testing of smoke control systems that are in-
tended to provide a tenable environment for the evacuation or relocation
of occupants.

Buildings, structures, or parts thereof are required by this code to have a
smoke control system(s) designed in accordance with the applicable re-
quirements of this section and the generally accepted and well-established
principles of engineering relevant to the design. All construction docu-
ments must include sufficient information and detail to adequately de-
scribe the elements of the design necessary for the proper implementation
of the smoke control systems. These documents must be accompanied by
sufficient information and analysis to demonstrate compliance with these
provisions.

All buildings and structures are required to have ordinary inspections and
test requirements, but smoke control systems are mandated to undergo
special inspections and tests sufficient to verify the proper commissioning
of the smoke control design in its final installed condition. You must in-
clude detail procedures and methods to be used and the items subject to
these inspections and tests on the design submission documents. This
commissioning must be in accordance with generally accepted engineering
practice and, where possible, based on published standards for the partic-
ular testing that is involved. 

The smoke control system must be supplied with two sources of power.
Primary power must be from the normal building power system. Second-
ary power must be from an approved standby source complying with the
ICC Electrical Code. 

CODE UPDATECODE UPDATE

Where delayed egress locks are installed on means of egress doors
an automatic smoke or heat detection system shall also be installed.

FIRE PROTECTION SYSTEMS

123

The standby power source and its transfer switches must be in a separate
room from the normal power transformers and switch gear. It must be en-
closed in a room that is constructed of not less than one-hour fire barriers that
is ventilated directly to and from the outside. All power distribution from the
two sources must come from independent routes. The transfer to full standby
power has to be automatic and within 60 seconds of failure of the primary
power. This system is required to comply with this code or the ICC Electrical
Code. It is imperative that control systems for mechanical smoke control sys-
tems include provisions for verification. A verification list follows:

䡲 Positive confirmation of actuation
䡲 Testing
䡲 Manual override
䡲 The presence of power downstream of all disconnects
䡲 A preprogrammed weekly test sequence
䡲 Report abnormal conditions audibly, visually, and by printed
report.

Activation of smoke control systems must follow code regulations. Me-
chanical smoke control systems that use pressurization, airflow, or exhaust
method must have completely automatic control. Passive smoke control
systems actuated by approved spot-type detectors listed for releasing serv-
ice are permitted. Where your smoke control system is completely auto-
matic, the automatic-control sequence has to be initiated from an appro-
priately zoned automatic sprinkler system complying with this section,
manual controls that are readily accessible to the fire department and any
smoke detectors required by engineering analysis. 

Don’t forget that any detection and control systems must be clearly
marked at all junctions, accesses, and terminations and identical control
diagrams showing all devices in the system and identifying their location
and function must be maintained current and kept on file with the fire
code official, the fire department, and in the fire command center in a for-
mat and manner that has been approved by the fire chief. 

A fire-fighter’s smoke control panel for fire department emergency re-
sponse purposes only must be provided and has to include manual control

or override of automatic control for mechanical smoke control systems.
The panel will be located in a fire command center in high-rise buildings
or buildings with smoke-protected assembly seating. In all other buildings,
the fire-fighter’s smoke control panel must be installed in an approved lo-
cation adjacent to the fire alarm control panel. The fire-fighter’s smoke
control panel must comply with the International Building Code book.

With all these fire and smoke alarm systems in place we cannot forget
smoke and heat vents. Where smoke and heat vents are required by this
code, or otherwise installed, smoke and heat vents, or mechanical smoke
exhaust systems, and draft curtains must conform to the requirements of
this section. There are two exceptions to this. Frozen food warehouses used
solely for storage of Class I and II merchandise where protected by an ap-
proved automatic sprinkler system or areas of buildings that are equipped
with early suppression fast response (ESFR) sprinklers, automatic smoke
and heat vents are not required. 

Smoke and heat vents must be installed in the roofs of Group F-1 and S-1
buildings that have occupancy or more than 50,000 square feet, except for
Group S-1 aircraft repair hangars. 

CHAPTER

Means of Egress

The provisions of this chapter control the design, construction, and
arrangement of means of egress, or simply put, exit tools that are required
to provide an approved means of exit from structures or portions thereof.
It is against code to alter a building or structure in a manner that will re-
duce the number of exits or the capacity of the exits to be any less than is
required by this code. All means of exits must be maintained in accordance
with the International Fire Code. 

GENERAL MEANS OF EXITS

The general requirements specified in this section apply to all three elements
of the means of exit, or a way out or egress (please note that the words way
out, exit, and egress may be used interchangeably and have the same mean-
ing) system, in addition to those specific requirements for the exit access, the
exit, and the exit discharge detailed elsewhere in this chapter. 

While at the ceiling construction phase keep in mind there must be a min-
imum of 80 inches for headroom for any walking surface, including walks,

125

126

CHAPTER 6

corridors, aisles, and passageways. Not more than 50 percent of the ceiling
area of the means of exit can be reduced in height by protruding objects; an
exception to this is door closers and stoppers. The code states that these
cannot reduce headroom to less than 78 inches and you must provide a
barrier where the vertical clearance is less than 80 inches high. 

The leading edge of any barrier must be located 27 inches (maximum)
from the floor. If you have installed a free-standing object that is mounted
on a post or pylon, it cannot overhang more than 4 inches where the low-
est point of the leading edge is more than 27 inches and less than 80 inches
above the walking surface. 

If a sign or other obstruction is mounted between posts or pylons and the
clear distance between the posts/pylons is greater than 12 inches then the
lowest edge of the sign or obstruction must be 27 inches maximum or 80
inches minimum above the finished floor or ground, except that this re-
quirement shall not apply to sloping portions of handrails serving stairs
and ramps. 

Structural elements, fixtures, or furnishings cannot project horizontally
from either side more than 4 inches over any walking surface between the
heights of 27 inches and 80 inches above the walking surface (handrails
that service stairs and ramps are permitted to protrude 4.5 inches from the
wall). Protruding objects will not reduce the minimum clear width of ac-
cessible routes.

Note that all walking surfaces of the means of exits must have a slip-resist-
ant surface and be securely attached. This will protect occupants when
traveling from rooms to exits. In those places where changes in elevation of
less than 12 inches exist in the way of exits, sloped surfaces must be used.
If the slope is greater than one side or the other, you must have a ramp in-

stalled that complies with this chapter. If the difference in elevation is 6
inches or less, the ramp must be equipped with either handrails or floor
finish materials that contrast with adjacent floor finish materials. The fol-
lowing is a list of exceptions that pertain to the elevation change:

䡲 A single step with a maximum riser height of 7 inches is per-
mitted for buildings with occupancies in Groups F, H, R-2,
and R-3 and Groups S and U at outside doors not required to
be accessible.
䡲 A stair with a single riser or with two risers and a tread is per-
mitted at locations not required to be accessible provided that
the risers and threads comply with this chapter, have a mini-
mum tread depth of 13 inches, and at least one handrail that
complies with this chapter is provided within 30 inches of the
centerline of the normal path of exit travel on the stair.
䡲 A step is allowed in aisles serving seating that has a difference in
elevation less than 12 inches at locations not required to be ac-
cessible provided that the risers and treads comply with this
chapter and the aisle has a handrail complying with this chapter.

Any change in elevation in a corridor serving non-ambulatory persons in
Group I-2 occupancy must be by means of a ramp or sloped walkway. The
path of the exit cannot be interrupted by any building element other than a
means of egress component as specified in this chapter. Obstructions cannot
be placed in the required width of a means of exit except projections that are
permitted by this chapter. The required capacity of a means of exit system
cannot be diminished along the path of exit travel. You cannot count eleva-
tors, escalators, and moving walks as a component of a required means of
egress from any other part of the building, except when elevators are used as
an accessible means of egress in accordance with this chapter.

128

CHAPTER 6

OCCUPANT LOAD

When you are constructing a building, you must always use the number of
occupants when determining any means of egress or exit. In areas where
occupants from accessory areas exit through a primary space, the calcu-
lated occupant load for the primary space must include the total occupant
load. Every room or space that is an assembly occupancy must have the oc-
cupant load of the room or space posted in a conspicuous place, near the
main exit or exit access doorway from the room or space. Posted signs
must be of an approved legible permanent design and must be maintained
by the owner or authorized agent. 

Where exits serve more than one floor, only the occupant load of each floor
considered individually must be used in computing the required capacity
of the exits at that floor, provided that the exit capacity will not decrease in
the direction of exit travel. Where means of egress from floors above and
below converge at an intermediate level, the capacity of the means of egress
from the point of junction must be less than the sum of the two floors.

The code contains the maximum floor area allowances per occupant. The
number of occupants must be computed at the rate of one occupant per
unit of area. Where an intended use is not listed, the building official will es-
tablish a use based on a listed use that most nearly resembles the intended
use. The exception being that where approved by the building official, the
actual number of occupants for whom each occupied space, floor, or build-
ing is designed, although less than those determined by calculation will be
permitted to be used in the determination of the design occupant load.

For areas that have fixed seats and aisles, the occupant load must be deter-
mined by the number of fixed seats installed. The occupant load for areas
in which fixed seating is not installed, such as waiting areas and wheelchair
spaces, must be determined in accordance with this chapter and added to

the number of fixed seats. For areas that have fixed seating without divid-
ing arms, the occupant load cannot be less than the number of seats bases

seating booths must be based on one person for each 24 inches of booth
seat length measured at the backrest of the seating booth.

MEANS OF EGRESS ILLUMINATION

The means of egress, including the exit discharge, must be illuminated at all
times in the building space that the egress occupies, except for the following:

䡲 Occupancies in Group U
䡲 Aisle access ways in Group A
䡲 Dwelling and sleeping units in Groups R-1, R-2, and R-3
䡲 Sleeping units of Group I occupancies.

The illumination level cannot be less than one foot-candle or 11 lux at the
walking surface level except for auditoriums, theaters, concert or opera
halls and similar assembly occupancies. The illumination at the walking
surface level is allowed to be reduced during performances to not less than
0.2 foot-candle, provided that the required illumination is automatically
restored upon activation of a premises’ fire alarm system where such sys-
tem is provided.

Fast Fact

This code requires that the total width of means of egress in inches
must not be less than the total occupant load served by the means of
egress multiplied by the factors in tables found in the code and not
less than specified elsewhere in this code. Multiple means of egress
much be sized such that the loss of any one means of egress must not
reduce the available capacity to less than 50 percent of the required
capacity. The maximum capacity required from any story of a building
shall be maintained to the termination of the means of egress.

Exit: That portion of a means of egress system which is separated
from other interior spaces of a building or structure by fire-
resistance-rated construction and opening protectives as required
providing a protected path of egress travel between the exit access
and the exit discharge. Exits include exterior exit doors at ground
level, exit enclosures, exit passageways, exterior exit stairs, exterior
exit ramps, and horizontal exits.

The power supply for exit illumination must normally be provided by the
electrical supply. In the event that the power supply is cut off an emergency
electrical system must automatically illuminate the following areas:

䡲 Aisles and unenclosed egress stairways in rooms and spaces
that require two or more means of exits
䡲 Corridors, exit enclosures, and exit passageways in buildings
required to have two or more exits
䡲 Exterior exit components at other than the level of exit dis-
charge until exit discharge is accomplished for buildings 
required to have two or more exits
䡲 Interior exit discharge elements, as permitted in this chapter,
in buildings required to have two or more exits
䡲 Exterior landings for exit discharge doorways in buildings 
required to have two or more exits.

ACCESSIBLE MEANS OF EGRESS

Accessible spaces are to be provided with no less than one means of acces-
sible means of egress. Three exceptions to accessible spaces exits are:

Fast Fact

The emergency power system must provide power for the duration
of not less than 90 minutes and has to consist of storage batteries,
unit equipment, or an on-site generator. 

䡲 One accessible means of egress is required from an accessible
mezzanine level in accordance with this chapter.
䡲 In assembly spaces with sloped floors, one accessible means of
egress is required from a space where the common path of
travel of the accessible route for access to the wheelchair spaces
meets the requirements in this chapter. 

Each required accessible means of egress must be continuous to a public
way and has to consist of one or more of the following components:

䡲 Accessible routes
䡲 Stairways within vertical exit enclosures
䡲 Exterior exit stairways
䡲 Elevators
䡲 Platform lifts
䡲 Horizontal exits
䡲 Ramps
䡲 Areas of refuge.

Accessible means of egress: A continuous and unobstructed way of
egress travel from any accessible point in a building or facility to a
public way.

132

CHAPTER 6

These components must comply with the International Building Code
book. At least one required accessible means of egress must be an elevator
complying with this section, except for buildings that are equipped
throughout with an automatic sprinkler system. The elevator is not re-
quired on floors provided with a horizontal exit and located at or above the
level of exit discharge or if the building provides a ramp that conforms to
this chapter.

The use of stairs for an accessible means of exit is common. In order to use
stairs in this capacity, the exit stairway has to have a clear width of 48 inches
between handrails and must either incorporate an area of refuge within an
enlarged floor-level landing or must be accessed from either an area of
refuge or a horizontal exit. Please see the following list for exceptions.

䡲 Unenclosed exit stairways as permitted by this chapter are al-
lowed to be considered part of an accessible means of egress.
䡲 The area of refuge is not required at unenclosed exit stairways
as permitted by this chapter in buildings or facilities that are
equipped throughout with an automatic sprinkler system.
䡲 The clear width of 48 inches between handrails is not required at
exit stairways in buildings or facilities equipped throughout
with an automatic sprinkler system installed or for exit stairways
accessed from a horizontal exit.
䡲 Areas of refuge are not required at exit stairways serving open
parking garages.

In order to be considered part of an accessible means of egress, an elevator
must comply with the emergency operation and signaling device require-
ments or Section 2.27 of ASME A17.1, and standby power must be pro-
vided. The elevator must be accessed from either an area of refuge comply-
ing with this chapter or a horizontal exit; elevators are not required to be
accessed from an area of refuge or horizontal exit in open parking garages. 

Lifts that are used for wheelchairs do not serve as part of an accessible means
of egress, except where allowed as part of a required accessible route. If you
plan on installing a platform lift on an accessible means of egress, they can-
not be installed in a fully enclosed or fire-rated shaft. 

MEANS OF EGRESS

133

In your building structure you must have an area of refuge, which is re-
quired by code. This refuge space must be accessible from the space it
serves by an easily reached means of an exit or way out. Keep in mind that
this accessible space to the exit has to have a maximum travel distance and
cannot be more than the travel distance that is permitted for the type of oc-
cupancy that you have built. Also, every required area of refuge must have
a direct access to an enclosed stairway or an elevator. 

You may use an elevator lobby for an area of refuge as well, and it must
comply with the code regarding smokeproof enclosures. In regards to any
refuge, stairway, or elevator and lobby they all must comply with the code
in this chapter. Don’t be fooled into thinking that just by obeying the code
to provide refuge areas is enough. There is a size requirement as well. 

Each area of refuge must always be large enough to accommodate one wheel-
chair space of 30 inches by 48 inches for each 200 occupants, based on the
occupant load of the area of refuge and areas that are served by these areas.
The wheelchair spaces cannot reduce the required means of egress width and
access to any of the required wheelchair spaces in an area of refuge can never
be obstructed by more than one adjoining wheelchair space. 

A separation of each area of refuge by a smoke barrier is mandated. This
barrier must comply with the code or a horizontal exit complying with this
chapter. Each area of refuge must be designed to minimize the intrusion of
smoke, except for those areas which are located within a vertical exit enclo-
sure. Each area of refuge must have a central control point and must be
equipped with a two-way communication system. 

If the central control point is not constantly attended, the area has to have
controlled access to a public telephone. All locations of the central control
point must have a stamp of approval by the fire department. Don’t forget

that when you choose a two-way communication system that it must have
both audible and visible signals. Make sure that in any areas of refuge in-
structions on the use of the areas (under emergency conditions) are posted
with the communications system. All instructions must have the following
items included in them:

䡲 Directions to find other means of egress
䡲 Persons able to use the exit stairway must do so as soon as pos-
sible, unless they are assisting others.
䡲 Information on planned availability of assistance in the use of
stairs or supervised operation of elevators and how to ask for
such assistance
䡲 Directions for the use of the emergency communications system.

Each door that provides access to an area of refuge from an adjacent floor
area must be identified by a sign that complies with ICC A117.1; it must
clearly state: AREA OF REFUGE and it also has to include the International
Symbol of Accessibility. In places that require an illuminated sign, the area
of refuge sign must be illuminated. 

DOORS, GATES, AND TURNSTILES

The above is just one definition of a door. This section has many code rules
regarding doors, gates, and turnstiles, all of which are used as a means of exit.
Means of doors must be readily distinguishable from the adjacent construc-
tion and finishes such that the doors are easily recognizable as doors. 

Mirrors or similar reflecting materials will not be used on means of exit
doors. Means of exit doors will not be hidden by curtains, drapes, decora-
tions, or similar materials. 

MEANS OF EGRESS

135

The minimum width allowed of each door opening has to be sufficient for
the occupant load and has to provide a clear width of not less than 32
inches. If the doorway has swinging doors the clear opening has to be
measured between the face of the door and the stop, with the door open 90
degrees. Where this section requires a minimum clear width of 32 inches
and a door opening includes two door leaves without a mullion, which is a
vertical piece of wood that divides the opening, one leaf must provide a
clear opening width of 32 inches. 

The maximum width of a swinging door leaf has to be 48 inches nominal.
Exit doors in a Group I-2 occupancy used for the movement of beds must
have a clear width not less than 41.5 inches. One more thing: the height of
all doors cannot be less than 80 inches. Review the following list of excep-
tions of width and height of doors:

䡲 The minimum and maximum width does not apply to door
openings that are not part of the required means of egress in
Group R-2 and R-3 occupancies.
䡲 Door openings to resident sleeping units in Group I-3 occu-
pancies must have a clear width of not less than 28 inches.
䡲 Door openings to storage closets less than 10 square feet in area
are not limited by the minimum width.
䡲 Width of door leafs in revolving doors that comply with this
chapter are not limited.
䡲 Door openings within a dwelling or sleeping unit cannot be
less than 78 inches in height.
䡲 Outside door openings in dwellings and sleeping units, other
than the required exit door, are not to be less than 76 inches in
height.

䡲 In other than Group R-1 occupancies, the minimum widths apply
to inside exit doors within a dwelling or sleeping unit that is not re-
quired to be an accessible unit, Type A or Type B unit.
䡲 Door openings required to be accessible within Type B units
must have a minimum clear width of 31.75 inches.

For doors that have the required clear width of less than 34 inches above
the ground, there must be no projections. Projections into the clear open-
ing width between 34 inches and 80 inches above the floor or ground can-
not exceed 4 inches. Did you know that exit doors must be side-hinged
swinging? Read on for exceptions to this rule.

䡲 Private garages, office areas, factory and storage areas with an
occupant load of 10 or less
䡲 Group I-3 occupancies used as a place of detention

latch must release when subjected to a 15-pound force. Plus, the door must be
set in motion when faced with a 30-pound force. The door must swing to a full-
open position when subjected to a 15-pound force. All forces must be applied
to the side with the latch. If you have installed special doors, such as revolving
doors, and security grilles they must comply with the following list:

䡲 Each revolving door has to be capable of collapsing into a book
fold position with parallel exit paths providing an aggregate
width of 36 inches.
䡲 A revolving door cannot be located within 10 feet of the foot of
or top of stairs or escalators. 
䡲 A dispersal area must be provided between stairs or escalators
and revolving doors.
䡲 The revolutions per minute for a revolving door cannot be
more than those shown in the code.
䡲 Each revolving door must have a side-hinged swinging door
which complies with this chapter in the same wall and within
10 feet of the revolving door.

A revolving door that is used as a component of a means of exit must com-
ply with this chapter and meet the following conditions:

䡲 Revolving doors cannot be given credit for more than 50 per-
cent of the required exit capacity.
䡲 Each revolving door must be credited with no more than a 50-
person capacity.
䡲 Each revolving door must be capable of being collapsed when
a force of no more than 130 pounds is applied within 3 inches
of the outer edge of a wing.

If a revolving door is being used as other than a component of a means of
egress then the collapsing force of a revolving door not used in this capac-
ity must have a means of egress not more than 180 pounds. An exception
to this is a collapsing force in excess of 180 pounds is permitted if the col-

䡲 There is an actuation of the automatic sprinkler system where
this system is provided
䡲 There is an actuation of a smoke detection system which is in-
stalled to provide coverage within the building which is within
75 feet of the revolving doors
䡲 There is an actuation of a manual control switch, in an ap-
proved location and clearly defined, which reduces the holding
force to below the 130-pound force level. 

FLOORS AND LANDINGS

Floors and landings have to be at the same elevation on each side of a door.
Landings must be level, except for outside landings which are allowed to
have a slope that does not exceed 0.25 unit vertical in 12 unit horizontal or
2-percent slope. See the list below for exceptions:

䡲 Doors serving individual dwelling units in Groups R-2 and

terior flight of stairs provided the door does not swing over the
top step, however, screen and storm doors are permitted to
swing over stairs or landings
䡲 In Group R-3 occupancies not required to be accessible units,
Type A or Type B units, the landing at an outside doorway
must not be more than 7.75 inches below the top of the thresh-
old, provided that the door, other than an outside storm or
screen door, does not swing over the landing.
䡲 Variations in elevation due to differences in finish materials,
but not more than 0.5 inch

dwelling units, have inaccessible surfaces, and are not more
than 4 inches below the finished floor level of the adjacent in-
terior space of the living unit.

DOOR HANDLES

Door handles, pulls, latches, and locks must be installed 34 inches mini-
mum and 48 inches maximum above the finished floor. Locks used only
for security purposes and not used for normal operation are allowed at any
height except for access doors or gates in barrier walls and fences that are
used to protect pools, spas and hot tubs which are allowed to have opera-
ble parts so the latch release on self-latching devices is at 54 inches maxi-
mum above the finished floor or ground, but they cannot be self-locking
devices that need a key, electronic opener, or integral combination lock. 

There are doors in certain occupancies where locks and latches are permis-
sible in places of detention or restraint and in buildings in occupancy
Group A having an occupant load of 300 or less, Groups B, F, M, and S, and
in places of religious worship. 

The main exterior of these doors are allowed to be equipped with key-
operated locking devices from the exit side as long as the locking device can
be identified as being locked. There also needs to be a sign, visible to all, 
adjacent to the door that clearly states: This Door To Remain Unlocked
When The Building Is Occupied. There is no exception to this rule! 

The sign letters are to be 1 inch high on a contrasting background. Any-
place where the doors are used in pairs, automatic flush bolts are allowed
to be used, but they need to be approved and only allowed if the door leaf
that has the automatic flush bolts has no doorknob or surface-mounted
hardware.

Doorway landings must have a width of no less than the width of
the stairway or the door, whichever is greatest. Doors in a fully open
position must not reduce the landing to less than one-half its
required width. Landings must have a length measured in the
direction of travel of no less than 44 inches. One exception to this
code is that the landing length in the direction of travel in Groups R-
3 and U and within individual units of Group R-2 does not have to
be more than 36 inches.

CHAPTER 6

Doors that are individual dwelling or sleeping units in Group R occupan-
cies with an occupant load of 10 or less are permitted to be equipped with
a night latch, dead bolt, or security chain, but only if they are able to be
open from the inside without using a key or tool. 

STAIRWAYS

Handrails with a circular cross-section must have an outside diameter of at
least 1.25 inches, but no greater than 2 inches or must provide equivalent
graspability. If the handrail is not circular, it must have a perimeter dimen-
sion of at least 4 inches and not greater than 6.25 inches with a maximum
cross-section dimension of 2.25 inches. The maximum radius of edges
must be 0.01 inch. Generally speaking, handrail-gripping surfaces must be
continuous, without interruption by newel posts or other obstructions. 

The code states that the width of stairways cannot be less than 44 inches.
There are a few exceptions to this as follows:

䡲 Stairways that serve an occupant load of less than 50 must have
a width of no less than 36 inches.
䡲 Where an incline platform lift or stairway chairlift is installed
on stairways that serve occupancies in Group R-3, or within
dwelling units in occupancies Group R-2, a clear passage width
of no less than 20 inches must be provided. If the seat and plat-
form can be folded when not in use, the distance can be meas-
ured from the folded position.

All stairways must have a minimum headroom clearance of 80 inches. This
has to be measured vertically from a line connecting the edge of the nos-
ings. The headroom has to be continuous from above the stairway to the
point where the line intersects the landing below, one tread depth beyond
the bottom riser. Note, however, that spiral stairways, while complying
with this section, are allowed to have a 78-inch headroom clearance.

Stair tread depths have a minimum requirement of 11 inches. Riser heights
are measured vertically between the leading edges of adjacent treads and
the tread depth is to be measured horizontally between the vertical planes
of the primary projection of adjacent treads and at a right angle to the

tread’s leading edge. Winders also have a minimum tread depth which is
11 inches that are measured at a right angle to the tread’s leading edge at a
point 12 inches from the side where the treads are narrower and a mini-
mum tread depth of 10 inches. It’s important for these measurements to be
absolutely accurate. Any difference can make the stairways too steep; ap-
pear too high or even too long. 

Alternating tread devices, spiral stairways, and aisle stairs are a few excep-
tions, and are discussed later in this chapter. However, in Group R-3 occu-
pancies, within dwelling units in Group R-2 occupancies, and in Group U
occupancies that are accessory to a Group R-3 occupancy or accessory to in-
dividual dwelling units in Group R-2 occupancies the maximum riser height
is 7.75 inches. The maximum winder tread depth at the walk line must be 10
inches and the minimum winder tread depth is 6 inches. A nosing no less
than 0.75 inch, but not more than 1.25 inches must be provided on stairways
with solid risers where the tread depth is less than 11 inches. These measure-
ments are exact and there are no exceptions. The tolerance between the
largest and smallest riser height or between the largest and smallest tread
depth must not be more than 0.375 inch in any flight of stairs. 

The greatest winder tread depth at the 12-inch walk line within any flight
of stairs must not exceed the smallest by more than 0.375 inch measured at
a right angle to the tread’s leading edge. Where the bottom or top riser ad-
joins a sloping public way, walkway, or driveway having an established
grade and serving as a landing, the bottom or top riser is permitted to be
reduced along the slope to less than 4 inches in height, with the variation

142

CHAPTER 6

in height of the bottom or top riser not to exceed one unit vertical in 12
units horizontal (8-percent slope) of stairway width. 

The nosings or leading edges of treads at such non-uniform height risers
must have a distinctive marking stripe, different from any other nosing
marking provided on the stair flight. The distinctive marking stripe must
be visible in descent of the stair and must have a slip-resistant surface. Any
marking strip must be at least 1 inch wide, but no wider than 2 inches. 

Stairway landings must be found at the top and the bottom of each stair-
way, and the width of such landing cannot be less than the width of the
stairway. Every landing must have a minimum dimension measured in the
direction of travel equal to the width of the stairway. This dimension does
not need to be more than 48 inches where the stairway has a straight run.
Please see the following items of exceptions:

䡲 Aisle stairs complying with this chapter
䡲 Doors opening onto a landing cannot reduce the landing to
less than one-half the required width. When fully open, the
door must not project more than 7 inches into a landing.

The stairway walking surface of treads and landings of a stairway cannot be
sloped steeper than one unit vertical in 48 units horizontal in any direction.
Stairway treads and landing must have a solid surface and finish floor sur-
faces must be securely attached. The exception is in Groups F, H, and S 
occupancies, other than areas of parking structures accessible to the pub-
lic, openings in treads and landings will not be prohibited provided a
sphere with a diameter of 1.125 inches cannot pass through the opening. 

All outdoor stairways and outdoor approaches to stairways must be de-
signed so that water will not accumulate on walking surfaces. Enclosures
under these stairways such as walls and soffits must be protected by one-
hour fire-resistance-rated construction or the fire-resistance rating of the
stairway enclosure, whichever is greater. Access to the enclosed space can-
not be directly from within the stair enclosure, however, spaces under
stairways serving and constrained within a single residential dwelling unit
in Group R-2 or R-3 are permitted to be protected on the enclosed side
with 0.5-inch gypsum board.

Wood handrails are permitted for all types of construction.

There will be no enclosed usable space under exterior exit stairways unless
the space is completely enclosed in one-hour fire-resistance-rated con-
struction. The open space under exterior stairways will not be used for any
purpose.

A flight of stairs cannot have a vertical rise greater than 12 feet between
floor levels or landings, except for aisle stairs that comply with this code. I
said earlier that spiral stairways cannot be used as a component in the
means of egress. There are a couple of instances in which they are allowed
to be used, and they are as follows:

䡲 Spiral stairways are permitted to be used as a component in the
means of egress only within dwelling units or from a space no
more than 250 square feet in area and serving no more than
five occupants, or from galleries, catwalks, and gridirons in ac-
cordance with code. 
䡲 When a spiral stairway is allowed, there are provisions that
must be followed. A spiral stairway must have a 7.5 inch min-
imum clear tread depth at a point 12 inches from the narrow
edge. The risers must be sufficient to provide headroom of 78
inches minimum, but riser height cannot be more than 9.5
inches and the minimum stairway width must be 26 inches. 

Stairways must have handrails on each side and must comply with this chapter.
The following list contains the five exceptions for handrails:

䡲 Aisle stairs complying with this code provided with a center
handrail do not need additional handrails.
䡲 Stairways within dwelling units, spiral stairways, and aisle
stairs serving seating only on one side are permitted to have a
handrail on one side only.

144

CHAPTER 6

䡲 Decks, patios, and walkways that have a single change in eleva-
tion where the landing depth on each side of the change of el-
evation is greater than what is required for a landing do not re-
quire handrails.
䡲 In Group R-3 occupancies, a change in elevations consisting of
a single riser at an entrance or egress door does not require
handrails.
䡲 Changes in room elevations of only one riser within dwelling
and sleeping units in Group R-2 and R-3 occupancies do not
require handrails.

If your building or structure has four or more stories in height above grade
plane, one stairway must extend to the roof surface, unless the roof has a
slope steeper than four units vertical in 12 units horizontal (33-percent
slope). In buildings without an occupied roof, access to the roof from the
top story must be permitted to be by an alternating tread device. 

RAMPS

When you hear the word ramp, many different definitions may come to
mind. In this section the definition will be as follows:

The provisions of this section apply to ramps used as a component of a
means of egress. Please see the list of exceptions below:

䡲 Other than ramps that are part of the accessible routes provid-
ing access or ramped aisles within assembly rooms
䡲 Curb ramps must comply with ICC A117.1
䡲 Vehicle ramps in parking garages for pedestrian exit access do
not have to comply with this section when they are not an ac-
cessible route serving accessible parking spaces, other required
accessible elements, or part of an accessible means of egress.

Ramps that are used as part of a means of egress must have a running slope
no steeper than one unit straight up and 12 units across. The slope of the
other pedestrian ramps cannot be steeper than one unit straight up in eight
units horizontal, except for an aisle ramp in occupancies of Group A.

Ramps must have landings at the bottom of each ramp, points of turning,
entrance, exits, and at doors. The slope of a ramp’s landing cannot be
steeper than one unit, vertically, or a 2-percent slope in any direction.
Changes in these levels are not permitted. 

EXIT SIGNS

All exits and exit access doors have to be marked by an approved exit that
can be seen from any direction, so whether you are walking from the south
or north of the building, the exit sign is readable from both directions.
Where you place your exit sign is very important and the sign must be
placed in an area so that no point in a corridor is more than 100 feet, or the
viewing distance for the sign, from the nearest visible exit area.

䡲 Exit signs are not required in rooms or areas that require only
one exit or exit access.
䡲 Main exterior exit doors or gates that are obviously and clearly
identifiable as exits need not have exit signs where approved by
a building official.
䡲 Exit signs are not required in occupancies in Group U and indi-
vidual sleeping units or dwelling units in Group R-1, R-2, or R-3.
䡲 Exit signs are not required in sleeping areas in occupancies in
Group I-3.
䡲 In occupancies in Groups A-4 and A-5, exit signs are not re-
quired on the seating side of a stadium or theaters or openings
into seating areas where exit signs are provided in the con-
course that are readily apparent from the stadium or theater
within the seating area in an emergency.

146

CHAPTER 6

Every sign, including directional signs, must have legible letters without
decoration. Letters must be at least 6 inches high, and no less than 0.75 inch
wide; less than this is against the code. And there is even a rule for spacing
between letters which may not be less than 0.375 inch. Larger signs must
have letter widths and spacing in proportion to their height.

HANDRAILS

The code for handrail extensions has changed from the previous code. Ac-
cording to the current International Building Code stair risers have a max-
imum height requirement of 7 inches and a minimum of 4 inches. What
good are stairways and ramps without handrails? According to the 2009 In-
ternational Building Code a handrail is defined as a horizontal or sloping
rail intended for grasping by the hand for guidance or support. Handrails
must be sufficiently attached and adequate in strength and be no less than
34 inches, but not more than 38 inches. 

Handrail height is to be measured from above the stair tread nosing. When
used on ramps handrail height is measured from the surface of the ramp
slope. Some handrails have a circular cross-section and must have an out-
side diameter of at least 1.25 inches, but not greater than 2 inches or must
be able to be grasped easily. If the handrail is not circular, it must have a
perimeter dimension of at least 4 inches, but not greater than 6.25 inches
with a maximum cross-section dimension of 2.25 inches. Any edge has to
have a minimum radius of 0.01 inch. Gripping surfaces of all handrails is
to be continuous, without interruption by newel posts or any other ob-
struction. The following are exceptions:

䡲 Handrails within dwelling units are permitted to be inter-
rupted by a newel post at a stair landing.
䡲 A volute, turnout, or starting ease is allowed on the lowest
tread in houses only.
䡲 Handrail brackets or balusters that are attached to the bottom
surface of the handrail that do not hang over the sides of the
handrail within 1.5 inches are not considered obstructions.

There must be a clear space between a handrail and a wall or other surface
that must be at least 1.5 inches. Keep handrails, walls, or other surfaces ad-

jacent to the handrail free of any sharp or abrasive elements, as not doing
so is a violation of this code. As with handrails, ramps are required to have
a minimum space between rails and the wall and must be at least 36 inches.
Also please note that projections into the required width of stairways and
ramps cannot be more than 4.5 inches at or below the handrail height.

GUARDS

A guard is a building component or a system of building components lo-
cated at or near the open sides of elevated walking surfaces that minimizes
the possibility of a fall from the walking surface to a lower level. Guards
must be placed along the sides of stairways, ramps, and landings that are
more than 30 inches above the floor or grade below where the glazing does
not meet strength requirements. There are places where guards are not re-
quired, including:

䡲 On the loading side of docks or piers
䡲 On the side of stages (from the audience side), and raised plat-
forms, including steps leading up to the stage and raised platforms
䡲 At vertical openings in the performance area of stages and platforms
䡲 At elevated walking surfaces attached to stages and platforms pro-
viding access to and utilization of special lighting or equipment
䡲 Along vehicle service pits not accessible to the public
䡲 In assemble seating where guards in accordance with this
chapter are permitted and provided.

Guards are used as a protective barrier, but the purpose is defeated if the
barriers are not of a certain height. According to the code, a guard cannot

148

CHAPTER 6

be less than 42 inches high, and must be measured vertically above the
leading edge of the tread, next to the walking surface or beside a seat. How-
ever, for those occupancies in Group R-3, and within individual housing
units in occupancies in Group R-2, guards whose top rail also serves as a
handrail must have a height of no less than 34 and no more than 38 inches,
also measured vertically from the leading edge of the stair tread and nose. 

The height in assembly seating areas must be in accordance with this chap-
ter. Guards are in play to prevent you, clients, customers, and the people
close to you from getting hurt. Therefore, guards must be installed in
screen porches and decks where the walking surface is more than 30 inches
above the floor or grade below. These decks and screen porches are of the
types that are screened in to prevent insect invasion. 

Any component of mechanical equipment that requires service, such as ap-
pliances, equipment, fans, or roof hatch openings, that are located within
10 feet of a roof edge or open side of a walking surface and the edge or open
side is more than 30 inches above the floor or roof require the installation
of a guard that prevents the passage of a 21-inch object. 

EXIT ACCESS

An exit access is the part of the means of egress or exit system that leads
from any occupied portion of a building or structure to an exit. This can
be an aisle or a hallway or other means of a walkway. Egress or throughway
cannot pass through rooms that are of high hazard occupancy unless the
adjoining rooms are accessory to the area and in Groups H, S, or F occu-
pancy when the adjoining or intervening rooms or spaces are the same or
an occupancy group that is less hazardous.

An exit cannot pass through kitchens, storage rooms, closets, or other
spaces that are used for similar purposes. Keep in mind that an exit egress

MEANS OF EGRESS

149

is not allowed to pass through a room that can be locked or lead through
bedrooms or bathrooms. Speaking of dwellings, when more than one ten-
ant lives on any one floor of a building or structure, each tenant space,
dwelling, or sleeping unit must be provided with access to the required ex-
its in a clear aisle that does not pass through another tenant unit. 

In Group I-2 occupancies, such as hospitals or nursing facilities, rooms or
suites must have an exit access door that leads directly to a corridor. The
following are exceptions:

䡲 Rooms with exits doors that lead or open directly to the out-
side at the ground level
䡲 Patient sleeping rooms are permitted to have one intervening
room if that room is not used as an exit access for more than
eight patients.
䡲 Special nursing suites are allowed to have one intervening
room if they allow direct and constant (visual) supervision by
nursing personnel.
䡲 Any room that is not located in a suite where the travel dis-
tance is not greater than 100 feet is allowed to have exit travel.

Other occupancies other than Groups H-1, H-2, and H-3, the common
path of egress or exit travel is not allowed to be more than 75 feet, but
Groups H-1, H-2, and H-3 cannot have a common path of egress travel
of more than 25 feet. In Group B, F, and S occupancies exit travel can-
not be more than 100 feet, and that is only if the building is equipped
with an automatic sprinkler system. Say your tenant space, which is con-
sidered a Group B, S, or U occupancy, has an occupant load of not more
than 30 people, the length of a common path travel cannot be more than
100 feet. 

If your building or structure is of Group I-3 occupancy, the path of travel
is limited to 100 feet. And finally, the length of a common path travel in
Group R-2 occupancy cannot be more than 125 feet provided you have
installed an automatic sprinkler system throughout. Always remember
that any automatic sprinkler systems must be installed in accordance with
this code.

Aisle: An exit access component that defines and provides a path of
egress travel.

Aisles

Aisles that serve as part of the exit access in the means of egress or exit sys-
tem must comply with this next section. Aisles must be provided from all
occupied parts of the exit access which contain seats, tables, furnishings,
displays, and similar fixtures or equipment. The required width of aisles
must be unobstructed. Doors, however, when fully opened, and handrails
must not reduce width by more than 7 inches. And, doors in any position
must not reduce the required width by more than one-half. Other projec-
tions such as trim and similar decorative features are allowed to project
into the required width of 1.5 from each side. 

For Group M occupancies where seating is located at a table or counter and
is adjacent to an aisle or aisle accessway, the measurement must be made
to a line of at least 19 inches. This must be measured from the edge of the
table or counter. In the case of other side boundaries for aisle or aisle ac-
cessways, the clear width must be measured to walls, edges of seating, and
tread edges, except that handrail projections are permitted. 

If tables or counters have fixed seating, meaning the seats are bolted to the
floor, the width of the aisle accessway must be measured from the back of
the chair. Table and seating accessways are required to have a minimum of
12 inches of width plus 0.5 inch of width for each additional foot. The ex-
ception to this is parts of aisle accessways having a length that is not more
than 6 feet and used by no more than four people. Balconies used for egress
purposes have to conform to the same requirements as corridors as well.

EXIT AND EXIT ACCESS DOORWAYS

Requirements for the number of exits and exit access doorways are depen-
dant upon a number of details in regard to occupancy.

MEANS OF EGRESS

151

All required exits must be located in such a way that makes their use obvi-
ous. Both interior exit stairways and ramps must be enclosed with fire bar-
riers or horizontal assemblies that comply with the code book. The fire-re-
sistance rating of no less than two hours is required when the unit is four
stories or more, or no less than one hour when the unit is less than four sto-
ries. Be sure to include basements in this calculation, but not mezzanines.
Although obvious, an exit enclosure cannot be used for any purpose other
than a means of egress. The exceptions for this are numerous and include:

䡲 In all occupancies, other than Group H and I, and stairway is
not required to be enclosed when the stairway serves an occu-
pant load of less than 10 and the stairway complies with either
Item 1.1 or 1.2. In all cases however, the maximum number of
connecting open stories cannot not be more than two.
– 1.1 The stairway is open to not more than one story above
the story at the level of exit discharge; or
– 1.2 The stairway is open to not more than one story below
the story at the level of exit discharge.
䡲 Exits in buildings of Group A-5 where all portions of the
means of egress are essentially open to the outside need not be
enclosed.
䡲 Stairways that are used and contained in a single residential
dwelling or sleeping unit in Group R-1, R-2, or R-3 occupan-
cies are not required to be enclosed.
䡲 Stairways that are not a required means of egress element are
not always required to be enclosed.
䡲 Stairways in open parking structures that serve only the park-
ing structure are not required to be enclosed.
䡲 Stairways in Group I-3 occupancies and means of egress stair-
ways are not required to be enclosed.
䡲 In groups other than Group H and Group I occupancies, a
maximum of 50 percent of egress stairways serving one adja-
cent floor are not required to be enclosed, provided at least two
means of egress are provided from both floors that are using
the open stairways. And, any floors that are interconnected
cannot be open to other floors.

152

CHAPTER 6

䡲 In groups other than Group H and I occupancies, inside stair-
way exits that provide service for the first and second stories of
a building that has an automatic sprinkler system throughout
are not required to be enclosed, but only if there are at least two
means of exits. These interconnected floors cannot be open to
other stories.

Any penetrations into and any openings through an exit enclosure are not
allowed except for required exit doors, equipment, and ductwork that is
necessary for independent pressurization, sprinkler piping, standpipes,
electrical raceway serving the exit enclosure and terminating at a steel box
that is not more than 16 square inches. Such penetrations must be pro-
tected. There must not be any penetrations or communication openings,
whether protected or not, between adjacent exit enclosures. Equipment
and ductwork for exit enclosure ventilation as allowed by this chapter must
meet one of the following terms:

䡲 All equipment and ductwork has to be located outside of the
building and must be directly connected to the exit enclosure
by ductwork enclosed in construction as required by shafts.
䡲 Where the equipment and ductwork is located within the exit
enclosure, the intake air must be taken directly from the out-
doors and the exhaust air must be discharged directly to the
outdoors, or the air must be conveyed through ducts enclosed
in construction as required by shafts.
䡲 Where equipment and ductwork is located within the build-
ing, this equipment and ductwork must be separated from the
rest of the building, including other mechanical equipment,
with construction as required for shafts.

In each case, openings into the fire-resistance-rated construction must be
limited to those that are needed for maintenance and operation and must
be protected by opening protectives for shaft enclosures. And all exit en-
closure ventilation systems must be independent of other building ventila-
tion systems.

The outside walls of an exit enclosure must comply with the requirements
for exterior walls. In cases where non-rated walls or unprotected openings

enclose the outside of the stairway and the walls or openings are exposed
by other parts of the building at an angle of less than 180 degrees, the out-
side building walls within 10 feet horizontally of a non-rated wall or un-
protected opening must have a fire-resistance rating of no less than one
hour. And as a reminder, openings within inside walls have to be protected
by opening protectives that have a fire protection rating of no less than ¾
hour. This type of construction is to extend vertically—from the ground to
a point that is 10 feet—above the uppermost landing of the stairway or to
the roof line, but make sure that is the lowest level. 

FLOOR NUMBER SIGNS

All floor landings in every inside exit enclosure that connects more than
three stories must have a sign. These signs must identify the floor level and
the direction to the exit of that stairway. It must also include the availabil-
ity of the roof access from the stairway for the fire department, and is to be
located 5 feet above the floor landing in such a position that is visible when
the doors are in the open and closed positions.

SMOKEPROOF ENCLOSURES 

A smokeproof enclosure or pressurized stairway must exit into a public
space or into an exit passageway, yard, or open space. Any of these must
have direct access to a public area. An exit passageway must have no other
openings and be separated from the remainder of the building by two-hour
fire-resistance-rated construction. The following is a list of exceptions:

䡲 Openings in the exit passageway that serves a smokeproof enclo-
sure are allowed where the exit passageway is protected and pres-
surized in the same manner as the smokeproof enclosure, and
openings are protected as required for access from other floors.

154

CHAPTER 6

䡲 Openings in the exit passageway serving a pressurized stairway
are permitted where the exit passageway is protected and pres-
surized in the same manner as the pressurized stairway.
䡲 A smokeproof enclosure or pressurized stairway must be al-
lowed to pass through areas on the level of discharge or
vestibules as allowed by this chapter.

The access to this stairway must be through an entrance hall or an open
balcony, unless there is a pressurized stairway.

HORIZONTAL EXITS

A horizontal exit cannot serve as the only exit from a portion of a building.
In buildings where two or more exits are required, not more than one-half
of the total number of exits can be horizontal exits. However, if your build-
ing is of Group I-2 occupancy, horizontal exits are permitted to make up
two-thirds of the required exits. 

In Group I-3 occupancies, horizontal exits are allowed to make up 100 per-
cent of the exits required. There must at least 6 square feet of accessible
space per occupant on each side of the exit for the total number of people
in adjoining compartments. Horizontal exits that connect separation of
buildings or refuge areas must provide a fire wall or a fire barrier; both
complying with the code and having a fire-resistance rating of no less two
hours. Such exit separation must extend vertically through all levels of the
building unless the floor assemblies have a fire-resistance rating of no less
than two hours with all openings having a protective element. The excep-
tion being that a fire-resistance rating is not required at horizontal exits be-

155

tween a building area and an above-grade pedestrian walkway. The walk-
way has to provide a distance of more than 20 feet and must comply with
Special Construction. 

Horizontal exits that contain a refuge area must be a space occupied by the
same tenant or public area and each refuge area has to be big enough to ac-
commodate the original occupant load plus any extra people from the ad-
joining compartment. The anticipated occupant load from the adjoining
compartment is based on the capacity of the horizontal exit doors that en-
ter the refuge area. The net floor area allowable per occupancies must be as
follows for the indicated occupancies:

䡲 Six square feet per occupant for occupancies in Group I-3
䡲 Fifteen square feet per occupant for ambulatory occupancies
and 30 square feet per occupant in non-ambulatory occupan-
cies in Group I-2.

EXTERIOR EXIT RAMPS AND STAIRWAYS

If a building or structure includes outside exit ramps and stairways that are
used as part of a required means of door or way of exit, pay close attention
to this section as it pertains to such ramps and stairways. If your building
or structure is of Group I-2 occupancy, you may not use exterior ramps
and stairways as an element of a means of exit. 

All exterior exit ramps and stairways must have at least one open side and
have a minimum of 35 square feet of total open area bordering each floor
level and the level of each intermediate landing. Take note that the required
open area must be located on less than 42 inches above the bordering floor
or landing level. 

These types of ramps and stairways have to be separated from the inside of
the building. Remember, any opening is limited to those necessary for exit
from spaces that are normally occupied. However, there are several excep-
tions to this listed below:

䡲 Separation from the interior of the building is not required for
occupancies, other than those in Group R-1 or R-2, in build-
ings that are no more than two stories above grade plane where
the level of exit discharge is the first story above grade plane.

156

CHAPTER 6

䡲 Separation from the interior of the building is not required
where the exterior ramp or stairway is served by an exterior
ramp and/or balcony that connects two remote outside stair-
ways or other approved exits with a perimeter that is no less
than 50 percent open. For the opening to be considered open,
it must be a minimum of 50 percent of the height of the enclos-
ing wall, with the top of the openings less than 7 feet above the
top of the balcony.
䡲 Separation from the inside of the building is not required for
an inside ramp or stairway located in a building or structure
that is allowed to have unenclosed inside stairways in accor-
dance with the chapter.
䡲 Separation from the inside of the building is not required for
exterior ramps or stairways connected to open-ended corri-
dors, provided that these items are met: the building, which in-
cludes corridors and ramps and/or stairs, must be thoroughly
equipped with an automatic sprinkler system. The open-ended
corridors are connected on each end to an outside exit ramp or
stairway and comply with this chapter.
䡲 At any location in an open-ended corridor where a change of
direction exceeds 45 degrees, a clear opening of no less than 35
square feet or an outside ramp or stairway is provided. If/when
clear openings are provided, they must be located so the accu-
mulation of smoke or toxic gases is minimized.

EMERGENCY ESCAPE AND RESCUE 

Basements and sleeping rooms that are located below the fourth story
above grade plane must have at least one outside emergency escape and
rescue opening. If a basement contains one or more bedrooms, emergency
egress and openings are required for each bedroom, but are not required
in adjoining areas of a basement. Exceptions include the following:

䡲 Occupancies other than Group R-3 equipped throughout with
an approved automatic sprinkler system.
䡲 Occupancies other than Group R-3 that have rooms used for
sleeping and have a door that leads to a fire-resistance-rated cor-
ridor that has access to two remote exits in opposite directions.

Emergency escape: The code defines an emergency escape as an
operable window, door, or other device that provides for means of
escape and access for rescue in the event of an emergency.

䡲 The emergency escape and rescue opening is permitted to
open onto a balcony, provided the balcony provides access to
an exit and the dwelling or sleeping unit has an exit that does
not open to an atrium.
䡲 Basements that have a ceiling height of less than 80 inches or
basements without habitable space and having no more than
200 square feet in floor area are not required to have an emer-
gency escape and rescue windows.
䡲 High-rise buildings with exceptions.

All emergency escape and rescue openings must have a minimum net clear
opening of 5.7 square feet, except for grade-floor openings, which must be
at least 5 square feet, and both requiring a minimum height of 24 inches
and width of 20 inches. The maximum height from the floor in all cases is
to be no greater than 44 inches measured from the floor. Keep in mind that
all the emergency openings do not mean a thing if they do not work right
or cannot be opened from the inside. You can place bars, grilles, or grates
over the escape, but they must be removable from the inside without the
use of any tool or key. If you choose to install any of the above on an emer-
gency escape you must also have smoke alarms installed as well. 

In conclusion of this chapter, it is important that you realize that these pro-
visions are in play for a number of reasons, with safety being one of the
most important. As with any chapter of this book, any questions can be ad-
dressed to your local code office or building inspector for clarity.

Accessibility

This chapter examines the design and construction of buildings to be ac-
cessible to physically disabled persons. All buildings and facilities are to be
designed and constructed to be accessible with this code and ICC A117.1.
I have included definition alerts and tables for added information. Do not
assume that the code is the same from previous code books—there have
been changes and it is your responsibility to be aware of such changes.

SCOPING REQUIREMENTS

The following list covers places and sites where accessibility is required:

䡲 Employee work areas must be designed and constructed so
that individuals with disabilities can approach, enter, and exit
the work area. 
䡲 Work areas or portions of that are less than 150 square feet in
area and are elevated 7 inches or more above the ground or fin-
ish floor are exempt from all requirements, provided that the
elevation is essential to the function of that space.

Accessible: A site, building, facility, or portion thereof that complies
with this chapter.

䡲 Walk-in coolers and freezers intended for employee use only
are not required to be accessible.
䡲 Occupancies in Group U are exempt from the requirements of
this chapter other than the following: in agricultural buildings,
access is required to paved work areas and areas open to the
general public, private garages or carports that contain re-
quired accessible parking.
䡲 In buildings where a day care facility (Groups A-3, E, I-4, and
R-3) is part of a dwelling unit, only the portion of the structure
used for the day care facility is required to be accessible. 
䡲 The operable parts of fuel-dispensing devices must comply
with ICC A177.1, Section 308.2.1 or 308.3.1.

The next list contains sites and places where accessibility is not required.
This list and the one above are general lists of sites and places only. They
are not intended to take the place of accessibility codes required for routes,
entrances, and other requirements that will follow this section.

䡲 Detached one-and two-family dwellings and accessory struc-
tures, and their associated sites and facilities, are not required
to be accessible.
䡲 Construction sites, structures, and equipment directly associ-
ated with the actual processes of construction including, but
not limited to, scaffolding, bridging, materials, hoists, or con-
struction trailers are not required to be accessible.
䡲 Raised areas used primarily for purposes of security, life safety,
or fire safety including, but not limited to, observation galleries,
prison guard towers, fire towers, or lifeguard stands are not re-
quired to be accessible or to be served by an accessible route.

ACCESSIBILITY

161

䡲 Limited access spaces such as non-occupiable spaces accessed
only by ladders, catwalks, crawl spaces, freight elevators, or
very narrow passageways are not required to be accessible. This
includes, but is not limited to, spaces frequented only by per-
sonnel for maintenance, repair, or monitoring of equipment
such as elevator pits, water or sewage treatment pump rooms.
䡲 Single-occupant structures accessed only by passageways be-
low grade or elevated above grade including, but not limited
to, toll booths that are accessed only by underground tunnels
are not required to be accessible.
䡲 Buildings of Group R-1 containing not more than five sleeping
units for rent or hire that are also occupied as the residence of
the proprietor are not required to be accessible.
䡲 In detention and correctional facilities, common use areas that
are used only by inmates or detainees and security personnel,
and that do not serve holding cells or housing cells required to
be accessible, are not required to be accessible or to be served
by an accessible route.

ACCESSIBLE ROUTE

Accessible routes within the site must be provided from public transporta-
tion stops, accessible parking areas, accessible passenger loading zones, and
public streets or sidewalks to the building’s accessible entrance being used.
Other than buildings or facilities serving Type B units, an accessible route
is not required between site arrival points and the building or facility en-
trance if the only means of access between them is a vehicular way not pro-
viding for pedestrian access.

When a building or portion of a building is required to be accessible, an ac-
cessible route must be provided to each portion of the building, to accessi-

ble building entrances that connect each accessible pedestrian walkways,
and the public way. However, in assembly areas with fixed seating required
to be accessible, an accessible route is not required to serve fixed seating
where wheelchair spaces or designated aisle seats required on an accessible
route are not provided. 

When discussing connected areas and walkways this includes employee
work areas, which must have common use circulation paths within such
work areas that must be accessible routes. See the following list of excep-
tions for common use circulation paths:

䡲 Any path located within work areas that are less than 300
square feet and have definite installed partitions, counters,
casework, or furniture is not required to be an accessible route.
䡲 Any paths that are an integral component of equipment are
not required to be accessible routes.
䡲 Work areas that are fully exposed to the weather are not re-
quired to be accessible routes.

An accessible route is not required to stories and mezzanines above and be-
low accessible levels that have a total area of not more than 3000 square
feet. This exception does not apply to the following:

䡲 Multiple tenant facilities of Group M occupancies containing
five or more tenant spaces
䡲 Levels containing offices of health care providers
䡲 Passenger transportation facilities and airports, which are
Group A-3 or B.

In Groups A, I, R, and S occupancies, levels that do not contain accessible
elements or other spaces as required by this chapter are not required to be

served by an accessible route from an accessible level. If your building is an
air traffic control tower or a two-story building that has an occupant load
of five or less people (as long as it does not contain public areas) you are
not required to have an accessible route.

Accessible routes must happen together with or be located in the same area
as a general circulation path. Where the circulation path is inside, the ac-
cessible path must be inside as well. If you have only one accessible route
in a building, it cannot pass through kitchens, storage rooms, restrooms,
closets, or similar spaces. 

Accessible routes that are from parking garages and serve Type B dwelling
units are not required to be located inside. If you have installed security bar-
riers such as security posts and security check points, they are not allowed to
obstruct a required accessible route or accessible means of egress. If the secu-
rity barriers incorporate elements that cannot comply with these 
requirements, such as certain metal detectors or other similar devices, the ac-
cessible route will be allowed to provide adjacent security screening devices.

Any persons with disabilities who have to pass through one of these devices
must be able to maintain visual contact with their belongings to the same
extent as others do. One example of where this rule might apply is at an air-
port security checkpoint when baggage is being checked while going
through an x-ray machine. People with disabilities must be able to have the
same ability as others to watch their belongings pass through.

ACCESSIBLE ENTRANCES

In addition to the provisions in this chapter regarding accessible entrances,
at least 60 percent of all public entrances must be accessible. This does not
apply to areas that are not required to be accessible and loading and serv-

䡲 Parking garage entrances—Direct access for pedestrians from
parking structures to buildings or facility entrances must be
accessible.
䡲 Entrances from tunnels or elevated walkways—If direct access
is provided for pedestrians from a tunnel or elevated walkway
to a building or facility, at least one entrance from each tunnel
or walkway must be accessible.
䡲 Restricted entrances—In situations where restricted entrances
are provided to a building or facility, at least one restricted en-
trance to the building must be accessible.
䡲 Entrances for inmates or detainees—Buildings with entrances
used only by inmates or detainees and security personnel at ju-
dicial facilities, detention facilities, or correctional facilities,
must have at least one entrance that is accessible.
䡲 Service entrances—If a service entrance is the only entrance to
a building or a tenant space in a facility, that entrance must be
accessible.
䡲 Tenant spaces, dwelling units, and sleeping units—At least
one accessible entrance must be provided to each tenant,
dwelling unit, and sleeping unit in a facility, except for the
following: an accessible entrance is not required for tenant
spaces that are not required to be accessible and an accessible
entrance is not required for dwelling units and sleeping units
that are not required to be accessible units, Type A units or

PARKING AND PASSENGER LOADING FACILITIES

For buildings and structures that provide parking, accessible parking
spaces must be provided. In cases where more than one parking facility is
provided on a site, the number of parking spaces required to be accessible
must be calculated separately for each parking facility. Note that this sec-
tion does not apply to parking spaces that are used exclusively for buses,
trucks, other delivery vehicles, law enforcement, or motor pools where lots
accessed by the public are provided with an accessible passenger loading
zone. The next paragraphs provides detailed information regarding the
percentages that different groups or facilities must provide for parking.

For Groups R-2 and R-3, 2 percent, but not less than 1 percent, of each type
of parking space provided for occupancies are required to have accessible
parking. Type A or B dwelling or sleeping units must be accessible. In loca-
tions where parking is provided within or beneath a building, accessible
parking spaces must also be provided within or beneath the building. Hos-
pital outpatient facilities must provide 10 percent of accessible patient and
visitor parking spaces for hospital outpatient facilities. For rehabilitation fa-
cilities and outpatient physical therapy facilities, 20 percent, and not less than
one, of the portion of patient and visitor parking spaces must be accessible.

A percentage of accessible parking spaces must be dedicated to van-acces-
sible parking. At least one must be a van-accessible parking space. For
every accessible parking space, there are provisions regarding the location
of these spaces. Accessible parking spaces must be located on the shortest
accessible travel route from adjacent parking to an accessible building en-
trance. For parking facilities that are not provided for any particular build-
ing, accessible parking spaces must also be located on the shortest route to
an accessible pedestrian entrance. For buildings that have multiple accessi-

ble entrances with adjacent parking, accessible parking spaces must be dis-
persed and located near the accessible entrances. Pay attention to the fol-
lowing exceptions:

䡲 In multilevel parking structures, van-accessible parking spaces
are permitted on one level.
䡲 Accessible parking spaces are allowed to be located in different
parking facilities if substantially equal or greater accessibility is
provided in terms of distance from an accessible entrance or
entrances, parking fee, and user convenience.

DWELLING UNITS AND SLEEPING UNITS

In addition to the other requirements of this chapter, occupancies having
dwelling or sleeping units must be provided with accessible features in ac-
cordance with this section. Dwelling and sleeping units that are required to
be accessible units and Type A and B units must comply with the applica-
ble portions of ICC A117.1. Rooms and spaces that are used by the general
public or available for use by residents must be accessible. Some examples
of these rooms or spaces are:

䡲 Bathrooms
䡲 Kitchens
䡲 Living and dining rooms
䡲 Patios
䡲 Terraces and balconies.

This list of required rooms does not include recreational facilities in accor-
dance with this chapter. The primary entrance of each of these accessible
units, not rooms, must have at least one accessible route connecting the
building or facility entrances. However, sometimes there are circum-

stances beyond your control. Say that either the slope of the finished
ground level between the accessible facility and the building is more than
one vertical unit in 12 or if physical barriers or legal restrictions prevent the
installation of an accessible route. You are allowed, in accordance with the
International Building Code, to install a vehicular route (with parking that
complies with this chapter) at each public or common used facility or
building in place of the accessible route. 

The next section, although brief, is in regards to Group I occupancies.
There have been a number of changes for this category that you need to be
aware of: At least 4 percent, but not less than one, of the dwelling and sleep-
ing units must be accessible units. Group I-1 structures of Type B units
that contain four or more dwelling or sleeping units intended to be occu-
pied as a residence, must be accessible, and the number of Type B units is
allowed to be reduced in accordance with this chapter. Group I-2 occupan-
cies, nursing homes, must have at least 50 percent (but not less than one)
accessible and Type B units. Accessible and Type B units must be provided
for Group I-2, which include the following:

䡲 General-purpose hospitals
䡲 Psychiatric facilities
䡲 Detoxification facilities
䡲 Residential care/assisted living facilities.

Of all the dwelling and sleeping units in these facilities, at least 10 percent,
again, no less than one, must be accessible units. For structures with four
or more dwelling or sleeping units with the intention to be occupied as a
residence, every unit must be a Type B occupancy. However, the number
of Type B units is permitted to be reduced in accordance with this chapter.

Group I-2 is classified as hospitals and rehabilitation facilities. These facil-
ities must specialize in treating conditions that affect mobility, or include
units which specialize in such treatment, and 100 percent of these dwelling
units must be accessible units. The above code provisions pertain to Group
I occupancies only. 

Apartment houses, monasteries, and convents belong to Group R-2. Both
Type A and B must be provided for this group. If this particular group con-
tains more than 20 percent dwelling or sleeping units, at least 2 percent
must be Type A, and all units on site will need to be considered when de-
termining the total number of units. Two exceptions to this are: (1) the
number of Type A units is permitted to be reduced and (2) existing struc-
tures on a site do not have to be included when calculating the total num-
ber of units. 

In cases where there are four or more dwelling or sleeping units and they
are intended to be occupied as a residence, they must be a Type B unit.
Again, the number of Type B units is allowed to be reduced in accordance
with this chapter. Not all Group R-2 occupancies are apartment houses,
monasteries, and convents. Any other occupancy that falls under Group 
R-2 must provide accessible and Type B units. 

The required number of Type A and Type B units does not apply to a site
where the required elevation of the lowest floor or the lowest horizontal
structural building members of non-elevator buildings are at or above the
design flood elevation which results in the following:

䡲 A difference in elevation between the minimum required floor
elevation at the primary entrances and vehicular and pedes-
trian arrival points within 50 feet over 30 inches

SPECIAL OCCUPANCIES

In addition to other requirements of this chapter, the requirements of
this section must be applied to special occupancies. Theaters, bleach-
ers, grandstands, stadiums, arenas, and other fixed seating assembly
areas must provide accessible wheelchair spaces that comply also with
ICC A117.1. If such stadiums, and the like, provide audible public an-
nouncements, they must provide equivalent text information regard-
ing events and facilities. For example, places or areas that have elec-

announced over a PA system, with the exception of announcements
that cannot be pre-recorded. 

One occupancy which has provisions for accessibility is performance
areas. An accessible route must directly connect the performance area
to the assembly seating area. Self-service storage areas must provide
accessible individual self-storage space.

The final provisions for special occupancies that I want to review are
judicial facilities. Each courtroom and central holding cell must be ac-
cessible. Where separate central holding cells are provided for adult
male and juvenile males and adult and juvenile females, one of each
type must be accessible. In places where central holding cells are pro-
vided, but are not separated by age or gender, at least one accessible
cell must be provided. This is the same case for courtrooms.

CODE UPDATECODE UPDATE

In dining areas the dining surfaces for the consumption of food or
drink are to have at least 5 percent, but not less than one, designed

CHAPTER 7

OTHER FEATURES AND FACILITIES

A very important area that must adhere to the International Building Code
is bathrooms and bathing areas. Not only does this code provide for acces-
sibility, but for facilities provided for both genders. All bathrooms and
bathing facilities must be made accessible. 

Where a floor level is not required to be connected by an accessible route,
the only bathroom or bathing room provided cannot be located on the in-
accessible floor. You must provide at least one of each type of fixture, ele-
ment, control, or dispenser in each accessible bathroom/bathing room.
There are several exceptions to these provisions, including:

䡲 Bathrooms or bathing facilities accessed only through a private
office and not intended for common or public use are allowed
to have doors that swing into the clear floor space, provided
the door swing can be reversed.
䡲 The height requirements for the water closet in ICC A117.1 are
not applicable.
䡲 Grab bars are not required and the requirements for height,
knee, and toe clearance do not apply to a lavatory.
䡲 Where multiple single-user toilet rooms or bathing facilities
are clustered at a single location, at least 50 percent but not less
than one room for each use at each cluster must be accessible.

The provisions for unisex toilet rooms state that unisex toilet rooms must
include only one water closet and only one lavatory. A unisex bathing
room in accordance with this chapter will be considered a unisex toilet
room. A urinal is allowed in addition to the water closet in a unisex toilet
room. Unisex bathing rooms can include only one shower or bathtub fix-
ture and only one water closet and lavatory. An accessible route is manda-
tory and there must be no more than 500 feet from any separate-sex bath-
room to a unisex bathroom.

Exterior Walls

In this chapter you will find discussions regarding the provisions as set
forth by the International Building Code regarding the following items:

䡲 Exterior walls
䡲 Exterior wall coverings
䡲 Exterior wall openings
䡲 Exterior windows and doors
䡲 Architectural trim
䡲 Balconies and similar projections
䡲 Bay and oriel windows.

PERFORMANCE REQUIREMENTS

This section applies to exterior walls, wall coverings, and components of
such. All exterior walls need to be weather protected with a weather-resist-
ant exterior wall envelope. 

173

174

CHAPTER 8

! De f in i t iona le r t

Exterior wall envelope: A system or assembly of exterior wall
components, including exterior wall finish materials, that provides
protection of the building structural members, including framing
and sheathing material and conditioned interior space, from the
detrimental effects of the exterior environment.

An exterior wall envelope must include flashing and must be designed and
constructed in such a manner so that an accumulation of water within the
wall assembly is prevented. The envelope must provide a water-resistive
barrier behind the exterior veneer, and a way for any water that enters the
assembly to the exterior to drain. All protection against condensation in
the exterior wall assembly must be provided in accordance with the Inter-
national Energy Conservation Code. 

There are exceptions to weather protection: a weather-resistant exterior
wall envelope is not required over concrete or masonry walls that are de-
signed in accordance with code, and compliance with the requirements for
a means of drainage are not required for an exterior wall envelope that has
been tested and proven to resist wind-driven rain. This includes joints,
penetrations, and intersections with different materials, in accordance
with ASTM E 331, but only under the following conditions:

䡲 Exterior wall envelope test assemblies must include at least one
opening, one control joint, one wall/eave interface, and one
wall sill. 
䡲 All tested openings and penetrations must be representative of
the intended end-use configuration.
䡲 Exterior wall envelope assemblies must be tested at a mini-
mum differential pressure of 6.2 pounds per square foot.
䡲 Exterior wall envelope assemblies must be subjected to a min-
imum test exposure duration of two hours.

EXTERIOR WALLS

Trade Tip

Did You Know?

Fast Fact

Exterior wall design has to be considered to resist wind-driven rain
and the results of such testing have to indicate that no water could
penetrate any control joints in the wall, joints at the perimeter of
openings, or intersections of terminations with different materials.
The structural aspects of exterior walls and associated openings
must be designed in accordance with Structural Design. 

If a building or structure is in an area considered to be a flood zone, it is re-
quired that exterior walls extend below the design floor elevation and are
resistant to water damage. Wood must be treated by a pressure-preserva-
tive in accordance with AWPA U1 for the species, product, and end use us-
ing a preservative that is found in Section 4 of AWPA U1 or decay-resist-
ant heartwood of redwood, black locust, or cedar. 

MATERIALS

All materials used must be of a code-approved type. When constructing a
water-resistive barrier a minimum of one layer of asphalt felt, which must
be No. 15, complying with ASTM D 226 for Type 1 felt, or other approved
materials must be attached to the studs or sheathing. This must include
flashing. This is to provide a continuous water-resistive barrier behind the
exterior wall veneer.

Fast Fact

If you have chosen to construct exterior walls with cold-rolled
copper, the copper needs to conform to the requirements of ASTM B
370 and all lead-coated copper must conform to the requirements
of ASTM B 101.

Please refer to the following list for materials and the chapter for which
they must be in accordance with:

䡲 Concrete and glass-unit masonry: Exterior walls of concrete
construction must be designed and constructed in accordance
with code requirements.
䡲 Plastics: Plastic panel, apron, or spandrel walls as defined by
this code are not limited in thickness, provided that plastic and
their assemblies conform to code requirements and are con-
structed of approved water-resistant materials of adequate
strength to resist the wind loads for cladding.
䡲 Vinyl siding must be certified and labeled as conforming to the
requirements of ASTM D 3679 by an approved quality control
agency.
䡲 Fiber cement siding must conform to the requirements of
ASTM C 1186 and be identified on the label listing an ap-
proved quality control agency.

FLASHING

Flashing must be installed in such a manner so as to prevent moisture from
entering the wall or to redirect it to the outside. The following list contains
all of the perimeters in which flashing must be installed:

䡲 Perimeters of exterior door and window assemblies
䡲 Penetrations and terminations of exterior wall assemblies

Flashing: Pieces of sheet metal, or the like, used to reinforce and
weatherproof the joints and angles of a roof, as where a roof comes
in contact with a wall.

䡲 Exterior wall intersections with roofs, chimneys, porches,
decks, balconies, and similar projections
䡲 Built into gutters and similar locations.

Flashing with projection must be installed on both sides and the ends of
copings, under sills, and continuously above projecting trim. Moisture is
also known to build up in exterior wall pockets and even crevices of build-
ings and structures. It is crucial that these wall pockets be avoided or pro-
tected by using caps or drips. 

Flashing and weepholes must be located in the first course of masonry
above the finished ground level. This includes the level above the founda-
tion wall or slab. There are other points of support, including structural
floors, shelf angles, and lintels where anchored veneers are designed in ac-
cordance with this section. 

VENEERS

Wood veneers that are found on exterior walls of buildings of Type I, II, III,
and IV construction cannot be less than 1 inch thick. Exterior hardboard
siding cannot be less than 0.438 inch and must conform the following:

CODE UPDATECODE UPDATE

Flashing and weep holes in anchored veneer shall be located in the
first course of masonry above finished ground level above the
foundation wall or slab, and other points of support.

178

CHAPTER 8

䡲 The veneer cannot be more than three stories in height, meas-
ured from the grade plane.
䡲 Where fire-retardant-treated wood is used, the height cannot
be more than four stories.
䡲 The veneer is attached to or furred from a noncombustible
backing that is fire-resistance rated as required by other provi-
sions of this code.
䡲 Where open or spaced wood veneers (without concealed
spaces) are used, they cannot project more than 24 inches from
the building wall.

When using anchored masonry veneer it is important to remember that not
only does it have to comply with this code, but also to ACI 530/ASCE 5 and
TMS 402. Anchored masonry veneers in accordance with this chapter are
not required to meet the tolerances in Article 3.3 G1 or ACI 530.1/ASCE
6/TMS 602, but slab-type veneer units no more than 2 inches in thickness
must be anchored directly to masonry, concrete, or stud construction. 

If veneer units are of marble, granite, or other stone units of slab and are
from ties of corrosion-resistant dowels in drilled holes, they must be lo-
cated in the middle third of the edge of the units. The spacing of these units
cannot be more than 24 inches maximum. Each unit cannot have less than
four ties per veneer unit and cannot be more than 20 square feet in area. 

If you choose to use veneer ties made of metal, make sure they are smaller
in area than 0.0336 by 1 inch or, if made of wire, not smaller in diameter
than 0.1483 inch wire. Some people prefer anchored terra cotta or ceramic
units to use on exterior walls of buildings. These too have to be installed ac-
cording to code restrictions. 

CODE UPDATE

Where the combustible exterior wall covering is furred from the
wall and forms a solid surface, the distance between the back of the
covering and the wall shall not exceed 1 5⁄8 inch.

EXTERIOR WALLS

179

CODE UPDATE

Wood veneer must not exceed 40 feet in height above grade.

Whether terra cotta is tied or not, the minimum thickness is 1.625 inches
and it must be directly anchored to masonry, concrete, or stud construc-
tion. Tied terra cotta or ceramic veneer units, along with the minimum
thickness of 1.625 inches, must also have projecting dovetail webs on the
back surface spaced approximately 8 inches. Veneer ties must have suffi-
cient strength to support the full weight of the veneer in tension. Adhered
masonry veneer must comply with the applicable requirements in Section
1405.9.1 and Sections 6.1 and 6.3 of ACI 530/ASCE 5/TMS 402. 

Metal supports for exterior metal veneer must be protected. You can paint,
galvanize, or use another coating or approved treatment. Wood studs, fur-
ring strips, or other wood supports for exterior metal veneer must be ap-
proved and pressure treated. Joints and edges that are exposed to the weather
must be caulked with a durable waterproofing material to prevent moisture
from seeping in. Grounding of metal veneers on buildings must comply with
the requirements of this code or the ICC Electrical Code. 

When using this next type of veneer—glass—there are a number of guide-
lines you must follow. The area of a single section of thin exterior structural
glass veneer cannot be more than 10 square feet in cases where it is not more
than 15 feet above the level of the sidewalk or grade level below, and cannot
be more than 6 square feet where it is more than 15 feet above that level.

Neither the length nor the height of the glass can be more than 48 inches,
nor can the glass be any thicker than 0.344 inch. Only apply the glass veneer
after making sure that the backing is thoroughly dry. You must apply an ap-
proved bond coat as well. Make sure this is applied uniformly over the en-
tire surface of the backing so as to effectively seal the surface. The glass can
then be set in place with mastic cement so that at least 50 percent of the area
of each glass unit is directly bonded to the backing by mastic not less than
0.25 inch thick and not more than 0.625 inch thick. The mastic cement
must be of an approved kind, and make note that the bond coat and mastic
must be evaluated for compatibility and must bond firmly together. 

180

CHAPTER 8

CODE UPDATE

Where open or spaced wood veneers that don’t have concealed
spaces are used they shall not project more than 2 feet from the
building wall.

In areas where glass extends to a sidewalk surface, each section must rest in
an approved metal molding and be set at least 0.25 inch above the highest
point of the sidewalk. The space between the molding and the sidewalk
must be thoroughly caulked and made water tight. If set above sidewalk
level and/or above 36 inches, the mastic cement binding must be supple-
mented with approved nonferrous metal shelf angles located in the hori-
zontal joints in every course. These shelf angles cannot be less than 0.0478-
inch thick and no less than 2 inches long and must be spaced at approved
intervals; with no less than two angles for each glass unit. 

Securing angles to the wall or backing should be done with expansion
bolts, toggle bolts, or by other approved methods. If you decide you want
to use glass veneers realize that there are specifications for the use of joints.
Unless otherwise specifically approved by the building official, abutting 
areas must be ground square and mitered joints cannot be used except
where specifically approved for wide angles. 

All glass veneers must be held in place by the use of fastenings at each ver-
tical or horizontal edge, or at the four corners of each glass unit, securing
the fastenings to the wall or backing with expansion bolts, toggle bolts, or
by other methods. The exposed edges of structural glass veneer must be

WINDOW SILLS

Where the opening of the sill portion of an operable window is located
more than 72 inches above the finished grade, the lowest part of the clear
opening of the window must be a minimum of 24 inches above the finished
floor surface of the room in which the window is located. This applies to
the following list of occupancies:

䡲 Groups R-2
䡲 Groups R-3
䡲 One family
䡲 Two family
䡲 Multiple family dwellings.

VINYL SIDING

Vinyl siding conforming to the requirements of this section and comply-
ing with ASTM D 3679 must be allowed to be installed on exterior walls of
buildings of Type V construction located in areas where the basic wind
speed does not exceed 100 miles per hour and the building height is less
than or equal to 40 feet in Exposure C. 

In areas where construction is located where the basic wind speed is more
than 100 miles per hour, or in building heights are over 40 feet, tests or cal-
culations in compliance with the code must be submitted. 

182

CHAPTER 8

Secure all vinyl siding to the building to protect exterior walls of the build-
ing from weather. Siding is to be applied over sheathing or other accept-
able materials, and applied to conform to water-resistive barrier require-
ments in this chapter. Even the nails that you use to apply the siding are
specified as to size. Unless otherwise specified in the manufacturer’s in-
struction, nails and accessories must have a minimum of 0.313-inch head
diameter and 0.125-inch shank diameter. 

All nails must be corrosion resistant and most importantly long enough to
penetrate the studs or nailing strip of at least 0.75 inches. If you have cho-
sen fiber cement siding for your building or structure, make sure the pan-
els are installed with the long dimension parallel to framing. Vertical joints
must occur over framing members and must be sealed with caulking or
covered with battens. Use Z-flashing and solid wood framing for horizon-
tal joints. Lap siding must be lapped a minimum of 1 ¼ inches and the ends
must be sealed with caulking covered with an H-section joint cover.

Roof Assemblies and 
Rooftop Structures

This section covers weather protection. Although short, the importance of
becoming familiar with the provisions of this section is not to be taken
lightly. I am going to review the provisions of weather protection regard-
ing roof decks first and all others will fall into place from there. I do want
to note that in some chapters of this book, I mentioned that some words
could be used interchangeably. This chapter, however, contains words and
phrases that cannot be used in this manner. For instance, there is a differ-
ence in definition between roof coverings, roof deck, and rooftop struc-
ture. I have added these as definition alerts for you.

Roof decks are required to be covered with an approved roof covering.
These must be secured to the building or structure in accordance with this
chapter. All roof coverings must be designed, installed, and maintained in
accordance to this code. They must also follow the manufacturer’s instruc-
tions in that the roof covering will protect the building or structure.

CHAPTER 9

! De f in i t iona le r t

Roof deck : The flat or sloped surface not including its supporting
members or vertical supports.

Flashing is an integral factor in a building’s ability to resist water intrusion
and must be installed in such a manner to prevent moisture from entering
the wall and roof through joints, materials, and at intersections or through
the roof plane. Attention to this important aspect of building performance
is necessary in both the design and installation of your building project.
Metal flashing must be corrosion resistant with a thickness of no less than
0.019 inch. Please see the following list regarding the locations in which
flashing must be installed:

䡲 Wall and roof intersections
䡲 Gutters
䡲 Changes in roof slope or directions
䡲 Around roof openings.

All parapet walls must be properly coped with noncombustible, weather-
proof materials. The width of the materials cannot be any less than the
thickness of the parapet wall. I’m sure you are aware that a new building or
structure will need a roof drainage system. If you didn’t know that, you do
now. Any design and installation of roof drainage systems must be done in
compliance with The International Plumbing Code. 

Gutters and leaders that are placed on the outside of buildings have to be
made of noncombustible material or a minimum of Schedule 40 plastic

installed according to manufacturer’s guidelines.

PERFORMANCE REQUIREMENTS

Wind resistance roof requirements are a serious matter. Just watching the
news and hearing about the tremendous damage caused by high winds,
heavy rains, and hurricanes is enough for anyone to realize how important
the provisions of this section are. 

Roof decks and roof coverings must be designed for heavy wind loads. This
section will focus more on the testing of roof elements and roof systems
and how they must conform to this code. 

Roof systems with built-up modified bitumen, either fully adhered or me-
chanically attached through fastened metal panel roof systems, and other
types of membrane roof coverings must be tested in accordance with FM
4450, FM 4470, UL 580, or UL 1897. If you have a metal panel roof system
through either fastened or standing seam, also must be tested with UL 580
or ASTM E 1592. An exception to this are metal roofs that are constructed
of cold-formed steel, where the roof deck acts as the roof covering and pro-
vides both weather protection and support for structural loads. These are
permitted to be designed and tested in accordance with the referenced
structural design standard of this code. For your information, I have listed
the acronyms used in the paragraph above:

! De f in i t iona le r t

Roof assembly: A system designed to provide weather protection
and resistance to design loads. The system consists of a roof
covering and roof deck or a single component serving as both the
roof covering and the roof deck. A roof assembly includes the roof
deck, vapor retardant, substrate or thermal barrier, insulation, vapor
retardant, and roof covering.

maximum allowance for roof height permitted for buildings with
gravel or stone on the roof in areas outside a hurricane-prone region
are addressed in the code.

䡲 ASTM: American Society for Testing and Materials.

With these acronyms handy, it will be easier for you to refer to these stan-
dards to be sure that your building’s components are correctly installed.

roofs must demonstrate physical integrity over the working life of the roof
based upon 2000 hours of exposure to accelerated weather testing that
must be conducted in accordance with ASTM G 152, 155, or 154. Roof
coverings that are subject to cyclical flexural response due to wind loads
cannot demonstrate any major loss of tensile strength. 

FIRE CLASSIFICATION

Roof assemblies are divided into classes of A, B, and C. The minimum roof
coverings installed on buildings must comply based on the type of con-
struction of the building. 

Class A roof assemblies are those that are most effective against severe fire
exposure. All Class A roof assemblies and coverings must be listed and
identified as such, by an approved testing agency. You may use this class for
all buildings or structures of all types of construction, except for Class A
roof assemblies with the following coverings:

䡲 Brick
䡲 Masonry
䡲 Slate

ROOF ASSEMBLIES AND ROOFTOP STRUCTURES

187

䡲 Clay
䡲 Concrete roof tile
䡲 Exposed concrete roof deck
䡲 Ferrous or copper shingles or sheets.

Class B roof assemblies are those that are effective against moderate fire-
test exposure and must be listed and identified as such by an approved test-
ing agency. An exception is Class B roof assemblies including those with
coverings of metal sheets and shingles. 

Class C roof assemblies are those that are effective against light fire-test ex-
posure. Class C assemblies must also be listed and identified by an ap-
proved listed agency. 

MATERIALS

There are applicable standards that materials must conform to, but if the
materials are of a questionable suitability, testing by an approved agency is
required by the building official to determine the quality or any limitations
of application of the materials. 

If you are receiving your roofing materials in bulk shipments there are a
couple of things to be aware of. First, all materials must have all informa-
tion issued in the form of a certificate or on a bill by the manufacturer. Sec-
ond, all materials must be in packages that have the manufacturer’s iden-
tifying marks and approved testing agency labels. This is a requirement of
this chapter.

REQUIREMENTS FOR ROOF COVERINGS

Provisions of requirements for roof coverings include the way in which
roof coverings are applied. This includes the manufacturer’s installation

instructions. For roofs located in areas where the basic wind speed is 110
mph or greater, asphalt shingles must be tested in accordance with ASTM
D 3161, Class F. 

Asphalt shingles must have self-seal strips or must be interlocking. All
packaging must have a label indicating compliance or a listing by an ap-
proved testing agency. Now don’t think that you can use any type of fas-
teners for this type of shingle. All fasteners for asphalt shingles must be gal-
vanized, stainless steel, aluminum, or copper roofing nails. These nails
must have a minimum 12 gage shank with a minimum diameter head of
0.375 inch. 

If roof sheathing is less than 0.75 inch, you must be sure that the nail will
penetrate. The code requires that there are a minimum number of fasten-
ers per shingle—no less than four fasteners per strip shingle or two fasten-
ers per individual shingle. There has been a change in the code regarding
the underlayment application for roof slopes. Distortions in the underlay-
ment must not interfere with the ability of the shingle to seal. 

Roof slopes of four units vertical in 12 units horizontal or greater, under-
layment must be one layer applied in the following manner. Underlayment
must be applied shingle fashion, parallel to and starting from the eave and
lapped 2 inches, fastened sufficiently to hold in place. 

As you are aware, various exterior building elements such as roofs, walls,
windows, and doors form a packet that protects the inside of the building
from elements; water being the biggest threat. Obviously a roof with ap-
propriate drainage minimizes this, but buildings need more than just a

Distortions in the underlayment must not interfere with the ability
of the shingles to seal. In areas of high winds (over 110 mph),
underlayment must be applied with corrosion-resistant fasteners,
and must be applied along the overlap at a maximum spacing of 36
inches on center, making sure to follow the manufacturer’s
instructions.

roof, which brings me to the installation of flashing and why it is so impor-
tant. Installed at intersecting roofs and parapets, this corrosion-resistant
metal overlaps to discourage water entrapment. 

Base flashing is the portion of the installation that is attached to the roof it-
self and cap flashing is attached to the projection or wall. Both must be
made of a corrosion-resistant metal. 

Valleys occur where the different roof slopes intersect and are considered
to be problem spots. Valley linings are to be installed in accordance with
the manufacturer’s instructions before applying shingles. For open valleys
lined with metal, the lining must be at least 16 inches wide. Lining of two
plies of mineral-surfaced roll roofing is permitted with the bottom layer
having a maximum of 18 inches and the top layer a minimum of 36 inches.

For closed valleys (valleys covered with shingles), lining of just one ply of
smooth roll roofing of at least 36 inches wide is permitted.

Be sure to provide a drip edge at eaves and gables of shingle roofs. Overlap
to a minimum of 2 inches and extend 0.25 inch below sheathing. Drip
edges must be mechanically fastened a maximum of 12 inches. 

CODE UPDATE

Roof decks are to be covered with an approved roof covering that is
secured to the building or structure it protects.

Fast Fact

Another type of roofing that is used is mineral-surfaced roll roofing
that cannot be applied on roof slopes below one unit vertical in 12
units horizontal. You must be careful of the underlayment of this
type of roofing.

When you have a tall projection or structure mounted on pitched roofs,
such as a chimney, you must use a saddle or cricket. A cricket is actually a
ridge that is installed between the roof slope and the structure. Cricket or
saddle coverings must be made of sheet metal or of the same material as the
roof covering. 

In areas where there has been a history of ice formation, an ice barrier that
consists of at least two layers of underlayment cemented together or of a
self-adhering polymer-modified bitumen sheet must be used instead of
normal underlayment and it must extend from the eave’s edge to a point at
least 24 inches inside the exterior wall line of the building. This does not in-
clude detached accessory structures that contain no conditioned floor area.
The last type of roof covering is wood shingles. 

ROOF INSULATION

The use of above-deck thermal insulation is permitted provided the insu-
lation is covered with an approved roof covering that passes the tests of FM
4450 or UL 1256. This does not include foam plastic roof insulation, which
must conform to the material and installation requirements found in the
code or where a concrete roof deck is used and the above-deck thermal in-

sulation is covered with an approved roof covering. If you are choosing to
install cellulosic fiberboard roof installation, you must be sure it conforms
to the material and installation requirements.

ROOFTOP STRUCTURES

A penthouse or other projection above the roof in structures of other than
Type I construction cannot be more than 28 feet above the roof where used
as an enclosure for tanks or for elevators that run to the roof and not more
than 18 feet for all other cases. A penthouse, bulkhead, or any other similar
projection above the roof cannot be used for any purposes other than hous-
ing for mechanical equipment or shelter of vertical shaft openings in the roof. 

If a penthouse or bulkhead is being used for purposes other than permitted
by this section, the use must conform to the requirements of this code. This
section does not prohibit the placing of wood flagpoles on the roof of any
building. The type of construction for penthouses must include walls, floors,
and roofs, required for that building. Exceptions to this include the following:

䡲 On buildings of Type I and II construction, the exterior walls
and roofs of penthouses with a fire separation distance of more
than 5 feet and less than 20 feet must be of at least one-hour
fire-resistance-rated noncombustible construction. 
䡲 Interior framing and walls must be made of noncombustible
construction.
䡲 On buildings of Type III, IV, and V construction, the exterior
walls of penthouses with a fire separation distance of more
than 5 feet and less than 20, must be at least one-hour fire-re-
sistance-rated construction.

equipment screens, fences, or similar enclosures are permitted
where located with a fire separation distance of at least 20 feet
from adjacent property lines and where not exceeding 4 feet in
height above the roof surface.
䡲 Dormers must be of the same type of construction as the roof on
which they are placed, or of the exterior walls of the building.

REROOFING

All materials that you use to reroof must be of the same quality as if you
were constructing new, except that reroofing does not have to meet the
minimum design slope requirements of one-quarter unit vertical in 12
units horizontal for roofs that provide positive roof drainage. Structural
roof components must be capable of supporting the roof-covering system
and the material and equipment loads of the system. There is a very impor-
tant provision to remember when reroofing. Never install a new roof with-
out first removing all existing layers of roof coverings where any of the fol-
lowing conditions occur:

䡲 Where the existing roof or roof covering is water soaked or has
deteriorated at the point that the existing roof or roof covering
is not adequate as a base for additional roofing

approved materials.

䡲 Where the existing roof covering is wood shake, slate, clay, ce-
ment, or asbestos-cement tile
䡲 Where the existing roof has two or more applications of any
type of roof coverings.

Exceptions to this are:

䡲 Complete and separate roofing systems, such as standing-seam
metal roof systems, that are designed to send the roof loads di-
rectly to the building’s structural system and that does not rely
on existing roofs and roof coverings for support, do not re-
quire the removal of existing roof coverings.
䡲 Metal panel, metal shingle, and concrete and clay tile roof cov-
erings are allowed over existing wood shake roofs when ap-
plied in accordance with this chapter.
䡲 The application of a new protective coating over an existing
spray polyurethane foam roofing system is permitted without
tear-off of existing roof coverings. 

There are some instances where you may reinstall materials. This applies
only to slate, clay, or cement tile that is not cracked, damaged, or broken.
You must reconstruct flashings in accordance with approved manufac-
turer’s installation instructions as well.

Structural Design

As you have seen with past chapters, I don’t normally begin with defini-
tions. However there have been changes with these definitions and I have
decided the easiest way to point these out is just by giving them their very
own section. So, here they are:

䡲 Diaphragm flexible: A diaphragm is flexible for the purpose of
distribution of story shear and torsional movement where so in-
dicated in Section 12.3.1 of ASCE 7, as modified in this chapter.
䡲 Fabric partitions: A partition consisting of a finished surface
made of fabric, without a continuous rigid backing, that is 
directly attached to a framing system in which the vertical
framing members are spaced greater than 4 feet on center.
䡲 Occupancy category: A category used to determine structural
requirements based on occupancy.
䡲 Vehicle barrier system: A system of building components near
open sides of a garage floor or ramp or building walls that act
as restraints for vehicles.

CHAPTER 10

All of these words have changes in definition, either in whole or part. In this
chapter you will notice letters and notations, for example “D + F” may be
one that you will see. These notations are also listed as definitions. Please see
the following list of notations that you will come across:

䡲 D = Dead load
䡲 E = Combined effect of horizontal and vertical earthquake in-
duced forces as defined in Section 12.4.3 of ASCE 7
䡲 Em = Maximum seismic load effect of horizontal and vertical
seismic forces as set forth in Section 12.4.3 of ASCE 7
䡲 F = Loads due to fluids with well-defined pressures and maxi-
mum heights
䡲 Fa = Flood load
䡲 H = Load due to lateral earth pressures, ground water pressure,
or pressure of bulk materials
䡲 L = Live load, except roof live load, including any permitted
live load reduction
䡲 Lr = Roof live load including any permitted live load reduction
䡲 R = Rain load
䡲 S = Snow load
䡲 T = Self-straining force arising from contraction or expansion
resulting from temperature change, shrinkage, moisture
change, creep in component materials, movement due to dif-
ferential settlement or combinations thereof
䡲 W = Load due to wind pressure.

CONSTRUCTION DOCUMENTS

Are you aware of what information needs to be included in construction
documents? There is some important information that cannot be left out
such as the size, section, and relative locations of structural members with
floor levels, column centers, and offsets dimensioned. The design loads
and other information pertinent to the structural design are described in
this section and must be indicated on the construction documents. Please
see the following exception: Construction documents for buildings con-

䡲 Floor and roof live loads
䡲 Ground snow lead
䡲 Basic wind speed (three-second gust), miles per hour, and
wind exposure
䡲 Seismic design category and site class
䡲 Flood design data, if located in flood hazard areas.

The floor live load that has been uniformly distributed and concentrated
and used in the design must be indicated for floor areas. If reduction is al-
lowed, that too, must be indicated. Construction documents must include
wind design data, regardless of whether wind loads govern the design of the
lateral-force-resisting system of the building. 

When wind enters a building, internal pressure and external suction create a
combined load on the construction causing the building or structure to re-
sult in a pile of sticks. The following list contains commonly used wind data:

䡲 Wind exposure, if more than one wind exposure it used, the

struction documents. If your building is located in whole or part of a flood
hazard area, the documentation pertaining to design, if required, must be
included and the following information, referenced to the datum on the
community’s Floor Insurance Rate Map or FIRM, is to be included, 
regardless of whether flood loads govern the design of the building: 

䡲 In flood hazard areas not subject to high-velocity wave action,
the elevation of the proposed lowest floor, including the base-
ment; the elevation to which any nonresidential building will
be dry flood-proofed
䡲 Elevations to which any nonresidential building will be dry
flood proofed
䡲 The proposed elevation of the bottom of the lowest horizontal
structural member of the lowest floor, including the basement.

GENERAL DESIGN REQUIREMENTS

Buildings and structures have to be designed and constructed in accor-
dance with the strength design, load and resistance design and allowable
stress design as permitted by the applicable material chapters in this book.
The structural components of any building or structure must be designed
and constructed to safely support the factored loads in load combinations
that have been designed in this code. You must be careful not to exceed the
appropriated strength limit stated for the materials of construction. You
must consult the building official for loads and forces for occupancies or
uses that are not covered in the chapter. All structural systems and mem-
bers must be designed to limit deflections and lateral drift. 

STRUCTURAL DESIGN

199

Account equilibrium, general stability, and geometric compatibility must
be taken into account to determine the load effects on structural members
and connections. Residual deformations that tend to accumulate on mem-
bers under repeated service loads must be included in the analysis in re-
gards to added eccentricities expected to occur during their service life.
Any system or method of construction to be used must be based on a ra-
tional analysis. This analysis must result in a system that provides a com-
plete load path capable of transferring loads from the origin point to the
load-resisting elements. 

Any rigid elements that are assumed not to be a part of the lateral-force-re-
sisting system are allowed to be incorporated into buildings provided their
effect on the action of the system is considered and provided for in the de-
sign. In instances where diaphragms are flexible, or are allowed to be ana-
lyzed as flexible, provisions will be made for the increased forces induced
on resisting elements of the structural system resulting from torsion due to
eccentricity between the center of application of the lateral forces and the
center of rigidity of the lateral-force-resisting system. 

Buildings and structures that have a relatively low hazard to people if there
is an emergency issue are categorized as occupancy I. The categories con-
tinue down to IV, with the nature of the occupancy in which these build-
ings or structures fit. As you can see this doesn’t give any information for
buildings that have two or more occupancies. In such cases, the structure
must be assigned to the classification of the highest nature. 

For example, if one part of the building is a storage facility and the other is
a jail or detention center, the building must be categorized as occupancy III
because there are people who occupy the jail. If the building or structure
has two separate portions with separate entrances, they must be catego-
rized separately. The building official is authorized to require an engineer-

ing analysis or a load test, or even both, of any building when there is a
question of safety regarding the construction of the occupancy in question. 

To resist the uplift and sliding forces that result from the use of prescribed
loads you must anchor the roof to walls and columns, and in turn, anchor
the walls and columns to foundations. If your building has concrete and
masonry walls, these must be anchored to floors, roofs, and other struc-
tural elements that are used to provide lateral support for the wall. Realize
that the required anchors that you use in masonry walls of hollow units or
cavity walls must be embedded in a reinforced grouted structural element
of the wall. 

Structural elements, components, and cladding must be designed to resist
forces from earthquakes and wind with consideration to overturning, slid-
ing, and uplift. As a contractor you must provide continuous load paths for
transmitting these forces to the foundation.

LOAD COMBINATIONS

In cases where allowable stress or working stress design is allowed, and
used by this code, structures and portions thereof must resist the most crit-
ical effects.

Please note these exceptions: 

䡲 Crane hook loads do not need to be combined with roof live
load or with more than three-fourths of the snow load or one-
half of the wind load; and flat roof loads of 30 psf or less do not
need to be combined with seismic loads, unless the flat roof
snow loads exceed 30 psf, 20 percent must be combined with
seismic loads. 

STRUCTURAL DESIGN

201

䡲 Keep in mind that increases in allowable stresses specified with
the referenced standards cannot be used with the load combi-
nation listed above, except that a duration of load increase is
permitted in accordance with code requirements.
䡲 There may be times when you will be allowed to use alternative
basic load combinations that include wind or seismic loads. In
these cases, allowable stresses can be increases or load combi-
nations reduced where permitted by the material chapter of
this book or the referenced standards. 
䡲 Be sure you are confident that you can make these changes and
understand the referenced standards carefully. 
䡲 Heliports and helistops landing areas are occupancies where
the load factors are of a serious nature. 

Landing areas must be designed in accordance to the following:

䡲 Dead load, D, plus the gross weight of the helicopter, Dh, plus
snow load, S
䡲 Dead load, D, plus two single concentrated impact load, L, ap-
proximately 8 feet apart applied anywhere on the landing area,
having a magnitude of 0.75 times the gross weight of the heli-
copter
䡲 Both loads acting together total one and one-half times the
gross weight of the helicopter
䡲 Dead load, D, plus a uniform live load, L, of 100 psf.

Please note that there is an exception to this, which is also a change in the
code, as follows: 

䡲 Landing areas designed for helicopters with gross weights not
exceeding 3000 pounds in accordance with bullets one and two
(above list) must be allowed to be designed using a 40 psf uni-
form live load in bullet three (above list), provided the landing
area is identified with a 3000 pound weight limitation. 
䡲 The 40 psf uniform live load cannot not be reduced and the land-
ing area weight limitation must be indicated by the numeral 3.

202

CHAPTER 10

! De f in i t iona le r t

Dead loads: The weight of materials of construction incorporated
into the building, including but not limited to walls, floors, roofs,
ceiling, stairways and other similarly incorporated architectural and
structural items, and the weight of fixed service equipment, such as
cranes, plumbing stacks and risers, electrical feeders, heating,
ventilating and air-conditioning systems. 

䡲 The appropriate location would be in the bottom right corner
of the landing area as viewed from the primary approach. 
䡲 The landing area weight limitation must be a minimum of 5
feet in height.

DEAD LOADS

Dead loads are the weights of various structural members and objects that
are permanently attached to the structure. There are two types of dead
loads—building dead loads and collateral dead loads. A building dead load
is the actual building system, such as a roof or floor and materials used for
covering such as decking, felt, and hinges. Collateral dead loads are the
weight of the permanent materials, such as drywall, sprinklers, and electri-
cal systems. Collateral dead loads do not include the weight of the actual
building system. In the absence of definite information, values will be sub-
ject to the approval of the building official. We call these dead loads be-
cause they are unable to be moved.

LIVE LOADS

One can’t have a dead load without a live load, so let’s explore this subject
a bit more. Live loads are not permanent and can change in magnitude.
Live loads include items that can be found inside of a building such as fur-
niture, safes, people, or stored materials. Environmental effects, such as
earthquakes, wind, and snow, that have the power to change and cause po-
tential damage or failure to a building, are also considered live loads. How-

STRUCTURAL DESIGN

203

ever, the live load will be determined in accordance with a method ap-
proved by the building official. 

Concentrate loads—force localized over a relatively small area such as
floors and similar surfaces—must be designed to support live loads that are
uniformly distributed. In office buildings and in other buildings where
partition locations are subject to change, requirements for partition weight
must be made. Whether these partitions are shown on the construction
documents or not, you must allow for them unless the specified live load is
more than 80 psf. In case you’re wondering, the partition load cannot be
less than a uniformly distributed live load of 15 psf. 

Truck and bus garages are among the many buildings which require a min-
imum live load. Both the uniform and concentration load must be uni-
formly distributed over a 10-foot width and placed within their individual
lanes. This will produce the maximum stress in each structural member,
but not on both at the same time. Keep in mind that all garages accommo-
dating trucks and buses must also be designed with an approved method
that contains provisions for traffic railings. 

Apartments, which include residential, have requirements for loads.
Handrail assemblies and guards must be able to resist 200 pounds in a sin-
gle concentrated load. This means in any direction at any point along the
top, and have attachment devices and supporting structures that can trans-
fer the loading.

With this said and with the exception of roof uniform, live loads and all other
minimum uniformly distributed live loads are allowed to be reduced in ac-
cordance with certain parts of this section. It is up to you to read and under-
stand these exceptions if they pertain to your building or structure. Note that
live loads over 100 psf cannot be reduced unless the following are true:

䡲 The live loads for members supporting two or more floors are
permitted to be reduced by a maximum of 20 percent, but the
live load cannot be less than the reduced design live load per
square foot.
䡲 For uses other than storage, where approved, additional live
load reductions are permitted where shown by the registered
design professional that a rational approach has been used and
that the reductions are necessary.

204

CHAPTER 10

As an alternative to the section above, floor live loads are permitted to be
reduced in accordance with the following provisions. These reductions ap-
ply to slab systems, beams, girders, columns, piers, walls, and foundations.

䡲 A reduction is not permitted in Group A occupancies.
䡲 A reduction is not permitted where the live load exceeds 100
psf except that the design live load for members supporting
two or more floors is permitted to be reduced by 20 percent.
䡲 A reduction will not be permitted in passenger parking garages
except that the live loads for members supporting two or more
floors may be reduced by a maximum of 20 percent.
䡲 For all live loads that are not more than 100 psf, the design live
load for any structural member supporting 150 square feet or
more is allowed to be reduced in accordance with the same
code exceptions.

Construction crews must consider not only how loading condition might
affect a structure, but also how loads are distributed. This affects both floor
and roof loads. Where the uniform floor live load is involved with the de-
sign of structural members the minimum applied loads must be the full
dead loads on all spans in combination with the floor live loads. This is to
create the greatest effect at each location under consideration. 

Where uniform roof loads are reduced to less than 20 psf and are involved
in the design of structural members, the minimum applied loads must also
be the full dead load on adjacent spans or on alternate spans, or whichever
produces the greatest effect. 

Minimum uniformly distributed roof live loads are allowed to be reduced,
but only to the following provision: ordinary flat, pitched, and curved
roofs are allowed to be designed for a reduced roof live load. However, you
must be careful with this because if your workers are using scaffolding for
a work surface for themselves and materials during maintenance and re-
pair jobs, a lower roof load than specified (in the equation below) cannot
be used unless approved by the building official. Human safety must al-
ways be at the top of your mind. 

There are times when cranes are used in construction. The crane live load
must always be the rated capacity of the crane. Design loads of moving

of the crane and the vertical impact, lateral, and longitudinal forces made
by the moving crane. The design load includes connections and support
brackets as well.

SNOW AND WIND LOADS

Other loads include elemental or weather related loads such as snow and
wind. Design snow loads are determined in accordance with ASCE 7. You
must use the extreme value statistical analysis to determine ground snow
loads that are found in the vicinity of the site using a value with a 2-percent
annual probability of being exceeded. The ASCE 7 is used to determine
wind loads on every building or structure. 

The type of opening protection, the basic wind speed, and the exposure
category for a site is determined in this chapter. Wind can be assumed to

206

CHAPTER 10

come from any horizontal direction and wind pressures can be assumed to
act normal to the surface that is being considered. 

There are several areas that are defined as hurricane-prone regions. These
regions include the U.S. Atlantic Ocean and Gulf of Mexico coasts where
the basic wind speed is greater than 90 mph, and Hawaii, Puerto Rico,
Guam, Virgin Islands, and American Samoa. Portions of these areas that
are within 1 mile of the coastal mean high water line where the basic wind
speed is 110 mph or greater; or portions of hurricane-prone regions where
the basic wind speed is 120 mph or greater; or Hawaii are also considered
wind-borne debris regions. 

For each wind direction considered, an exposure category that adequately
reflects The characteristics of ground surface irregularities must be deter-
mined for the site at which the building or structure is to be constructed.
You must take into account any variation in ground surface roughness that
arises from natural topography and vegetation as well as constructed fea-
tures. A ground surface roughness within each 45-degree sector is deter-
mined for a distance upwind of the site as defined from the categories pro-

eas, or other terrain with numerous closely spaced obstruc-
tions having the size of single-family dwellings or larger.
䡲 Surface Roughness C: Open terrain with scattered obstruc-
tions having heights generally less than 30 feet. This category
includes flat open country, grasslands, and all water surfaces in
hurricane-prone regions.

faces outside hurricane-prone regions. This category includes
smooth mud flats, salt flats, and unbroken ice.

Roof systems, such as roof decks, are affected by wind loads and must be
designed to withstand the wind pressures determined in accordance with
ASCE 7. If you are like most people, you’ve applied or intend to apply as-
phalt shingles to your roof deck for design. Make sure that any asphalt
shingles that you are using haVE been tested to determine the resistance of
the sealant to uplift forces using ASTM D 6381. You can find yourself in a

bit of a mess if you disregard this. All it takes is a heavy wind to come along
and blow those shingles off the roof of your building or structure. If you’ve
decided on using rigid tile for your roof covering make sure you note that
the code requirement is not the same.

Concrete and clay roof tiles complying with the following limitations must
be designed to withstand the aerodynamic uplift moment:

䡲 The roof tiles must be loose laid on battens, mechanically fas-
tened, or mortar/adhesive set.
䡲 The roof tiles must be installed on solid sheathing which has
been designed as components and cladding.
䡲 An underlayment must be installed in accordance with code
requirements.
䡲 The tile must be single lapped interlocking with a minimum
head lap of no less than 2 inches.
䡲 The length of the tile must be between 1.0 and 1.75 feet.
䡲 The maximum thickness of the tail of the tile cannot be more
than 1.3 inches.
䡲 Roof tiles using mortar set or adhesive set systems must have
at least two-thirds of the tile’s area free of mortar or adhesive
contact.

SOIL LATERAL LOADS

This section is short, but not necessarily unimportant and refers to base-
ments, foundations, and retaining walls that have to be designed to resist
lateral soil loads. Soil loads must be used as the minimum design lateral soil
loads unless specified otherwise in a soil investigation report. Make sure

CHAPTER 10

you get the investigation report approved by your building official. Base-
ment walls with restricted horizontal movement have to be designed for at-
rest pressure. Note that basement walls that do not extend more than 8 feet
below grade and supporting flexible floor systems will be allowed to be de-
signed for active pressure.

RAIN LOADS

When designing a building or structure, engineers and architects must
consider the loads, both external and internal, that a building must endure.
The building is then designed to resist these loads. A type of external load
is rain. When designing a building roof the goal is to have each portion of
the roof sustain the load of rainwater that will accumulate on it if the pri-
mary drainage system is not working properly. This is also true for uniform
load caused by water that has risen above the inlet of the secondary
drainage system. 

A change in the code has a provision for roofs equipped with a slope that
is less than ¼ inch per foot. The design calculations must include verifica-
tion of adequate stiffness to preclude progressive deflection in accordance
with Section 8.4 of ASCE 7. One drainage system is simply not enough. 

Roofs that are equipped with hardware to control the rate of drainage must
be equipped with a secondary drainage system. All secondary drainage sys-
tems must be at a higher elevation that limits any accumulation of water on
the roof above that elevation.

FLOOD LOADS

Flooding is when excess water overflows from bodies of water onto adja-
cent land. Flood areas are established by local government bodies with a
flood hazard map and other supporting data. This flood hazard map has to
include any areas of special flood hazards that have been identified by the
Federal Emergency Management Agency and presented as an engineering
report. This report has to be written in the following manner: The Flood
Insurance Agency for (NAME OF JURISDICTION), dated (INSERT
DATE OF ISSUANCE), as amended. Be sure to include the Flood Insur-
ance Rate Map (FIRM) and the Flood Boundary and Flooding Map
(FBFM) and any supporting data relating to the flood area.

Floods kill people and destroy homes in parts of the world every year. Ob-
viously, any structures or buildings built in floor-prone areas are perma-
nently at risk. Design and construction of buildings located in flood haz-
ard areas, including those areas that are at risk for high velocity wave
action, must be in accordance with ASCE 24. See the following list for doc-
umentation that must be prepared and sealed by a registered design pro-
fessional and submitted to the building official. The first list is for con-
struction in flood hazard areas not to subject high-velocity wave action:

䡲 The elevation of the lowest floor, including the basement, as
required by the lowest floor elevation inspection
䡲 For fully enclosed areas below the design flood elevation where
provisions to allow for the automatic entry and exit of flood-
waters do not meet the minimum requirements in Section
2.6.2.1 of ASCE 24, construction documents must include a
statement that the design will provide for equalization of hy-
drostatic flood forces in accordance with Section 2.6.2.2 of
ASCE 24.
䡲 For dry flood-proofed nonresidential buildings, construction
documents must include a statement that the dry flood-proof-
ing is designed in accordance with ASCE 24.

For construction in flood hazard areas subject to high-velocity wave action:

䡲 The elevation of the bottom of the lowest horizontal structural
member must be as required by the lowest floor elevation in-
spection.
䡲 Construction documents must include a statement that the
building is designed in accordance with ASCE 24, including

EARTHQUAKE LOADS

The 2009 International Building Code contains a provision that every
structure, and portion thereof, including non-structural components that
are permanently attached to structures and their supports and attach-
ments, must be designed and constructed to resist the effects of earthquake
motions in accordance with ASCE 7. This does not apply to Exterior Walls,
and Appendix 11A of the 2009 International Building Code book. You may
use this chapter or ASCE 7 to determine the seismic design category for
your structure. Please see the following list of exceptions:

䡲 Detached one- and two-family dwellings that are categorized
as A, B, or C of the Seismic Design Category.
䡲 The seismic-force-resisting system of the wood-frame building
that conforms to the provisions of the code is not required to
be analyzed as specified in this section.
䡲 Agricultural storage structures intended only for incidental
human occupancy
䡲 Structures that require special consideration of their response
characteristics and environment that are not addressed by this
code or ASCE 7 and for which other regulations provide seis-
mic criteria, such as vehicular bridges, electrical transmission
towers, hydraulic structures, buried utility lines and their ac-
cessories and nuclear reactors.

Any existing buildings that you plan on adding to, making alterations to,
or modifying must be done in accordance to Existing Structures. Please
note that this applies to any changes in occupancy as well.

Site class: A classification assigned to a site based on the types of
soils present and their engineering properties as defined in this
chapter.

Where required by Special Inspections specifies that seismic requirements
include the statement of special inspections and must identify the desig-
nated seismic systems and seismic-force-resisting systems and any addi-
tional special inspections and testing. This is to include the applicable stan-

Site class definitions are provided in the code. This is the classification as-
signed to a site based on the types of soils present and their engineering
properties. Based on site soil properties, the site is classified as Site Class A,
B, C, D, E, or F. But what if you’re not sure of the soil properties? If you are
unsure of the soil properties of your building or structure site and you do
not have sufficient detail to determine such information, use the classifica-
tion Site Class D until the building official or geotechnical data determines
which site class that the soil belongs in.

Soils and Foundations

This chapter contains provisions to building and foundation systems in ar-
eas that are not subject to scour or water pressure by the actions of wind or
wave action. 

In this chapter there are allowable bearing pressures, stresses, and design
formulas that are used with allowable stress design load combination spec-
ifications. When looking at the quality and design of materials used struc-
turally in excavations, footings, and foundations, one must also look at all
the requirements that the quality and design materials used for excava-
tions, footings, and foundations must conform to. Excavations and fills
must also comply with code requirements.

If the foundation is proportioned using the load combinations allowed,
and the computation of the seismic overturning moment is by the equiva-
lent lateral-force method, the proportioning must be in accordance with
Section 12.13.4 of ASCE 7.

CHAPTER 11

FOUNDATION AND SOILS INVESTIGATIONS

This section contains provisions for foundation and soil investigations. Clas-
sification and investigation of the soil must be made by a registered design
professional where required by the building official. If such investigation is re-
quired, it is the owner’s or applicant’s responsibility to submit the foundation
and soil investigation to the building official where required in this section. 

There are many reasons why a building official may require a foundation
and soil investigation. Any soils where the classification, strength, or com-
pressibility are in doubt or where a load-bearing value greater than that
specified in this code is claimed, the building official will require the nec-
essary investigation. 

There are four provisions that a soil must meet to be considered expansive.
Tests that show compliance with the first three bullets will not be required
if bullet 4 is conducted.

䡲 Plasticity index (PI) of 15 or greater, determined in accordance
with ASTM D 4318
䡲 More than 10 percent of the soil particles pass through a no. 2
sieve, determined in accordance with ASTM D 422
䡲 More than 10 percent of the soil particles are less than 5 microm-
eters in size, also determined in accordance with ASTM D 422
䡲 Expansion index greater than 20, determined in accordance
with ASTM D 4829. 

A subsurface soil investigation will be performed to find out if the ground-
water table is above or within 5 feet below the elevation of the lowest floor

Fast Fact

  Soils that swell when subjected to moisture are classified as
expansive soils and contain clay materials that attract and absorb
water. If the building official suspects that you may have this type
of soil, you can bet that a soil test will be required.

level where floors are located below the finished ground level adjacent to
the foundation. A subsurface soil investigation is not required where you
can provide waterproofing that is in accordance with this chapter. 

Another reason for foundation and soils investigations is for buildings and
structures with a Seismic Design Category C, D, E, or F. The investigation
for category C differs from D, E, and F and includes an evaluation of the
potential hazards that result from earthquake motions such as slope insta-
bility, liquefaction, and surface rupture due to faulting or lateral spreading.
Categories D, E, and F must meet the same investigation as Category C, in
addition to the following:

䡲 To determine the lateral pressures that are made by earthquake
motions and the affect they have on basement and retaining walls

䡲 An assessment of potential consequences of any liquefaction
and loss of soil strength, including estimation of differential
settlement, lateral movement, or reduction in foundation and
must address mitigation measures. You may use these meas-
ures for consideration in the design of the structure and can in-
clude ground stabilization and selection of appropriate foun-
dation types.

䡲 An evaluation for liquefaction and soil strength loss for site
peak ground acceleration must be done as well. An exception
to this is a site-specific study where peak ground acceleration
is determined in accordance with Section 21.2.1 of ASCE 7.

䡲 Foundation and soils investigations include soil classification
where soils are grouped according to their general behavior
under given physical conditions. It is important that you un-
derstand such classifications. 

Necessary tests of materials from borings, test pits, or other subsurface ex-
ploration and observation are used to determine soil classification. If re-
quired, additional studies must be made to evaluate the following:

䡲 Slope stability
䡲 Soil strength
䡲 Position and adequacy of load-bearing soils

216

CHAPTER 11

䡲 The effect of moisture variation
䡲 Compressibility
䡲 Liquefaction and expansiveness.

The soil classification and design load-bearing capacity must be put on the
construction document. The building official may request a written report
of the investigation and must be submitted. The following list contains in-
formation that is contained in the report. Take note that this list is not lim-
ited and there could be more specific information that the building official
is requesting.

䡲 A plot showing the location of test borings and/or excavations
䡲 A complete record of the soil samples
䡲 A record of the soil profile
䡲 Elevation of the water table, if encountered
䡲 Recommendations for foundation type and design criteria
䡲 Expected total and differential settlement
䡲 Pole and pier foundation information
䡲 Special design and construction provisions for footings or
foundations founded on expansive soils, as necessary
䡲 Compacted fill material properties and testing.

EXCAVATION, GRADING, AND FILL

Before digging any trenches, pits, tunnels, or other excavations, precau-
tions must be taken so that lateral support from any footing or foundation
is not disturbed or removed without unpinning or protecting the footing
or foundation against settlement or lateral translation. 

Backfill is the refilling of an excavated space with soil free of organic mate-
rial, construction debris, lumps that are larger than a pebble and boulders,
or with a controlled low-strength material (CLSM). Backfill must be com-
pacted in a manner that does not damage the foundation or the
water/dampproofing materials. 

In areas where footings will bear on compacted fill areas you must make
sure that the compacted fill complies with the provisions of an approved

report. Below is a list of the seven items that must be contained in such ap-
proved report:

䡲 Specifications for the preparation of the site prior to placement
of the compacted fill material
䡲 Specifications for material to be used as compacted fill
䡲 Test method to be used to determine the maximum dry den-
sity and optimum moisture content of the material to be used
as compacted fill
䡲 Maximum allowable thickness of each lift of compacted fill
material
䡲 Field test methods for determining the in-place dry density of
the compacted fill
䡲 Minimum acceptable in-place dry density expressed as a per-
centage of the maximum dry density determined in accor-
dance with bullet three of this list
䡲 Number or frequency of field tests required to determine com-
pliance with bullet six of this list

The provisions for controlled low-strength material (CLSM) on which foot-
ings will bear must follow similar rules. There is an approved report in
which specific provisions must be followed, including:

䡲 Specifications for the preparation of the site prior to placement
of CLSM
䡲 Specifications for the CLSM

Compacted fill material that is less than 12 inches in depth does not
need to comply with an approved report, provided it has been

controlled low-strength materials do not need to be compacted.

Immediately adjacent to the foundation is where site grading takes place.
The slope cannot be any less than one unit vertical for every 20 units hori-
zontal for a minimum distance of 10 feet measured perpendicular to the
face of the wall. You must provide a 5-percent slope for an approved alter-
native if physical obstructions or lot lines prohibit the original 10 feet re-
quirement. When using swales, they must be sloped for a minimum of 2
percent where located within 10 feet of the building foundation. 

Resistant surfaces that are within 10 feet of the building foundation must
be sloped for a minimum of 2 percent away from the building. One excep-
tion to this is for climatic or soil conditions. If such conditions exist, the
slope of the ground away from the building foundation is allowed to be re-
duced, but no less than one unit vertical in 48 units horizontal (2 percent
slope). The procedure that you use to establish the final ground level will
account for additional settlement of the backfill. Grading and fill for flood
hazard areas will not be approved unless the following is true:

䡲 Fill is placed, compacted, and sloped to minimum shifting,
slumping, and erosion during the rise and fall of flood water
and, if applicable, wave action
䡲 Demonstration through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses per-
formed by a registered design professional and done in accor-
dance with standard engineering practice that the proposed
grading or fill will not result in any increased flood levels
䡲 Fill is conducted and/or placed to avoid diversion of water and
waves toward any building or structure
䡲 Demonstration that the cumulative effect of the proposed
flood hazard area encroachment, when combined with all
other existing and anticipated flood hazard area encroach-
ment, will not increase the design flood elevation more than 1
foot at any point.

SOILS AND FOUNDATIONS

219

ALLOWABLE LOAD-BEARING VALUES OF SOILS

There are maximum allowances that you must adhere to for foundation
pressure, lateral pressure, or lateral sliding-resistance values. These must
not exceed the values allowed by code unless you have data to verify the use
of a higher value. Any higher values must be submitted and approved for
use.

Do not assume that mud, organic silt, organic clays, peat, or unprepared
fill have an acceptable load-bearing capacity unless you have the data to
back that up. I believe we all know what happens when we assume some-
thing to be true. And it would be a great deal of time, money, and energy
wasted if you assume that the use of a material is acceptable without the
data to back it up. That being said, there is however, an exception to this.
An acceptable load-bearing capacity is permitted to be used if the building
official considers the load-bearing capacity of mud, organic silt, or unpre-
pared fill to be adequate for the support of lightweight and temporary
structures.

To determine the resistance of structural walls to lateral sliding, calculate by
combining the values from the lateral bearing and sliding resistance. Re-
member you have to submit the reasons or data for this and obtain approval. 

In the case of clays, such as sandy, silty, or clayey silt, under no circumstance
can the lateral sliding resistance be more than one-half of the dead load. It is
possible for increases to be allowed for lateral sliding resistance. For each ad-
ditional foot of depth to a maximum of 15 times the tabular value.

FOOTINGS AND FOUNDATIONS

Footings and foundations are crucial to the success of a building. When
properly designed, footings and foundations withstand the forces of a
building. Footings and foundations are built directly on undisturbed soil,
compacted fill material, or CLSM, with a minimum depth of footings below
the undisturbed surface of 12 inches. While the top surface of footings has
to be level, the bottom surface is not. The bottom surface of footings is al-
lowed to have a slope not to exceed one unit vertical in 10 units horizontal. 

There are times when it is necessary to change the elevation of the top sur-
face; this is when footings must be stepped. Another important element re-

220

CHAPTER 11

garding footings and foundations is frost protection. Foundation walls,
piers, and other permanent supports of buildings and structures must be
protected, by either extending below the frost line, erecting on solid rock, or
constructing in accordance with ASCE 32. If your building is free-standing
and all of the following conditions are met, frost protection is not required.

Buildings classified in Occupancy Category I include areas of 600 feet or
less for light-frame construction or 400 square feet or less for other than
light-frame construction with an eave height of 10 feet or less.

Footings that are on granular soils (soils consisting mainly of sands and
gravels), must be located so that the line drawn between the lower edge of
adjoining footings will not have a steeper slope more than 30 degrees with
the horizontal, unless the material supporting the higher footing is braced
or retained or otherwise laterally supported in an approved manner. For the
most part, buildings that are below slopes are set apart from the slope at an
acceptable distance from the slope for protection from slope drainage. 

In cases where the existing slope is steeper than one unit vertical in one unit
horizontal, the toe of the slope is to be assumed to be at the foundation.

Most wet basements are caused by surface water which is not adequately
drained from the foundation wall. On graded sites, the top of the exterior
foundation is to extend above the elevation of the street gutter from an 
approved drainage device. Alternate elevations are allowed with permission
of the building official if you can demonstrate that required drainage to the
point of discharge and away from the structure is provided at all locations. 

An alternate setback and clearance are also allowed, but, once again, with
the building official’s permission. The official has the authority to request
an investigation and recommendation of a registered design professional
to demonstrate that the intent has been satisfied. Any investigation of this 
request includes the consideration of material, height of the slope and
slope gradient, load intensity, and erosion characteristics of any materials
used for the slope.

Footings are to have a minimum width of 12 inches. Structural Design,
contains provisions for unfavorable effects due to the combinations of load
and footings. The dead load is permitted to include the weight of founda-
tions, footings, and overlying fill. Reduced live loads are allowed to be used
in the design of footings. 

SOILS AND FOUNDATIONS

221

When machinery operations or other vibrations are sent through the foun-
dation, you must give consideration in the footing design to prevent detri-
mental disturbances of the soil. There is much to learn and understand
about vibratory loads to concrete footings. Design, materials, and construc-
tion of concrete footings not only have to comply with this chapter, but to
concrete requirements as well. Please be aware though, that in instances
where a specific design is not provided, concrete footings that support walls
that are made of light-frame construction can be designed in accordance
with the code, and all concrete in footings must have a specified compres-
sive strength of no less than 2500 pounds per square inch at 28 days.

It is important that you do not place concrete footings through water. You
may seek permission from the building official if you are using a funnel or
some other method. The key is to get the building official to give you 
approval to use a funnel to place concrete. You must be sure to protect
concrete from freezing during the time that you are placing it and for a to-
tal of no less than five days thereafter. Under no circumstance is water al-
lowed to flow through concrete that has been laid in the ground. Next we
will examine foundation walls. 

When you have a difference in height between the exterior finish ground
level and the lower of the top of the concrete footing that supports the
foundation you end up with an unbalanced backfill height. There are in-
stances when an unbalanced backfill height is permitted, such as where an
interior concrete slab on grade is provided and is in contact with the inte-
rior surface of the foundation wall. And foundation walls of rough or ran-
dom rubble stone cannot be less than 16 inches thick and rubble stone can-

extend beyond the thickness of the footing on either side.

not be used for foundations for structures in Seismic Design Category C,
D, E, or F. 

Foundation wall materials such as concrete must be constructed in accor-
dance with the code and with the following list:

䡲 The size and spacing of vertical reinforcement is based on the
use of reinforcement with minimum yield strength of 60,000
psi, or vertical reinforcement with minimum yield strength of
40,000 psi. 50,000 psi is permitted, provided the same size bar
is used and the spacing shown in the table is reduced by mul-
tiplying the spacing by 0.67 or 0.83.

䡲 Vertical reinforcement, when required, must be placed nearest
the inside face of the wall a distance from the outside face of the
wall. The distance is equal to the wall thickness, minus 1.25
inches plus one-half the bar diameter. The reinforcement must
be placed within a tolerance of 3/8 inch where the distance is less
than or equal to 8 inches.

䡲 Instead of the support shown in some parts of the code, smaller
reinforcing bar sizes with closer spaces can be used if this pro-
vides an equal amount of reinforcement.

䡲 Any concrete covering used for reinforcement that is meas-
ured from the inside face of the wall cannot be less than ½ inch.
If measured from the inside face of the wall, the measurement
cannot be less than 1.5 inches for no. 5 bars; 2 inches for
smaller bars.

䡲 Concrete must have a specified compressive strength of not
less than 2500 psi at 28 days.

Just like concrete foundation walls, masonry foundation walls must comply
with similar standards:

䡲 The minimum vertical reinforcement for masonry founda-
tions will have a strength of 60,000 psi.
䡲 The specified location of the reinforcement has to be equal or
greater to the depth distance as stated in the code.
䡲 Masonry units must be installed with Type M or S mortar.

SOILS AND FOUNDATIONS

223

PIER AND PILE FOUNDATIONS

This section starts with some definitions that pertain to the code require-
ments of the International Building Code book. You will see these words
used frequently in this section so it’s good that you have the definitions to
refer to when needed.

䡲 Flexural length is the length of the pile from the first point of
zero lateral deflection to the underside of the pile cap or grade
beam.
䡲 Micropiles are 12-inch-diameter or less bored, grouted-in-
place piles incorporating steel pipe (casing) and/or steel rein-
forcement.
䡲 Pier foundations consist of isolated masonry or cast-in-place
concrete structural elements extending into firm materials. 
䡲 Piers are relatively short in comparison to their width, with
lengths less than or equal to 12 times the least horizontal di-
mension of the pier. Piers derive their load-carrying capacity
through skin friction, end bearing, or a combination of both.
䡲 Pile foundations consist of concrete, wood, or steel structural
elements either driven into the ground or cast in place. 
䡲 Piles are relatively slender in comparison to their length, with
lengths exceeding 12 times the least horizontal dimension. 
䡲 Piles derive their load-carrying capacity through skin friction,
end bearing or a combination of both.

The general requirements for piers and piles must follow the provisions of
this section where Group R-3 and U occupancies do not exceed two stories
of light-frame construction or where the surrounding foundation materi-
als furnish adequate lateral support for the pile. These are subject to the ap-
proval of the building official. You must design and install your pier and
pile foundations on the basis of a foundation investigation (this was de-
fined earlier in the chapter), unless you have sufficient data on which to
base your design and installation. An investigation and report is expanded
for pier and pile foundations to include the following list (keep in mind
though that this list is not limited and the building official may require ad-
ditional information):

224

CHAPTER 11

䡲 Recommended pier or pile types and installed capacities
䡲 Recommended center-to-center spacing of piers or piles
䡲 Driving criteria 
䡲 Installation procedures
䡲 Field inspection and reporting procedures (to include procedures
for verification of the installed bearing capacity where required)
䡲 Pier or pile load test requirements
䡲 Durability of pier or pile materials
䡲 Designation of bearing stratum or strata
䡲 Reductions for group action, where necessary.

There are special types of piles that are not specifically mentioned in this
code that can be used. However, you must submit acceptable test data, cal-
culations, and other information that relates to the structural properties
and load capacity of such piles. It is only after the building official reviews
and approves such information that you will be allowed to use the special
pile. In any case, the allowable stresses cannot exceed the limitations that
have been set. 

You must brace all piers and piles to provide lateral stability in all directions.
To be considered braced, three or more piles must be connected by a rigid
cap, provided that the piles are located in radial directions from the center of
mass of the group not less than 60 degrees apart. A two-pile group in a rigid
cap is also considered to be braced along the axis connecting the two piles.
Any methods that are used to brace piers or piles must be subject to the ap-
proval of the building official. Be careful when installing piers and piles. 

Any disturbance in the required sequence of the required installation can
cause distortion and damage and can adversely affect the structural in-
tegrity of piles that you are currently installing or ones that are already in
place. The International Building Code will allow you to reuse existing
piers or piles under certain circumstances and only with the approval of the
building official. You will have to submit evidence that the piers or piles are
sound and meet all requirements of this code. 

All exiting piers and piles have to be load tested or redriven to verify their
capabilities as well. The design load applied to such piers or piles must be

SOILS AND FOUNDATIONS

225

the lowest allowable load as determined by such tests. There is an approved
formula along with load tests or methods of analysis to determine the al-
lowable axial and lateral loads on piers or piles. The allowable compressive
load on any pile where determined by the application of an approved driv-
ing formula can not be more than 40 tons. You must use the wave equa-
tion method of analysis for allowable loads over 40 tons to estimate pile
drivability of both driving stresses and net displacement per blow at the ul-
timate load. To use a follower you must obtain permission from the build-
ing official and you cannot use a fresh hammer cushion or pile cushion
material just prior to final penetration. 

When there is any doubt regarding design load for any pier or pile founda-
tion, testing must be done in accordance with ASTM D 1143 or ASTM D
4945. The following are allowable methods of load test evaluations that are

䡲 Other methods approved by the building official.

Piers, individual piles, and group of piles must develop ultimate load ca-
pacities of at least twice the design working loads in the designated load-
bearing layers. And load-bearing capacities of piers or piles that are discov-
ered to have a sharp or sweeping bend will be determined by an approved
method of analysis or by load testing a representative pier or pile. The max-
imum compressive load on any pier or pile due to mislocation cannot be
more than 110 percent of the allowable design load. All piers and piles need
proper lateral support to prevent buckling and to allow the design of the
pier or pile. This support must be in accordance with accepted engineering
practice and provisions of this code. 

In addition to learning about allowable pier and pile loads one must be
aware of the requirements for seismic design of piers and piles. In the first
part of this section you will learn about Seismic Design Category C. (Cate-
gories D, E, and F will follow shortly thereafter). Individual pile caps, piers,
or piles must be interconnected by ties. These ties must be capable of carry-
ing a force equal to the product of the larger pile cap or column load times

the seismic coefficient divided by 10. This can be disregarded only if you can
demonstrate that equal restraint is provided with reinforced concrete
beams within slabs on grade, reinforced concrete slabs on grade, or very
dense granular soils. The code provides an exception to this that states,
“Piers supporting foundation walls, isolated interior post detailed so the
pier is not subject to lateral loads, lightly loaded exterior decks and patios of
Group R-3 and U occupancies not exceeding two stories of light-frame con-
struction, are not subject to interconnection if it can be shown the soils are
of adequate stiffness, subject to the approval of the building official.” 

Seismic category structures must connect concrete piles and concrete-
filled steel pipe piles to the pile cap by embedding the pile reinforcement
or field-placed dowels anchored in the concrete pile. This must be embed-
ded for a distance that is equal to the development length. For deformed
bars this means the development length is the full development length for
a compression or tension. You must be sure that the ends of hoops, spirals,
and ties are terminated with seismic hooks. 

The American Concrete Institute (ACI) 318, Building Code Requirements
for Structural Concrete, Section 21.1 defines this with more clarity and I
recommend that you refer to this when terminating these ends. Please note
that anchorage of concrete-steel pipe piles is allowed to be done using de-
formed bars developed into the concrete portion of the pile. Structures that
are assigned to Seismic Design Category C must follow design details. 

Pier or pile moments, shears, and lateral deflections used for design have to
be established considering the nonlinear interaction of the shaft and soil, as
recommended by a registered design professional. A pile may be

Fast Fact

Unbraced piles in air, water, or in fluid soils have to be designed as
columns in accordance with the provisions of this code. Piles that
are driven into firm ground are considered to be fixed and laterally
supported at 5 feet below the ground surface; in soft material at 10
feet. The building official does have the authority to make any
alterations to this after a foundation investigation by an approved
agency.

SOILS AND FOUNDATIONS

assumed to be rigid if the ratio of the depth of embedment of the pile-to-
pile diameter or width is less than or equal to six. You must always include
pile group effects from soil on lateral pile nominal strengths where pile cen-
ter-to-center spacing in the direction of lateral force is less than eight pile
diameters. The same is true for vertical pile strength where center-to-center
spacing is less than three pile diameters. 

The second part of seismic design of piers of piles is for those structures
that have be assigned to Seismic Design Category D, E, or F. In addition to
this section, Seismic Design Categories D, E, or F must adhere to the re-
quirements for Seismic Design Category C too. Provisions of The Ameri-
can Concrete Institute (ACI) 318, Building Code Requirements for Struc-
tural Concrete, Section 21.10.4 must apply when not in conflict with this
chapter. Concrete for category D, E, or F must have a specified compres-
sive strength of not less than 3000 psi at 28 days. Please see the following
list for exceptions to the above:

䡲 Group R or U occupancies of light-frame construction and two
stories or less in height are allowed to use concrete with a speci-
fied compressive strength of not less than 2500 psi at 28 days.
䡲 Detached one- and two-family dwellings of light-frame con-
struction and two stories or less in height are not required to
comply with the provisions of ACI 318, Section 21.10.4.
䡲 Section 21.10.4 of ACI 318 does not apply to concrete piles.

The design details of piers, piles, and grade beams have to be designed and
constructed to withstand maximum imposed curvatures from earthquake
and ground motions and structure response. Curvatures must include free-
field soil strains that have been modified from soil-pile-structure interaction.
Site Class E or F sites have to be designed and detailed in accordance with
ACI 318, Sections 21.4.4.1, 21.4.4.2 and 21.4.4.3 within seven pile diameters
of the pile cap and the interfaces of soft to prestressed concrete piles. ACI 318
dictates many provisions regarding seismic design, including grade beams.
However, grade beams that have the capacity to resist the forces from load
combinations do not need to conform to ACI 318.

For piles that are required to resist uplift forces or provide rotational re-
straint, design of anchorage of piles into the pile cap has to be provided

228

CHAPTER 11

considering the combined effect of axial forces. The minimum of 25 per-
cent of the strength of the pile in tension must include anchorage. Anchor-
age into the pile cap must be capable of developing the following:

䡲 In the case of uplift, the lesser of the nominal tensile strength
of the longitudinal reinforcement in a concrete pile, or the
nominal tensile strength of a steel pile, or the pile uplift soil
nominal strength factored by 1.3, or the axial tension force re-
sulting from the load combinations
䡲 In the case of rotational restraint, the lesser of the axial and
shear forces and moments resulting from the load combina-
tions or development of full axial and shear nominal strength
of the pile.

If the vertical lateral-force-resisting elements are columns, the grade beam
or pile cap flexural strengths must exceed the column flexural strength.
The connections between batter piles and grade beams or pile caps must be
designed to resist the nominal strength of the pile acting as a short column.
Batter piles and connections must be capable of resisting forces and mo-
ments from the load combinations. 

DRIVEN PILE FOUNDATIONS

Timber is strong, light in weight, and capable of adequate support. Timber
piles are round, tapered timbers with the small end embedded into the soil.
Timber piles used to support permanent structures are to be treated in ac-
cordance with this section and must be designed in accordance with AFPA
NDS (American Forest and Paper Association). Round timber piles must
conform to ASTM D 25 while sawn timber piles must conform to DOC 
PS-20 (Department of Congress). Timber piles that are used for support in
permanent structures must comply with this section. If it is established that
you will be using the tops of the untreated timber piles below the lowest
ground-water level assumed to exist during the life of the lowest structure,
only then do timber piles not have to comply with this section. 

The AWPA U1 (Commodity Specifications E, Use Category 4C) contains
very important information to refer to for driven pile foundations. When
working with timber piles and suddenly noticing an increase in rate of pene-

SOILS AND FOUNDATIONS

229

tration you must conduct an investigation for possible damage. If the sudden
increase in rate of penetration is not related to soil strata, you must remove
the pile for inspection, or if non-viable the timber pile must be rejected.

The second type of driven pile foundations that we will review is precast con-
crete piles. Precast concrete piles have to comply with design and manufac-
ture, must be of a minimum dimension, and must comply with reinforce-
ment and installation requirements.

To resist all stresses brought on by handling, driving, and service loads;
piles must be designed and manufactured in accordance with accepted en-
gineering practices. Concrete piles must have a minimum lateral dimen-
sion of 8 inches and corners of square piles must be chamfered, which
means to have a bevel or groove and the longitudinal reinforcement must
be at least 0.8 percent of the concrete section and consist of at least four
bars. You must never drive a precast concrete pile before the concrete has
attained a compressive strength of at least 75 percent of the 28-day speci-
fied compressive strength, but no less than the strength sufficient enough
to withstand handling and driving force.

MICROPILES

Micropiles are 12-inch-diameter or less bored, grouted-in-place piles in-
corporating steel pipe (casing) and/or steel reinforcement. There has been
a change in the code regarding micropiles and in this section I have cov-
ered all of these changes. Keep your eyes open for any details that pertain
to your construction or building needs and as always ask your local build-
ing official to clarify any questions that you may have regarding this code.

Micropiles must have a grouted section reinforced with steel pipe or steel
reinforcing. Micropiles develop their load-carrying capacity through soil,
bedrock, or a combination of soil and bedrock. The full length of the mi-
cropile must contain either a steel pipe or steel reinforcement. One of the
materials used with micropiles is grout. 

Grout must have a 28-day specified compressive strength no less than
4,000 psi. As with all piles, micropiles too must be reinforced. For piles or
portions of piles grouted inside a temporary or permanent casing or inside
a hole drilled into bedrock, the steel pipe or reinforcement must be de-
signed to carry at least 40 percent of the design compression load. 

230

CHAPTER 11

You can use rotary or percussive drilling as a method, with or without cas-
ing, to form a hole for the pile. The pile must be grouted using a fluid ce-
ment grout and pumped through a tremie pipe that extends to the bottom
of the pile until the grout comes back up to the top. There are eight require-
ments of this code that must be applied to specific installation methods:

䡲 For piles grouted inside a temporary casing, the reinforcing
steel must be inserted prior to withdrawal of the casing. 
䡲 The casing must be withdrawn in a controlled manner with the
grout level maintained at the top of the pile to ensure that the
grout completely fills the drill hole. 
䡲 Make sure you monitor the grout level inside the casing when
you are withdrawing the casing so you can see that there is
nothing obstructing the flow of the grout.
䡲 You must verify the design diameter of the drill hole for a pile
that is grouted in an open drill hole in soil without temporary
casing.
䡲 By using a suitable means for piles designed for end bearing
you will be verifying that the bearing surface is properly
cleaned prior to grouting.
䡲 Subsequent piles cannot be drilled near piles that have been
grouted until the grout has had enough time to harden.
䡲 You must grout piles as soon as possible after you have com-
pleted drilling.
䡲 For piles designed with casing full length, the casing must be
pulled back to the top of the bond zone and reinserted to ver-
ify grout coverage outside the casing.

PIER FOUNDATIONS

Isolated piers used as foundation must comply with minimum dimensions
of 2 feet with the height not exceeding 12 times the least horizontal dimen-
sion. Reinforcements where required must be assembled and tied together
and must be placed in the pier hole as a unit before the reinforced portion
of the pier is filled with concrete. This does not apply to steel dowels that
have been embedded 5 feet or less in the pier. Please note this exception:
Reinforcement is permitted to be wet set and the 2 ½ -inch concrete cover

Fast Fact

Where a steel pipe is used for reinforcement, the portion of the
cement grout enclosed within the pipe is permitted to be included at
the allowable stress of the grout. The provisions for seismic
reinforcement differ from above. Any building or structure that is
deemed to be of Seismic Design Category C must have a permanent
steel casing from the top of the pile down 120 percent times the
flexural length. If a building or structure is of Seismic Design Category
D, E, or F, this pile will be considered as an alternative system.

requirements can be reduced to 2 inches for Group R-3 and U occupancies
that are not more than two stories of light-frame construction, provided
that the construction method can be demonstrated to the satisfaction of
the building official.

When placing concrete you have to do so in such a way that any foreign
matter is taken out and to secure a full-sized shaft. You may not place con-
crete through water unless a tremie or other method has been approved. Do
not just chute the concrete directly into the pier. Concrete must be poured
in a rapid and continuous operation through a funnel hopper that you have
placed in the center at the top of the pier. If you find that the pier founda-
tion has belled at the bottom, you must check to see that the edge thickness
of the bell is not less than what is required for the edge of footings.

This chapter taught us many things about soils and foundations and the
do’s and don’t of piers and pile foundations. It has referred you to other
publications which go into greater detail regarding concrete and the provi-
sions that you must follow while building your foundations.

Wood

This chapter contains provisions for materials, design and construction,
and the quality of wood and wood fasteners. 

There has been a change in the code regarding the general design require-
ments of structural elements or systems constructed in part or in whole
of wood or wood-based products. These must be in accordance with the
following:

䡲 Sections 2304, 2305, and 2306 contain the requirements for 
allowable stress design.
䡲 Sections 2304, 2305, and 2307 contain the requirements for
load and resistance factor design.
䡲 Sections 2304 and 2308 contain the requirements for conven-
tional light-frame construction.
䡲 Note this exception: Buildings that have been designed in 
accordance with the provisions of the AF&PA WFCM are con-
sidered to have met the requirements of Section 2308.

CHAPTER 12

Dimensions of lumber are reasoned to be nominal dimensions unless 
selected as actual dimensions for the purpose of this chapter.

MINIMUM STANDARDS AND QUALITY

This section contains the minimum standards and quality for the different
types of wood and other materials used in construction and include, but
are not limited to: preservative-treated wood; structural log members; pre-
fabricated wood I-joists; staples; and nails.

Sawn lumber used for load-supporting purposes must be identified by the
grade mark of a lumber grading agency. You can use an inspection agency
too, but keep in mind that the agency you use must be approved by an ac-
creditation body that complies with DOC PS 20 or equal. All grading prac-
tices and identification has to comply with the procedures of DOC PS 20,
as well. A certificate of inspection may be accepted instead of the grade
mark, but only if all provisions have been met. You are also permitted to
use approved end-jointed lumber instead of solid-sawn members as long
as they are of the same species and grade. 

There are many items in this chapter that also must follow the guidelines as
set forth in other referenced standards. These include the following:

䡲 Prefabricated wood I-joists—ASTM D 5055
䡲 Structural glued-laminated timber—AITC A 190.1 and ASTM
D 3737
䡲 Wood structural panels—DOC PS 1 or PS 2
䡲 Hardboard—AHA A 135.6
䡲 Pre-finished hardboard—AHA A 135.5
䡲 Particleboard—ANSI A208.1
䡲 Preservative-treated wood—AWPA U1 and M4.

CODE UPDATE

Conventional light-frame construction is a type of construction
where the primary structural elements are formed by a system of
repetitive wood-framing members.

Fast Fact

When applied to the outside of foundation walls, fiberboard wall
insulation must be protected below the ground level with a
bituminous coating.

Fiberboard

Fiberboard and its various uses must conform to ASTM C 208, as well as
fiberboard sheathing. Edges must be tight-fitting with square or U-shaped
joints. When fiberboard is used as insulation, regardless of construction,
you must ensure its protection with an approved roof covering. 

Fiberboards are allowed as wall insulation in all types of construction as
long as they are installed and fireblocked. If used in fire walls and barriers,
but not treated to comply with Section 803.1 for Class A materials, you
must be sure to cement the boards directly to the concrete or other non-
combustible base. They must be protected with an approved noncom-
bustible veneer anchored to the base without intervening airspaces. 

Trusses

Wood used as trusses must be preservative treated and marked with a qual-
ity mark of an inspection agency that upholds continuing supervision, test-
ing, and inspection over the quality of the preservative-treated wood. All
inspection agencies for such wood must be listed by the accreditation body
that complies with the requirements of the American Lumber Standards
Treated Wood Program. The label that is affixed on the wood must con-
tain the following:

䡲 Identification of the manufacturer that treated the wood
䡲 Type of preservative used
䡲 Minimum preservative retention
䡲 End use for which the product is treated
䡲 AWPA standard to which the product was treated
䡲 Identification of the inspection agency.

CHAPTER 12

Trade Tip

Did You Know?

Fast Fact

Preservative-treated wood that is used in enclosed locations
without a reasonable means of drying must have a moisture
content of 19 percent or less before it can be covered with materials
such as insulation, interior wall finish, or other materials.

Fire-Retardant-Treated Lumber

All fire-retardant treated lumber and wood structural panels also must be
labeled with the following:

䡲 An I.D. mark from an approved agency
䡲 Identification of the treating manufacturer
䡲 Name of the treatment
䡲 Species of wood
䡲 Flame spread and smoke index
䡲 Method of drying that was used
䡲 Conformance with appropriate standards
䡲 For wood exposed to weather, include these words: “No in-
crease in the listed classification when subjected to the Stan-
dard Rain Test” (ASTM D 2898).

Wherever fire-retardant treated wood is exposed to damp or wet locations,
it must be identified as exterior. This indicates that there is no increase in
the listed flame spread index. For interior uses, fire-retardant treated wood
cannot have a moisture content over 28 percent when tested in accordance
with ASTM D 3201. This type of wood has to be dried so that the moisture
content is 19 percent or lower for lumber and 15 percent or lower for wood
structural panels. 

GENERAL CONSTRUCTION REQUIREMENTS

When working with general construction requirements, you will be working
with lay-up patterns. The five standard patterns that can be used are as follows:

WOOD

237

䡲 Simple span pattern: All pieces are supported by two supports
䡲 Two-span continuous pattern: All pieces are supported by
three supports with all end joints occurring in line on every
other support.
䡲 Combination simple and two-span continuous pattern: End
spans alternate with simple and two-span continuously. Stag-
ger end joints in adjacent courses only over supports.
䡲 Cantilevered pieces intermixed pattern: For this pattern, the
decking covers a minimum of three spans. Pieces in the starter
course and every third course must be simple span. Cantilever
the pieces in the other course over the supports with end joints
alternating.
䡲 Controlled random pattern: This decking covers a minimum
of three spans with end joints within 6 inches of being in line
in either direction. There are no end joints in this pattern.

Be aware of changes for mechanically laminated decking if that is what you
choose. This decking consists of square-edged dimension lumber lamina-
tions that are set on edge and nailed to the adjacent piece and to the sup-
port. Also, you cannot use nails that are less than 2.5 times the net thick-
ness of each lamination either.

When using sheathing nails, make sure that the head or crown is just flush
with the surface of the sheathing and not into the sheathing. The code does
allow use of clips, glues, or any other methods as long as they are approved.
When using fasteners in preservative-treated wood, you must use hot
dipped zinc-coated galvanized steel. You can also use stainless steel or cop-
per, but the coating weights must be in accordance with ASTM A 153. 

CODE UPDATE

The following types of wood are considered termite resistant:
redwood, Alaska yellow-cedar, eastern red cedar, and both
heartwood and all sapwood of western red cedar.

238

CHAPTER 12

The exception to this allows fasteners other than nails, timber rivets, or wood
screws which are mechanically deposited zinc coated steel, but these must
have a coating weight in accordance with ASTM B 695, Class 55 minimum.

As a reminder, fastenings for wood foundations must meet the require-
ments of AF&PA Technical Report No. 7.

Decay and Termites

Termite resistant wood must be used for wood floor framing, especially in
areas heavily populated with termites. Water-borne preservatives, in ac-
cordance with AWPA U1, are used to preserve such wood for use above the
ground. There are many woods used above the ground, such as wood
joists, sleepers and sills, wood siding, and girder ends, which are connected
in one way or another to the foundation. 

GENERAL DESIGN REQUIREMENTS

All buildings and structures need to have lateral-force-resisting systems to
resist seismic or wind loads. Then again, compliance with the AF&PA is 
allowed subject to the limitations of this code. To calculate shear resistance
of diaphragms and shear walls, you can use principles of mechanics by 
using the values of fastener strength and sheathing shear resistance. You
must have positive connections and anchorages between the shear panel
and the attached components that are capable of resisting the design forces.
The capacity of toenail connections cannot be used in Seismic Design Cat-
egory D, E, or F when calculating lateral load resistance to transfer lateral
earthquake forces in excess of 150 pounds per feet. 

For structures of Seismic Design Category F, you must follow certain re-
quirements. Wood structural panel sheathing that is used for diaphragms
and shear walls that are part of the seismic-force-resisting systems must be

applied directly to the framing members, except for wood structural panel
sheathing in a diaphragm which is allowed to be fastened over solid lumber
planking only if the panel joints and lumber planking joints do not coincide.

When designing structures with rigid diaphragms, refer to the require-
ments of Section 12.3.2 of ASCE 7 and the horizontal shear distribution 
requirements of Section 12.8.4 of ASCE 7, as rigid diaphragms must com-
ply with these sections. Refer to your local code book to find the diaphragm
length and width for plan view of open-front buildings. 

ALLOWABLE STRESS DESIGN

The following list of applicable standards contains the provisions in which
the allowable stress design of wood elements must comply.

䡲 American Forest & Paper Association
䡲 American Institute of Timber Construction
䡲 American Society of Agricultural Engineers
䡲 APA—The Engineered Wood Association
䡲 Truss Plate Institute, Inc.

There has been a change in the code for some parts of this section, such as
wood diaphragms. Wood structural panel diaphragms are allowed to resist
horizontal forces by using the allowable shear capacities. The allowable ca-
pacities that are found in the code must be increased by 40 percent for wind
design, and sheathed lumber (diagonally) diaphragms must be nailed in
accordance with nailing requirements.

This brings us to the application of gypsum board, or lath, and plaster to
wood framing. There are several steps to take to ensure proper adherence.
When joint staggering, make sure the end joints of adjacent courses of gyp-

240

CHAPTER 12

sum board do not occur over the same studs. You must be familiar with
the maximum allowable shear values for blocking, fasteners, gypsum lath,
and sheathing for gypsum boards. 

CONVENTIONAL LIGHT-FRAME CONSTRUCTION

As the title suggests, this section is intended for conventional light-frame
construction. Other methods are allowed, but only if you submit a satisfac-
tory design that is in compliance in every way necessary with this code.
One- and two-family homes and multiple single-family buildings, such as
townhomes, no more than three stories above grade plane with separate
means of exit, must comply with the International Residential Code. 

Floor Joists

The spans for floor joists must comply with tables found in your local code
book.

For other spans and species that you cannot locate in the building code,
please refer to AF&PA Span Tables for Joists and Rafters. The ends of each
joist, other than where supported on a 1 inch by 4 inch ribbon strip and
nailed, cannot have less than 1½ inches of bearing on wood or metal or less
than 3 inches. Make sure that all joists are supported laterally at the ends
and at each support by solid blocking, except where the ends of the joists
are nailed to the header. 

The ends of header joints that are longer than 6 feet must be supported by
framing anchors or joist hangers unless the header joints are bearing on a
beam or wall.

A braced wall line is a series of braced wall panels in a single story. All
braced wall lines must meet all the requirements of this code. Such require-
ments include location, type and amount of bracing.

Trade Tip

Did You Know?

Fast Fact

When joist framing is on opposite sides of a beam or girder, make
sure it is lapped at least 3 inches. If not lapped, then tie the opposite
ends together in the manner which has been approved. A joist must
be cut away to give way for floor openings. Specifications usually
require that headers be double and framed between the full-length
joists, also known as trimmers, on either side of the floor opening.

Braced Wall Panels

There are several methods to construct braced wall panels. Use one of the
following:

䡲 Wood boards of 5/8-inch minimum thickness applied diago-
nally on studs with spacing of no more than 24 inches
䡲 Fiberboard sheathing panels of no less than ½-inch thickness
applied vertically or horizontally on studs with spacing of no
more than 16 inches
䡲 Portland cement plaster on studs spaced 16 inches

Remember that ceiling joists must have a minimum allowable span.

Purlins

Purlins that are installed for roof load support can be used to reduce the
span of rafters within the allowable limits. These must be supported by
struts to bearing walls and under no circumstance can a purlin be smaller
than the rafter that it is supporting. This horizontal structural member
must adhere to the allowable limits. For example, a purlin that is 2 inches
by 4 inches, has a maximum length of 4 feet, and if the purlin is 2 inches by
6 inches, the maximum length is 6 feet.

Engineered Wood Products

As mentioned several times previously, there are many changes to the Inter-
national Building Code. One of these changes states that engineered wood
products, which can be composite lumber, prefabricated I-Joists, and struc-

tural glue-laminated timber, cannot be notched or drilled unless the man-
ufacturer has given permission to do so or unless the effects of doing so are
specifically stated in the design by a registered design professional.

I make it a point to mention that there are additional requirements for
conventional construction in Seismic Design Category B or C. In Seismic
Design Category C, structures of conventional light-frame construction
cannot be more than two stories in height, and concrete or masonry walls
cannot extend above the basement. Be aware of the following exceptions:

䡲 You may use masonry veneer in the first two stories above
grade plane or in the first three stories where the lowest story
has concrete or masonry for Category B, only if panel wall
bracing is used and is 1½ times the required length. 
䡲 You may use masonry veneer in the first story above grade
plane or the first two stories above grade plane where the low-
est story has concrete or masonry walls in Category B or C.
䡲 You may use masonry veneer in the first two stories above grade
plane in Category B or C if the type of brace used in Section
2308.9.3 is Method 3 and the bracing of the top story is located
at each end and at least every 25 feet. You must also provide
hold-down connectors at the ends of braced walls for the second
floor to the first floor assembly with a design of 2000 pounds.

䡲 You may not use cripple walls.

In the remainder of this chapter I will cover irregular structures. You may
not use conventional light-frame construction in irregular parts of struc-
tures in Seismic Design Category D or E. 

There are six conditions in which a portion of a building or structure will
be deemed irregular. If your building or structure contains one or more of
these conditions you have an irregular structure. Such conditions are as
follows:

䡲 Exterior braced wall panels are required to be in one plane ver-
tically from the foundation to the uppermost story. If this is
not true of your structure, it will be considered to be irregular.
As with many sections of this book, this too has exceptions.
Floors with cantilevers that are not more than four times the
depth of the floor joists are permitted provided that the follow-
ing is true:
– Floor joists are 2 inches by 10 inches or larger.
– The back span to the cantilever has a ratio of 2:1.
– Floor joists at the ends of the braced walls are doubled.
– A continuous rim joint is connected to the ends of 
cantilevered joists.
䡲 The ends of cantilevered joists cannot carry gravity loads from
more than a single story.
䡲 Any section of a floor or roof that is not laterally supported by
braced wall lines on all edges will be considered irregular; how-
ever, portions of roofs or floors that do not support braced
wall panels are allowed to extend up to 6 feet. 

CODE UPDATE

Wood products that are impregnated with chemicals by a pressure
process shall be processed in a closed vessel under pressure not less

CODE UPDATE

The design for the transfer of loads and anchorage of each truss to
the supporting structure is the responsibility of the registered
design professional.

䡲 If the end of a required braced wall panel is more than 1 foot
over an opening in the wall below, your structure is irregular.
Braced wall panels are allowed to extend more than 8 feet in
width if the header is 4 inches by 12 inches or larger. 
䡲 If portions of a floor level are vertically offset so the framing
members on either side cannot be lapped or tied, you will qual-
ify for an irregular structure. Framing supported directly by
foundations do not need to be lapped or tied. 
䡲 If braced wall lines are not perpendicular to each other, you
have an irregular structure.
䡲 Openings in floor and roof diaphragms that have a maximum
dimension more than 50 percent of the distance between lines
of bracing will put your structure in the irregular structure
category.

CODE UPDATE

Where wood joists or the bottom of a wood structural floor without
joist are closer than 18 inches, or wood girder are closer than 12 inches
to the exposed ground in crawl spaces or unexcavated areas located
within the perimeter of the building foundation, the floor construction
shall be of naturally durable or preservative-treated wood.

Plastic

It seems that we use more and more plastic components as time moves forward.
They are a part of construction that is not likely to go away anytime soon.

The types of plastics included in this section are as follows:

䡲 Foam plastic
䡲 Foam plastic insulation
䡲 Plastic veneer
䡲 Interior plastic finish and trim
䡲 Light-transmitting plastics.

FOAM PLASTIC INSULATION

When your package of foam plastic insulation arrives at the job site, see
that the label of an approved agency is attached to the package or the con-
tainer and shows the manufacturer’s name, the product listing, the prod-
uct identification and any information that will be used to identify the end

CODE UPDATE

A polymeric composite material consisting of reinforcement fibers,
impregnated with a fiber-binding polymer which is then molded
and hardened is a fiber reinforced polymer.

use with the code requirements. Both foam plastic insulation and foam
plastic cores of manufactured assemblies will have a flame spread index of
not more than 75. A smoke-developed index of not more than 450 must
also be a characteristic of the foam insulation, and both must be in accor-
dance with ASTM E 84. All loose fill-type foam plastic must be tested as
board stock for the flame spread index and smoke-developed index. A list
of exceptions is as follows:

䡲 Section 2604.2 contains the smoke-developed index for inte-
rior trim.
䡲 In buildings that are used as cold storage, like ice plants, food
plants, or food processing rooms, where insulation is tested in
a thickness of 4 inches, insulation will be allowed in a thickness
up to 10 inches if the building is equipped throughout with an
automatic fire sprinkler.
䡲 Roof-covering assemblies such as Class A, B, or C that contain
foam plastic insulation provided that the insulation passes FM
4450 or UL 1256
䡲 Foam plastic insulation that is greater than 4 inches in thick-
ness must have a maximum flame index of 450 when tested at
a minimum thickness of 4 inches.
䡲 Flame spread and smoke-developed indexes for foam-devel-
oped plastic interior signs in covered mall buildings provided
the signs comply with Section 402.15.

With the exceptions of masonry and concrete construction, and cooler and
freezer walls, foam plastic must be separated from the inside of the build-
ing by a thermal barrier of 1/2-inch gypsum wallboard. This is to limit the

PLASTIC

247

average temperature rise of the unexposed surface to no more than 250°F
after 15 minutes of fire exposure, complying with the standard time-tem-
perature curve of ASTM E 119. As stated previously, no thermal barrier is
needed in masonry or concrete construction. This is true if the concrete
wall, floor, or roof system is covered on each face by a minimum of 1-inch
thickness of masonry or concrete. Nor is a thermal barrier required for
cooler and freezer walls that are installed with foam plastic with a thickness
of 10 inches. Cooler and freezer walls must:

䡲 Have a flame spread index of 25 or less with a smoke-devel-
oped index of no more than 450
䡲 Have flash ignition and self-ignition temperatures of no less
than 600°F to 800°F
䡲 Have a covering of no less than 0.032-inch corrosion-resistant steel
with a base metal thickness no less than 0.0160 inch at any point
䡲 Be protected by an automatic sprinkler system 
䡲 A cooler or freezer within a building must also be part of the
building protected by sprinklers.

In one-story buildings that have a foam plastic with a flame spread index of
less than 25, cooler and freezer walls are not required to have a thermal bar-
rier in or on outside walls in a thickness no more than 4 inches thick. This is
only true where the foam is covered by a no less than 0.032-inch-thick alu-
minum steel with a base thickness of 0.0160 inch. The building must be fully
equipped throughout with an automatic sprinkler system. Foam plastic insu-
lation mounted in accordance with both the code and the manufacturer’s in-
structions must be separated from the inside of the building with a wood
panel sheathing no less than 0.47 inch thick and bonded with exterior glue.

The following list contains the provisions for doors that are not required to
have a fire protection rating:

䡲 Pivoted or side-hinged doors having a flame spread index of 75
or less are allowed as a core material.
䡲 For exterior doors in buildings of Group R-2 or R-3, foam-
filled entrance doors must be faced with wood or another ap-
proved material.

248

CHAPTER 13

! De f in i t iona le r t

Foam plastic insulation: A plastic that expands with the use of a
foaming agent producing a reduced-density plastic with voids of
open or closed cells distributed throughout the plastic for thermal
insulating purposes. Foam plastic insulation has a density less than
20 pounds pcf.

䡲 Garage doors with foam plastic used as core materials must
have a door facing of metal with a thickness of 0.032 inch. 

There is an exception for garage doors using foam plastic insulation and
the compliance with Section 2603.3 in regards to detached and attached
garages of one- and two-family dwellings that exempt them from the ther-
mal barrier requirement. Anytime that foam plastic is used as interior trim,
and compliance with Section 2604 is met, a thermal barrier is not needed.
This also is true for interior signs that comply with Section 402.15. How-
ever, be aware that foam plastic signs that are not attached to the interior
of a building must comply with the International Fire Code.

Foam plastic insulation, exterior coatings and facings all must be tested
separately for the thickness intended for use, flame index spreads, and
smoke-developed index. ASTM E 84 has determined that the flame index
spread for all three cannot be more than 25 with a smoke-developed index
of less than 450. However, prefabricated or factory-manufactured panels

Trade Tip

Did You Know?

Fast Fact

When you apply foam plastic spray to a sill plate and header of Type
V construction there are three requirements that must be met.
Plastic foam spray must have a maximum thickness of 3¼ inches,
foam plastic must have a density range of 1.5 to 2.0 pcf, a flame
spread index of 25 or less, and a smoke-developed index of 450 or
less when tested with ASTM E 84.

PLASTIC

249

can be tested as an assembly as long as the foam plastic core is not exposed
during construction and only if panels have a minimum thickness of
0.020-inch aluminum facing and a total thickness of 0.25 inch or less.

There has been a change in this code regarding the use of foam plastics and
the protection against termites. 

It is now known that termites have a huge tendency to burrow through ex-
panded polystyrene and other foam plastics to get to wood. Therefore, you
cannot install exterior foam plastics below grade. There are a few excep-
tions as follows:

䡲 In buildings where walls, floors, and ceilings are made of wood
treated with a preservative or noncombustible materials
䡲 When there has been an approved method used to protect
foam plastic and structures from termite damage
䡲 On the inside of basement walls.

Foam plastics are not required to comply with Sections 2603.4 through
2603.7 if approval has been met through testing. This testing is not limited
to NFPA 286, FM 4880, UL 140, or 1715, and any testing must be in rela-
tion to the use of the foam plastic. When allowed for use as an interior 
finish—and only on the basis of special testing will this be allowed. Testing
will include seams, joints, and other details typically used for this type of
installation. Testing must also include the manner intended for use.

INTERIOR FINISH AND TRIM

Plastic materials must comply with this section when installed as interior
finish and trim. Also refer to the last sentence of the above paragraph as a
reminder of special approval. When and if you receive special approval to
use plastic materials for trim you must also comply with the following:

䡲 Interior trim must have a minimum density of 20 pcf.
䡲 Interior trim must have a maximum thickness of 1/2 inch with
a maximum width of 8 inches.
䡲 There will be an area limitation of no more than 10 percent of
the aggregate wall and ceiling area of any room or space.

250

CHAPTER 13

䡲 When tested in accordance with ASTM E 84, the flame spread
index will not be more than 75. 
䡲 No limitation is made on the smoke-developed index.

PLASTIC VENEER

Plastic veneer used inside of a building must be in compliance with inte-
rior finish and trim. You are allowed to install exterior plastic veneer on the
exterior walls of buildings and are not restricted to the type of construc-
tion; however, there are guidelines that must be met. See the following list
for these guidelines:

䡲 Plastic veneer must comply with Section 2606.4.
䡲 Do not attach plastic veneer to any outside wall with a height
of more than 50 feet above grade.
䡲 There is a 300 square foot minimum for sections of plastic 
veneer with a separation minimum of 4 feet.
䡲 Note that the area and separation requirements and the
smoke-density limitation do not apply to Type VB construc-
tion, provided that there is not a fire-resistance rating require-
ment for walls.

LIGHT-TRANSMITTING PLASTICS

Before any light-transmitting materials are used, you must first submit, for
approval, sufficient data to demonstrate the use of such materials. It is up
to the building official to allow the use of light-transmitting materials in
your building or structure. Light-transmitting plastics include thermoplas-
tic, thermosetting, or reinforced thermosetting plastic materials, and all of
these must have a self-ignition temperature of 650°F or higher when tested
in accordance with ASTM D 1929.

CODE UPDATE

Foam plastics installed as trim must not constitute more than 10
percent of the specific wall or ceiling areas to which it is attached.

PLASTIC

251

The smoke-developed index cannot be greater than 450 when tested in 
accordance with ASTM E 84, or greater than 75 when tested in accordance
with ASTM D 2843. All light-transmitting materials must conform to ei-
ther Class CC1, in which plastic materials have a 1 inch or less burning ex-
tent when tested at a thickness of 0.060 inch, or Class CC2, in which plas-
tic materials have a burning rate of 2 1/2 inches per minute when tested at a
thickness of 0.060 inch. Both classes must be tested in accordance with
ASTM D 635. 

Light-transmitting plastic materials must comply with provisions regarding
the durability of strength and loads. The building official will use any data
that establishes stresses, maximum weight spans, and other important in-
formation in making decisions regarding the use of light-transmitting plas-
tics. Submission of this information and data is mandatory on your part;
without doing so, you will not have approval from the building official.

There are certain occupancies and locations in which a light-diffusing sys-
tem cannot be installed without an automatic sprinkler system. These oc-
cupancies and locations are as follows:

䡲 Group A occupancies with an occupant load of 1000 or more
䡲 Theaters with a stage and proscenium opening and an occu-
pant load of more than 700
䡲 Group I-2 and I-3 occupancies
䡲 Stairways and passageways intended for exits.

Hangers of at least No. 12 steel must be used as support for light-transmit-
ting diffusers. These must be hung directly or indirectly from ceilings or
roof construction and the hangers must be made of a noncombustible ma-
terial. Be sure that you are in compliance with the code, unless the plastic
diffusers have the ability to fall from their mountings before ignition takes
place at a temperature of 200°F; this temperature is below the ignition tem-
perature of panels. Please note that panels cannot be more than 10 feet in
length or 30 square feet in length.

You are allowed, by this code, to install light-transmitting plastics as glaz-
ing in shower stalls, doors, and bathtub enclosures as long as you are in
compliance with Glass and Glazing.

252

CHAPTER 13

LIGHT-TRANSMITTING PLASTIC WALL PANELS

You cannot use light-transmitting plastic as wall panels in exterior walls in
occupancies of the following groups.

䡲 A-1

䡲 A-2

䡲 H

䡲 I-2

䡲 I-3.

This is allowed in other groups, but only if the walls are not required to
have a fire-resistance rating, and installation conforms to this section. For
instance, exterior wall panels cannot alter the type of construction. 

Lastly, the combining of light-transmitting plastic glazing and light-trans-
mitting plastic wall panels is subject to height, area, and percentage limita-
tions along with any separation requirements. 

LIGHT-TRANSMITTING PLASTIC GLAZING

Be reminded that there are provisions regarding the protection for open-
ings in exterior walls of Type VB construction. However, areas that are not
required to comply are permitted to have light-transmitting plastic as long
as it in compliance with its proper section of this chapter and also in accor-
dance with the following.

䡲 The total area of the plastic glazing cannot be more than 25
percent of any area of any wall face of the story in which it is
installed, except for those areas that have an automatic sprin-
kler system; only then can the total area be increased to a max-
imum of 50 percent.

䡲 Installation of an approved flame barrier between glazed units
in adjacent stories is allowed and it must extend 30 inches 
beyond the outside wall or a vertical panel no less than 4 feet.
An exception to this is a building equipped throughout with an
automatic sprinkler system.

PLASTIC

253

䡲 Do not install light-transmitting plastics more than 75 feet
above grade plane. Again, an exception to this is a building
equipped throughout with an automatic sprinkler system.

LIGHT-TRANSMITTING PLASTIC ROOF PANELS

Such panels cannot be installed in Groups H, I-2, and I-3. You may install
them in other groups as long as they comply with any one of the following
conditions.

䡲 The building has an automatic sprinkler system throughout.
䡲 The roof is not required to comply with the fire-resistance rating
䡲 Roof panels meet the requirements for roof coverings.

Roof panels are required to be limited in area, and the total area of panels
is limited by a percentage of the floor area. The following  list of exceptions
address this provision.

䡲 Area limitations are increased by 100 percent if the building
has an automatic sprinkler system.
䡲 Low-hazard occupancy buildings are exempt from limitations
provided that the buildings are no larger than 5000 square feet
with a minimum fire separation distance of 10 feet.
䡲 Greenhouses without public access are exempt from area lim-
itations, but only if they have a minimum fire separation dis-
tance of 4 feet.

CODE UPDATE

Light-transmitting plastic covers on solar collectors having
noncombustible sides and bottoms shall be permitted on buildings
not over three stories above grade plane of 9000 square feet in total
floor area, provided the light-transmitting plastic cover does not
exceed one third of the roof area for CC1 materials or 25 percent of
the roof area for CC2 materials.

254

CHAPTER 13

䡲 Roof coverings of terraces and patios in Group R-3 occupan-
cies are permitted to have light-transmitting plastics.

LIGHT-TRANSMITTING PLASTIC SKYLIGHT GLAZING

This section provides the provisions for skylight assemblies with light-
transmitting plastics. If installing unit skylights glazed with light-transmit-
ting plastic, refer to the code book for compliance requirements. This pro-
vision does not include skylights that contain light-transmitting plastics
that already conform to code. It is ruled that light-transmitting plastics be
set upon curbs that have been constructed above the plane of the roof by at
least 4 inches. Make sure that all edges are protected by metal or another
material that has been approved for protective use. 

Any material you use must be ignition resistant to exposure of flames.
Curbs are not required for skylights that are used on roofs with a minimum
slope of three units vertical in 12 units horizontal. This pertains to occu-
pancies in Group R-3 and for buildings that have a noncombustible roof
covering. Also, metal or noncombustible edge materials are not required
where non-classified roof coverings are allowed. 

There is a maximum of 100 square feet within the curb area that skylights
must have; however, this area limitation does not apply to buildings
equipped with an automatic sprinkler system. Make sure that you have
placed all your skylights with a distance of no less than 4 feet measured in
a horizontal plane. 

Buildings with automatic sprinkler systems and Group R-3 occupancies
with more than one skylight that do not exceed the area limitations in this
section are not included in the separation provisions.

LIGHT-TRANSMITTING PLASTIC INTERIOR SIGNS

Light-transmitting plastic interior signs must follow the provisions of the
code and cannot have an area more than 20 percent of the wall area with a
maximum area of 24 square feet. The edges and backs of all plastic interior
signs must be fully encased in metal.

Encroachments 
Into the Public Right-of-Way

Due to the lack of pertinent information, this book does not include com-
mentary regarding encroachments into the public right-of-way. However,
this is an important area of reference in the 2009 International Building
Code.
