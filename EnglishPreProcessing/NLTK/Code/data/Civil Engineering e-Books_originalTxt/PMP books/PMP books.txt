Uh-oh – the PMP® exam spec isn’t out yet!

This edition of Head First PMP went to press in June 2009 in order to coincide with 
the new version of the PMP® Exam released in July 2009. As of this time, the most 
recent version of the PMP® Examination Specification was published in 2005, and 
this exam conforms to that specification. That’s why so many people who have 
passed the PMP exam using Head First PMP have told us that the real exam is very similar to 
this one. As soon an updated spec is published, we will release an updated version of this exam. 
You’ll always be able to get the most up-to-date version of this exam as a free PDF download

PMI doesn’t keep it a secret!

They publish a specification for the exam. It’s 
called the Project Management Professional 
(PMP®) Examination Specification, and you 
can buy it from the “Bookstore” section of the 
PMI website. It’s got a lot more details than what 
we put on this page—this is just the broad strokes. 
But we were careful to stick closely to the spec 
when we created this final exam.

Promote Interaction Among 
Stakeholders 

PMI places a lot of value on personal 
integrity. Before you can become a PMP-
demonstrate that you know the right 
certified project manager, you need to 
thing to do in a lot of tricky situations.

more unlikely that your project will lose a significant amount of material if a theft does occur. 
You decide to monitor the risk from time to time to be sure that it continues to have a low 
probability and impact. Where do you record the risk so that you don’t lose track of it?

Before you find out how you did on the exam, here are a few 
ideas to help make the material stick to your brain. Remember, 
once you look through the answers, you can use these tips to 
help you review anything you missed.

1

 Don’t get caught up in the question.

If you find yourself a little confsued about a question, the first thing you 
should do is try to figure out exactly what it is the question is asking. It’s 
easy to get bogged down in the details, especially if the question is really 
wordy.  Sometimes you need to read a question more than once. The 
first time you read it, ask yourself, “What’s this question really about?”

Try this stuff out on your job.

Everything you’re learning about for the PMP exam is really practical. 
If you’re actively working on projects, then there’s a really good chance 
that some of the ideas you’re learning about can be applied to your job. 
Take a few minutes and think about how you’d use these things to make 
your projects go more smootly.

3

When you write your own question, you 
do a few things: 
•	
You reinforce the idea and make 
it stick to your brain. 
•	
You think about how questions are 
structured. 
•	
By thinking of a real-world 
scenario where the concept is used, you 
put the idea in context and learn how 
to apply it.
 And all that helps you recall it better.!

 Write your own questions.

Is there a concept that you’re just not getting? One of the best ways that 
you can make it stick to your brain is to write your own question about 
it! We included “Question Clinic” exercises in Head First PMP to help 
you learn how to write questions like the ones you’ll find on the exam. 
And if you visit http://www.headfirstlabs.com/PMP, you’ll find 
a fill-in form to help you construct your own questions—and you can 
see questions that other people have written. And that’s all going to help 
you understand the material better.

Exam Que s t ion s

1. Answer: C
It’s not enough that the Project Manager approves of the Project Management Plan; it needs 
to be approved by all of the stakeholders in the project.  Everyone on the team should feel 
comfortable with the processes that are going to be used to do the work. 

2. Answer: B
Joe is doing root-cause analysis on process problems: that’s Perform Quality Assurance.  
Remember, Perform Quality Control is when you are trying to find problems in your work 
products through inspection. Perform Quality Assurance is when you are looking at the way your 
process affects the quality of the work you are doing. 

3. Answer: C
The RACI matrix shows roles and responsibilities on your project. RACI stands for Responsible, 
Accountable, Consulted, Informed. Some people on your project will be responsible for activities, 
others might be accountable for them. The RACI matrix is a table that shows people and how 
they relate to the work that is being done. 

4. Answer: A
When a change has been approved you always need to update the baseline and then 
implement the change.  That way, you will be sure to track your performance versus new scope 
and schedule expectations and not the old ones. 

Some things - like bribing 
officials - can differ 
because a payment that’s 
from country to country, 
illegal in one country could 
be considered a customary 
fee in another. But sexism, 
racism and discrimination 
They’re never acceptable, 
don’t work like that. 
no matter what country 
you’re in.

5. Answer: A
Sexism, racism, or other discrimination should never be tolerated, no matter what the 
circumstances. You must separate your team from discriminatory practices, even if those 
practices are normal in the country where you’re working.

6. Answer: A
The project scope management plan is a really important tool in your project. It tells you exactly 
how you’ll create the project scope, define the WBS, verify that the work has been done, and 
make changes to the scope. But it doesn’t tell you about specific assumptions that you and the 

746 

 Chapter 15

A n s w e r s

Exam Que s t ion s

practice pmp exam

team have made, or constraints on your project. To find those, you should look in the requirements 
documentation and the project scope statement.

The Scope Baseline contains the WBS and 
project scope statement, so you’ll find 
constraints and assumptions there, too!

7. Answer: A
Stakeholder Analysis is one of the tools and techniques of the Identify Stakeholders process. And 
that shouldn’t really be a surprise. After all, the goal of stakeholder analysis is to write down the 
needs of your stakeholders. Identify Stakeholders is one of the processes in the Communications 
Management knowledge area, and answer A is the definition of Communications Management.

8. Answer: C
Just because the change will help the project’s timeline doesn’t mean that it will be an overall 
benefit to the project. It’s important to check how the project will impact the other two constraints 
as part of your change request.  Once you know all the facts about the change, the change control 
board can make an informed decision about how to proceed. 

9. Answer: B
The most expensive defects are the ones introduced when the product is being designed. This is a 
little counterintuitive at first, but it really makes sense once you think about how projects are run. If 
your team introduces a defect into a product while it’s being assembled, then they have to go back 
and fix it. But if there’s a flaw in the design, then you have to halt production and go back and figure 
out all the things that flaw affected. You may have to order new parts, reassemble components, 
and maybe even go back and redesign the product from the ground up.

10. Answer: A
This question is asking you to create a forecast using estimate to complete (ETC), which uses 
CPI to project how much money is likely to be spent for the rest of the project. The first step is to 
plug the numbers into the formula EAC = BAC / CPI, which yields EAC = $80,000 / .95 = $84,210. 
That’s how much money you’re likely to spend on the project. Now you can figure out ETC = EAC - 
AC = $84,210 - $25,000 = $59,210.

Quality management is all about making sure that the product you are building conforms to your 
customer ’s requirements.  If you have done a good job of gathering and understanding those 
requirements, all of the measurements you take on your project should help you see if what you 
are building will make your clients satisfied in the end.

The work authorization system is a part of your company’s Enterprise Environmental Factors, 
and it’s generally part of any change control system. It defines how work is assigned to people. If 
work needs to be approved by specific managers, the work authorization system will make sure 
that the right people are notified when a staff member ’s work assignments change. 

15. Answer: A
There are a few really important ethical issues in this question. Your senior management was 
clear about the rules: go with the lowest bidder. And that’s what you should do. But on top of that, 
you shouldn’t choose your sellers based on perks that you’ll get—that’s called a bribe. And you 
should always refuse bribes.

16. Answer: B
Quality audits are when your company reviews your project to make sure that you are following

17. Answer: B
Some questions on the exam might ask you about how to operate in another country. In this case, 
the question is about whether or not something is a bribe. Clearly, if it’s a bribe, you can’t pay it. But 
is it? If a payment to a government official (or anyone else) is customary, then it’s not a bribe. You 
should go ahead and pay the police—as long as it’s acceptable and legal in that country.

(Sometimes a bribe isn’t money. Sometimes it’s not 100% clear if something even is a bribe. 
But if you see an exam question where you’re getting any reward for doing your normal job, 
make sure you treat that reward as a bribe - and refuse it!) 

18. Answer: D
Confronting means figuring out the cause of the problem and fixing it. That’s the best way to be 
sure that the right decision is made. 

19. Answer: D
The most important part of the Perform Quality Control process is that your team has to inspect 
each deliverable in order to verify that it meets its requirements. So what do you need to do that? 
Well, obviously you need the deliverables! And Quality Checklists are really useful too, because 
they help you inspect each deliverable. You need Work Performance Measurements, because that 
tells you how well the team is doing the job. But Validated Changes aren’t an input—they’re the 
output!

20. Answer: D
You can’t do anything about the problem until you understand it.  You should meet with the client to 
get a better understanding of what went wrong and why the product is not meeting their needs. 

21. Answer: C
Your risk register is one of the most important project management tools that you have—that’s 
why you review it and go over your risks at every meeting. Any time you come across a new risk, 
the first thing you should do is document it in the risk register. It’s really easy to lose track of risks, 
especially when you’re running a big project. By adding every risk to the register, you make sure 
that you don’t forget about any of them. So once you’ve identified the risk, what’s the next step? 
You analyze the impact and probability of the risk! That’s what the Qualitative Risk Analysis process 
is for. You shouldn’t take any other action until you’ve analyzed the risk. The reason is that it might 
turn out that the risk is very unlikely, and there might be another risk with a higher probability and 
larger impact that deserves your attention.

22. Answer: D
Tom is using a Template.  As your company completes projects, the documents created along 
the way are stored in an Organizational Process Asset library.  The WBS’s from those past 
projects can be a great way to be sure that you are thinking of all of the work that you will need 
to do from the very beginning. Your project will never match the old WBS exactly, but there could 
be work packages listed there that you might not have thought of on your own but really are 
necessary in your project. 

23. Answer: A
The project charter does several important things: it lays out the project requirements, describes 
an initial summary milestone schedule, documents the business case, and identifies initial risks, 
assumptions, and constraints. But the most important thing that a project charter does is that 
it identifies the project manager, and assigns him or her the authority necessary to get the job 
done.

While a template is 
definitely one of your 
organization’s process 
assets, it’s NOT a tool or 
technique of the Create 
WBS process. It’s an 
input!

24. Answer: B
You need to figure out the root cause of the problem if you are going to find a lasting solution 
to it.  The best choice is to meet with the manager and understand why he offered the team 
members to you and what you can do to work together to find the right people for your team.  It’s 
possible that he has some information about those staff members that make them a good fit 
after all. 

25. Answer: C
The point of total assumption is the point at which the seller assumes the costs. In a firm fixed 
price contract, this is the point where the costs have gotten so large that the seller basically runs 
out of money from the contract and has to start paying the costs.

26. Answer: C
All project reports must be communicated as formal written documents. Not only that, but 
anything that has to do with a contract DEFINITELY needs to be formal written.

If you want to evaluate how the project is doing with respect to the schedule and budget, you need to calculate 
CPI and SPI. The first step is to write down the information you have so far: BAC = $450,000, planned % 
complete = 45%, actual % complete = 40%, and AC = $165,000. Now you can calculate PV = BAC x planned 
% complete = $450,000 x 45% = $202,500. And you can calculate EV = BAC x actual % complete = $450,000 
x 40% = $180,000. Now you have the information you need to calculate CPI and SPI. CPI = EV / AC = 
$180,000 / $165,000 = 1.09, which is above 1.0—so your project is within its budget. And you can calculate 
SPI = EV / PV = $180,000 / $202,500 = .89, which is below 1.0 - so your project is behind schedule.

29. Answer: D
Sometimes Verify Scope happens before Control Scope, and sometimes it happens afterwards—and 
sometimes it happens both before AND afterwards. That actually makes a lot of sense when you look at 
what  those two processes do, and how they interact with each other. You always perform some Verify Scope 
activities at the end of your project, because you need to verify that the last deliverable produced includes all 
of the work laid out for it in the Scope Statement. Most projects will almost certainly have gone through Control 
Scope before then. So it might seem like Control Scope always happens before Verify Scope. But you don’t 
just perform Verify Scope at the end—you actually do it after every deliverable is created, to make sure that 
all the work for that deliverable was done. Not only that, but sometimes Verify Scope fails because your team 
didn’t do all of the work that was needed—that’s why Requested Changes are an output of Verify Scope. And 
if those changes include scope changes, then your project will end up going through Control Scope again—
possibly for the first time in the project, if this is the first scope change you’ve had to make. So Control Scope 
can happen before Verify Scope, but it can also happen afterward as well. That’s why there’s no prescribed 
order for those two processes: they can happen in any order.

When there’s a dispute between a buyer and a seller, that’s called a claim. Most contracts have some language 
that explains exactly how claims should be resolved—and since it’s in the contract, it’s legally binding, and both 
the buyer and seller need to follow it. Usually it’s not an option to renegotiate a contract, especially at the end 
of the project after the work is complete, and lawsuits should only be filed if there are absolutely, positively no 
other options.

When you’re performing the Close Procurements process, you’re closing out work done by a seller 
for a contract. To do that, you do a few things: you verify that all of the work and deliverables are 
acceptable, you finalize any open claims, and in case of early termination, you follow the termination 
clause in the contract. On the other hand, when you’re performing the Close Project or Phase 
process, you’re finalizing all of the various activities that you do across all of the process groups, and 
you’re also verifying that the work and deliverables are complete.

32. Answer: B
Of all of the contract types listed in the question, the Time & Materials (T&M) contract is the riskiest 
kind of contract for the buyer, because if the cost of the materials gets really high then they’re passed 
along to the buyer—and the seller doesn’t have any incentive to keep them down! (It’s true that Cost 
Plus Award Fee (CPAF) could involve paying an additional fee to the seller, but that fee is based 
entirely on the buyer ’s subjective evaluation of the seller ’s performance, which lowers the risk.)

Gold plating is when you or your team add more work to the project that was not requested by the 
sponsor or client. It is always a bad idea to gold plate a project because the impact is sometimes not 
immediately known. Sometimes, a feature that might seem really useful to your team is actually a 
detriment to the client. Gold-plated features can also introduce bugs that slow down later development. 

Unplanned work done by the team is always gold 
plating, even if it makes the client happy. But if 
the client never asked for it, it’s not scope creep 
because the project’s planned scope never changed.

A watchlist is where you keep risks that don’t have a high enough probability or impact to make it into the

enough time to come up with a risk response strategy if circumstances change as time goes on.

Verify Scope is the Monitoring & Controlling process for the Scope Management knowledge area. It

A control chart is a really valuable tool for visualizing how a process is doing over time. By taking 
one measurement after another and plotting them on a line chart, you can get a lot of great 
information about the process. Every control chart has three important lines on it: the mean (or the 
average of all data points), an upper control limit and a lower control limit. There’s an important rule 
called the Rule of Seven that helps you interpret control charts. That rule tells you that if you find 
seven consecutive measurements that are on the same side of the mean, there’s something wrong. 
That’s because it’s extremely unlikely for seven measurements like that to occur—it’s much more 
likely that there’s a problem with your process. If you can figure out an improvement to fix that, 
you’ll have a lot fewer defects to repair later!

The expected monetary value (or EMV) of the problems integrating the component is the 
probability (20%) times the cost ($3,000), but don’t forget that since it’s a risk, that number 
should be negative. So its EMV is 20% x $3,000 = -$600. The savings from not having to build 
the component from scratch is an opportunity. It has an EMV of 40% x $10,000 = $4,000. Add

To calculate the expected monetary value (EMV) of a set of risks and opportunities, multiply each 
probability by its total cost and add them together. In this question, the cost of the risk is -$15,250 
+ -$20,000 = -$35,250, so its EMV is 40% x -$35,250 = -$14,100. The value of the opportunity is 
$4,500 and its probability is 65%, so its EMV is 65% x $4,500 = $2,925. So the total EMV for the 
two is -$14,100 + $2,925 = -$11,175.

The Staffing Management plan includes a “Reward and Recognition” section that describes how you’ll reward your

There’s no such thing as a

91. Answer: C
It’s pretty obvious just from a quick glance at the numbers that this project is in trouble. The total budget for 
completion is 900 panels x $75 per panel = $67,500, and your actual costs are already $45,000. But if you look at 
all the answers, every one of them could potentially be correct: you know that you’re pretty far below budget, so the 
CPI will be below 1 and the CV will be negative. And since you should have completed 400 panels, you’re behind 
schedule, so you know your SPI will also be below 1. So which of the answers is right? There’s only one way to 
find out: do the calculations. Actual % complete is 350 ÷  900 = 38.9% so PV = $67,500 x .389 = $26,258. Planned 
% complete is 400 ÷ 900 = 44.4%, so PV = $67,500 x .444 = $29,970. CPI = $26,258 ÷ $45,000 = .584, and CV 
= $26,258 - $45,000 = -$18,742, so both of those numbers don’t match the answers for A and B. And for answer 
D, SPI = $26,258 ÷ $29,970 = .876, which doesn’t match, either. But for answer C, TCPI = ($67,500 - $26,258) ÷ 
($67,500 - $45,000) = 1.833, which does match the answer. Answer C is correct.

A resource histogram is just a way to visualize the number of people in each role that you will need on your project 
as time goes on.  Once you have figured out your schedule and the order of activities, you figure out how many 
people it’s going to take to do the work and plot that out over time.  Then you have a good idea of what the staffing 
needs of your project will be. 

Stakeholder analysis is important, but 
it’s not part of change control.

94. Answer: D
Change control is how you deal with changes to your project management plan. And a change control system is the 
set of procedures that lets you make those changes in an organized way. A typical change control system includes a 
change control board, utilizes a project management information system, and ends with either approval or rejection.

Anytime you have any communication having to do with the contract, it’s always formal written 
communication. 

96. Answer: A
One of the most important elements of the staffing management plan is the timetable, which tells 
you who will work on what, and when they will be released from the project. One of the most

Once your project team is done with the work, it’s time to check the deliverables against the 
scope statement, WBS, and scope management plan. If your deliverables have everything in 
those documents, then they should be acceptable to stakeholders. When all of the deliverables 
in the scope are done to their satisfaction, then you’re done with the project! What comes 
next? Formal acceptance, which means you have written confirmation from the stakeholders 
that the deliverables match the requirements and the project management plan. Since this 
communication is a project document, it’s formal written communication.

The most important project constraints that you’ll see on the exam are scope, quality, schedule, 
budget, resources, and risk. Any change to one of those constraints affects the others. It’s 
important to balance all of these constraints throughout your project.

Every risk should have a risk owner listed in the register. That person is responsible for keeping the 
response plan up to date and make sure the right actions are taken if the risk does occur. 

103. Answer: B
Risk mitigation means taking some sort of action that will cause a risk, if it materializes, to do as 
little damage to your project as possible. Having team members spend time doing work to prepare

Sometimes you don’t need to do any calculations when you run across a question like this. The

use the one with the lowest LS. So for activity F in the question, the following activities are G, with 
an LS of 17, and H, with an LS of 11. So the LF of F is 11 - 1 = 10.

Punishment isn’t 
usually the best way 
to handle a situation, 
but if it’s the only 
option, make sure 
you do it right.

107. Answer: A
Punishment power is exactly what it sounds like—you correct a team member for poor behavior. 
Always remember to do this one-on-one, in person, and in private! Punishing someone in front of 
peers or superiors is extremely embarrassing, and will be really counterproductive.

108. Answer: B
Since the CFO is affected by your project, that means he’s a stakeholder. The best thing you 
can do in this situation is get the new stakeholder ’s opinion incorporated in the project up front.  
It’s important that all of the project stakeholders understand the needs and objectives that the 
project is meant to address. The worst case is to have the stakeholder ’s opinion incorporated 
at the end of the project—that could mean a lot of re-work or even an entirely unacceptable 
product. 

109. Answer: D
An important part of identifying stakeholders is reviewing lessons learned from prior projects 
(because they may help you identify stakeholder issues early), performing stakeholder analysis 
(which often involves a power/interest grid), and reviewing procurement documents (because a 
contract often brings extra stakeholders with it). However, you don’t create the change control 
system in the Initiating phase—that’s something that you do as part of your project planning 
activities.

Time and Materials (T&M) contracts are used in labor contracts. In a T&M contract, the seller

And the “Materials” part means that the buyer also pays for materials, equipment, office space, 
administrative overhead costs, and anything else that has to be paid for.

When you’re looking at CPI and SPI numbers, remember: lower = loser. If your CPI is below 1.0, 
then your project is over its budget. If the SPI is below 1.0, then the project is behind schedule. 
In this case, the project is ahead of schedule, since its SPI is above 1.0. But it’s over its budget, 
because it’s got a CPI that’s below 1.0.

Pareto charts plot out the frequency of defects and sort them in descending order. The right axis

by 20% of the root causes you can identify. So if you do something about that small number of 
causes, you can have a big impact on your project.

A fixed price (FP) contract means that the buyer pays one amount regardless of how much 
it costs the seller to do the work. A fixed price contract only makes sense in cases where the 
scope is very well known. If there are any changes to the amount of work to be done, the seller 
doesn’t get paid any more to do it.

So if the costs get really high, then 
the buyer has to swallow them.

You create one of the most important outputs of your entire project when the team is doing the 
project work. Work Performance Information tells you the status of each deliverable in the project, 
what the team’s accomplished, and all of the information you need to know in order to figure out 
how your project’s going. But you’re not the only one who needs this—your team members and 
stakeholders need to know what’s going on, so they can adjust their work and correct problems 
early on.

Kaizen is a Japanese word that means “improvement”—and it’s also a management technique 
that helps your company use problem-solving to constantly find new ways to improve. Kaizen 
focuses on making small improvements and measuring their impact. It’s is a philosophy that guides 
management, rather than a particular way of doing quality assurance.

Ishikawa diagrams - or fishbone 
diagrams - are an important tool 
that’s used in Kaizen.

The PMP Code of Professional Conduct requires cultural sensitivity to others. It’s unacceptable 
to belittle anyone based on how they speak, the way they dress, or any other aspect of their 
cultural background. If you see a member of your team doing this, it’s your responsibility to do 
what’s necessary to correct the behavior and prevent it from happening in the future.

162. Answer: A
Diagramming Techniques (including Ishikawa diagrams and flowcharts) are a tool of the Identify 
Risks process. You use them to find the root cause of defects in Quality Management processes 
but they can also be useful in finding the risks that can lead to trouble in Risk Management. 

163. Answer: B
The project’s scope is changing every time the client is asked to verify the product—that’s scope 
creep.  The best way to avoid that is to be sure that the Project Scope Statement that is written 
in the planning stages of the project is understood and agreed to by everyone on the project.  
Scope changes should never come late in the project; that’s when they cost the most and will 
jeopardize the team’s ability to deliver.

166. Answer: C
When you’re asked to use benefit-to-cost (BCR) ratios to select a project, always choose the 
project with the highest BCR because that’s the project that gives you the most benefit for the 
least cost. An easy way to do it is to divide: Project A has a BCR of 5:2, and 5 / 2 is 2.5. Do that 
with all four projects, and you find that project C has the highest BCR.

Legitimate power is the kind of power you have when you tell someone who reports to you to 
do something.  Expert power is when your opinion carries weight because people know that you 
know what you’re talking about. Reward power is when you promise a reward for doing as you ask. 
Referent power is when people do what you say because of your association with somebody else. 
Punishment power is when people do what you say because they are afraid of the consequences.

Every change request needs to be evaluated to determine whether or not it should be made. That’s 
what we do in the Perform Integrated Change Control process—every change is analyzed to 
determine its impact. It’s then documented as a change request and put into the change control 
system. That’s where the stakeholders on the CCB determine if the change should be made.

169. Answer: B
By the time the Close Project or Phase process happens, you should have already gotten formal 
written acceptance for the deliverables. That’s what the Verify Scope process is for, and you verify 
that formal acceptance in the Close Project or Phase process.

170. Answer: C
The WBS work packages can be displayed by project phase or by project deliverable.  It depends 
on how your company needs to see the work organized.  If you use the same phased lifecycle for 
all projects, it can be easier to show all of the work as it breaks down within each phase. If you 
have various teams depending on the deliverables your team will produce, it can make sense to 
break the work down by project deliverable. 

171. Answer: A
The two main outputs of Direct and Manage Project Execution are Deliverables and Work 
Performance Information. Deliverables are the documents and other work products your project 
produces, and Work Performance Information is a name for all of the performance metrics and 
reports you can generate to track how your project is doing versus your plan.

Lessons learned are some of your most important organizational process assets. At the end of every 
project, you sit down with the project team and write down everything you learned about the project. 
This includes both positive and negative things. That way, when you or another project manager in 
your company plans the next project, you can take advantage of the lessons you learned on this one.

173. Answer: D
Once you’ve closed out a contract, it’s important to conduct a procurement audit. This is where you go

Ground rules help you prevent problems between team members, and let you establish working 
conditions that everyone on the team can live with. You set up the ground rules for a project to help 
guide people in their interactions with each other. Make sure you discuss the ground rules with the 
team during the kick-off meeting!

176. Answer: A
One of the most important things that you do as a project manager is to constantly monitor the project 
for changes, and take the appropriate action whenever you make a change. But changes don’t 
happen on any sort of schedule—if they did, it would make project management a whole lot easier! 
That means you need to continuously monitor your project to figure out whether or not its plans and 
scope need to change. 

You can think of Change Requests as what you get when someone finds 
a problem and needs to make a change. Once you’ve figured out whether 
or not to do that change (in Perform Integrated Change Control), you 
give the person an update on its status.

177. Answer: A
This question is basically asking you the difference between Change Requests and Change Request 
Status Updates. Change Request Status Updates are outputs from Perform Integrated Change 
Control, not Monitor & Control Project Work.

The team always needs to help you document 
the lessons learned for the project.

181. Answer: C
This question isn’t hard if you remember one really important fact: you need your team’s help when 
you’re writing the lessons learned. That’s why you can’t release the team until the lessons learned 
are documented and added to the organizational process assets. Also, the last thing you do on the 
project is close the contract. The reason for this is that you don’t want to have to wait for payment 
before releasing the team, because most contracts have payment terms that allow for some period 
of time before full payment is required. 

182. Answer: D
The kick-off meeting gets all of the stakeholders together to explain how communication will go.  
That way, everyone knows who to talk to if things go wrong or they run into any questions.

Not every change needs to be made. Before you make any change, you always need to evaluate 
its impact on the triple constraint—time, cost, and scope—and how those changes will affect the 
quality of the deliverables. Until you analyze that impact, there’s no way to know whether or not it 
makes sense to make the change.

The idea behind net present value (or NPV) is that you can compare potential projects by 
figuring out how much each one is worth to your company right now. A project’s NPV is figured 
out by coming up with how much the project is worth, and then subtracting how much it will cost. 
If you’re asked to choose between projects and given the NPV of each of them, choose the one 
with the biggest NPV. That means you’re choosing the one with the most value!

185. Answer: C
It’s easy to get change, defects, and corrective actions mixed up—they’re all words that 
sound suspiciously similar! Just remember: a defect is any deliverable that does not meet its 
requirements. A defect is NOT always caused by a mistake—defects can come from lots of 
sources, and team members’ errors only cause some defects. For example, plenty of defects 
are caused by equipment problems.

The Project Scope Statement is where you figure out exactly what your stakeholders need, and 
turn those needs into exactly what work the team will do to give them a great product.  Any 
constraints or assumptions that need to be made to determine the work need to be written down 
in the scope statement as well. 

188. Answer: C
You can figure out the actual cost that was spent on a project, even if all you’re given are some 
of the project metrics. In this case, if you only have CPI and EV, you can figure out the AC by 
writing down the formula that has all three of them: CPI = EV / AC. Now flip the formula around: 
AC = EV / CPI = $172,500 / .92 = $187,500.

Changes are found in Monitor and Control Project Work; they are approved in Perform Integrated 
Change Control, and implemented in Direct and Manage Project Execution.  When you are monitoring 
and controlling the project work, you are always looking for changes that might need to be made to 
your plan and assessing their impact. Then you present those changes to the change control board for 
approval. If they approve, you implement them in the Direct and Manage Project Execution process—
that’s where all the work gets done. 

190. Answer: A
A Work Breakdown Structure is the best way to visualize all of the work that will be done on your project.  
It divides all of the work up into work packages and shows how it fits into higher-level categories.  By 
looking at the WBS, you can communicate to other people just how much work is involved in your 
project.

191. Answer: B
Over half of the conflicts on projects come from resources, priorities, and schedules. It can be tough to 
get resources assigned to projects, especially if they have skills that are in high demand.  Sometimes 
multiple projects (and even roles within projects) are vying to get top priority. Finally, you probably don’t 
need to think too hard to remember a conflict about schedules on a project you’ve worked on—many 
projects start with overly aggressive deadlines that cause conflicts from the very beginning.

192. Answer: D
When do you gather work performance information? You do it when you’re reporting on the performance 
of the team—that’s why it’s a tool and technique of the Report Performance process. But that’s not 
something you do during Monitor and Control Risks—Work Performance Information is an input to that 
process, which means it needs to be gathered BEFORE you start monitoring and controlling your risks.

Some questions on the PMP exam will describe tools 
or techniques rather than using their names. A question 
might say “bringing in an outside party to review your

This is a tough situation for any project manager. You’ve got a problem that’s happened, and

accept it and move on—that’s only something you do with risks that have no other option. You 
have options with a problem that happens during your project. And you can’t just go to the boss, 
because you’re the project manager and it’s your job to figure out what to do. There’s no use in 
doing risk planning, because you already know the probability (100%) and impact (the cost of 
fixing the problem). So what do you do?

update your project plan and organizational process assets, and you request changes. But you 
don’t create deliverables.

When you’re planning your project, risks are still uncertain: they haven’t happened 
yet. But eventually, some of the risks that you plan for do happen. And that’s when 
you have to deal with them. There are four basic ways to handle a risk:

project risk management

22

44

11

33

 Avoid
The best thing that 
you can do with a 
risk is avoid it—if 
you can prevent it 
from happening, 
it definitely won’t 
hurt your project.

The easiest way to avoid 
this risk is to walk away 
from the cliff… but that 
may not be an option on 
this project.

 Transfer
One effective way 
to deal with a risk 
is to pay someone 
else to accept it 
for you. The most 
common way to 
do this is to buy 
insurance.

 Mitigate
If you can’t avoid the 
risk, you can mitigate it. 
This means taking some 
sort of action that will 
cause it to do as little 
damage to your project 
as possible.

 Accept
When you can’t avoid, mitigate, or transfer a risk, 
then you have to accept it. But even when you accept 
a risk, at least you’ve looked at the alternatives and 
you know what will happen if it occurs.

find all the risks

Wh e re t o lo ok f o r r isk s

A good way to understand risks for the exam is to know where they 
come from. If you start thinking about how you find risks on your 
project, it will help you figure out how to handle them. 

Here are a few things to keep in mind when you’re looking for risks:

11

You can’t always depend on all the 
resources you were promised.

22

Have you ever been promised a person, 
equipment, conference room, or some other 
resource, only to be told at the last minute that 
the resource you were depending on wasn’t 
available? What about having a critical team 
member get sick or leave the company at the 
worst possible time? Check your list of resources. 
If a resource might not be available to you when 
you need it, then that’s a risk.

33

”When you assume...”

Have you ever heard that old saying about what 
happens when you assume? At the beginning of 
the project, your team had to make a bunch of 
assumptions in order to do your estimates. But 
some of those assumptions may not actually be 
true, even though you needed to make them for 
the sake of the estimate. It’s a good thing you 
wrote them down—now it’s time to go back and 
look at that list. If you find that some of them 
that are likely to be false, then you’ve found a 
risk.

The critical path is full of risks.

Remember the critical path method from 
the Time Management chapter? Well, an 
activity on the critical path is a lot riskier 
than an activity with plenty of float, 
because any delay in that activity will delay 
the project.

I f a n a c t i v i t y t h a t ’ s n o t o n t h e c r i t i c a l 
p a t h h a s a r e a l l y s m a l l f l o a t , t h a t m e a n s

d e l a y s i n y o u r p r o j e c t .

44

Look outside your project.

Is there a new rule, regulation or law being 
passed that might affect your project? A 
new union contract being negotiated? 
Could the price of a critical component 
suddenly jump? There are plenty of things 
outside of your project that are risks—and 
if you identify them now, you can plan for 
them and not be caught off guard.

Finding risks means talking to 
your team and being creative. 
Risks can be anywhere.

These areas are a good start, but there are plenty of other places on your 
project where you can find risks. Can you think of some of them?

 Chapter 11

what’s it worth?

Ca lc u late t h e Ex pe c te d Mone t a r y Va lue o f yo u r r isk s

Okay, so you know the probability and impact of each risk. How does 
that really help you plan? Well, it turns out that if you have good numbers 
for those things, you can actually figure out how much those risks are 
going to cost your project. You can do that by calculating the Expected 
Monetary Value (or EMV) of each risk:

11

 Start with the probability and impact of each risk.

Y o u c a n f i n d t h e s e 
i n y o u r r i s k r e g i s t e r .

Risk
H igh winds
Mudslide
Wind generator is usable
Truck rental unavailable

Probability
35%
5%
15%
10%

Impact
cost $48 to replace equipment
lose $750 in damage costs
save $800 in battery costs
cost $350 for last-minute rental

22

 Take the first risk and multiply the probability by the impact. For opportunities, 
use a positive cost. For threats, use a negative one. Then do the same for the 
rest of the risks.

E v e n t h o u g h t h e 
i m p a ct o f a m u d 
s l i d e i s b i g , t h e 
p r o b a b i l i t y i s 
l o w s o t h e EM V 
i s s m a l l .

H igh w inds : 35% x - 48 = - 16.80

Muds l ide : 5% x - 750 = - 37.50

Wind ge ne rat o r: 15% x 800 = 120.00

Tr uck re n t a l : 10% x - 350 = - 35.00

The wind generator risk is an 
opportunity because you’ll save 
money if it happens. So when you 
do the EMV calculation, you use 
a positive number for the impact.

33

Now that you’ve calculated the EMV for each of the risks, you can add 
them up to find the total EMV for all of them.

EMV = - 16.80 + - 37.50 + 120.00 + - 35.00 = - 30.70

Your brain on PMP.  Here you are trying to learn something, while here 
your brain is doing you a favor by making sure the learning doesn’t stick.  Your 

brain’s thinking, “Better leave room for more important things, like which wild 
animals to avoid and whether naked snowboarding is a bad idea.” So how do you 

trick your brain into thinking that your life depends on knowing enough to get 

through the PMP exam?

Why get cer tified?

1 Tired of facing the same old problems?  If you’ve worked on 

a whole lot that project managers have learned over the years, and passing 

a lot of projects, you know that you face the same problems, over and over 

again. It’s time to learn some common solutions to those problems. There’s 

the PMP exam is your ticket to putting that wisdom into practice. Get ready to

Organizations, processes, and projects

(Keeping) In good company

If you want something done right… better hope you’re in the 

right kind of organization.   All projects are about teamwork—but how your 
team works depends a lot on the type of organization you’re in. In this chapter, you’ll 

learn about the different types of organizations around—and which type you should look

The process framework

It All Fits Together

All of the work you do on a project is made up of processes.    

Once you know how all the processes in your project fit together, it’s easy to remember 

everything you need to know for the PMP exam. There’s a pattern to all of the work that 

gets done on your project. First you plan it, then you get to work. While you are doing the 

work, you are always comparing your project to your original plan. When things start to 

get off-plan, it’s your job to make corrections and put everything back on track. And the 

process framework—the process groups and knowledge areas—is the key to all of this 

happening smoothly.

Doing the Right Stuff

Confused about eactly what you should be working on?  

Once you have a good idea of what needs to be done, you need to track your scope 

as the project work is happening. As each goal is accomplished, you confirm that all of 

the work has been done and make sure that the people who asked for it are satisfied 

with the result. In this chapter, you’ll learn the tools that help your project team set its 

goals and keep everybody on track.

6 Getting it Done on Time

Time management is what most people think of when they 

think of project managers.  It’s where the deadline is set and met. It starts with 
figuring out the work you need to do, how you will do it, what resources you’ll use, and how 

long it will take. From there, it’s all about developing and controlling that schedule.

8 Getting It Right

It’s not enough to make sure you get it done on time and under 

budget. You need to be sure you make the right product to suit your stakeholders’ 
needs.  Quality means making sure that you build what you said you would and that you 

do it as efficiently as you can.  That means trying not to make too many mistakes and 

always keeping your project working toward the goal of creating the right product!

What is quality?

You need more than just tests to figure out quality

9 Getting the Team Together

Behind every successful project is a great team.  So how do you 

make sure that you get—and keep—the best possible team for your project? You need to 

plan carefully, set up a good working environment, and negotiate for the best people you 

can find. But it’s not enough to put a good team together… If you want your project to go 

well, you’ve got to keep the team motivated and deal with any conflicts that happen along 

the way. Human resource management gives you the tools you need to get the best team 

for the job and lead them through a successful project.

That’s what running a project is like if you don’t do get a handle on communications. 

Luckily, there’s Communications Management, which is how to get everyone talking about 

the work that’s being done, so that they all stay on the same page. That way everyone has 

the information they need to resolve any issues and keep the project moving forward.

11 Planning for the Unknown

Even the most carefully planned project can run into trouble. 

No matter how well you plan, your project can always run into unexpected problems. 

Team members get sick or quit, resources that you were depending on turn out to be 

unavailable—even the weather can throw you for a loop. So does that mean that you’re 

helpless against unknown problems? No! You can use risk planning to identify potential 

problems that could cause trouble for your project, analyze how likely they’ll be to occur, 

take action to prevent the risks you can avoid, and minimize the ones that you can’t.

12 Getting Some Help

Some jobs are just too big for your company to do on its own. 

Even when the job isn’t too big, it may just be that you don’t have the expertise or 

equipment to do it. When that happens, you need to use Procurement Management to 

find another company to do the work for you. If you find the right seller, choose the right 

kind of relationship, and make sure that the goals of the contract are met, you’ll get the job 

done and your project will be a success.

13 Making Good Choices

It’s not enough to just know your stuf f. You need to 
make good choices to be good at your job. Everyone 

who has the PMP credential agrees to follow the PMP Code of Professional 

Conduct, too. The Code helps you with ethical decisions that aren’t really 

covered in the body of knowledge—and it’s a big part of the exam. Most 

of what you need to know is really straightforward, and with a little review, 

you’ll do well.

Wh at ’s a r isk?

There are no guarantees on any project! Even the simplest activity can run into 
unexpected problems. Any time there’s anything that might occur on your project 
and change the outcome of a project activity, we call that a  risk. A risk can be an 
event (like a fire), or it can be a condition (like an important part being unavailable).  
Either way, it’s something that may or may not happen... but if it does, then it will 
force you to change the way you and your team will work on the project.

A risk is any 
uncertain event 
or condition 
that might 
affect your 
project.
Not all risks 
are negative.

No t a l l r isk s a re ne g at i ve

Some events (like finding an easier way to do an 
activity) or conditions (like lower prices for certain 
materials) can help your project! When this happens, 
we call it an  opportunity… but it’s still handled just 
like a risk.

H ow yo u de a l w i t h r isk

When you’re planning your project, risks are still uncertain: they haven’t happened 
yet. But eventually, some of the risks that you plan for do happen. And that’s when 
you have to deal with them. There are four basic ways to handle a risk:

 Avoid
The best thing that 
you can do with a 
risk is avoid it—if 
you can prevent it 
from happening, 
it definitely won’t 
hurt your project.

The easiest way to avoid 
this risk is to walk away 
from the cliff… but that 
may not be an option on 
this project.

 Transfer
One effective way 
to deal with a risk 
is to pay someone 
else to accept it 
for you. The most 
common way to 
do this is to buy 
insurance.

 Mitigate
If you can’t avoid the 
risk, you can mitigate it. 
This means taking some 
sort of action that will 
cause it to do as little 
damage to your project 
as possible.

 Accept
When you can’t avoid, mitigate, or transfer a risk, 
then you have to accept it. But even when you accept 
a risk, at least you’ve looked at the alternatives and 
you know what will happen if it occurs.

By now, you should have a pretty good feel for how each of the 
planning processes work. The past few knowledge areas started 
out with their own planning process, and Risk Management 
is no different. You start with the Risk Management 
Planning process, which should look very familiar to you.

By the time a risk actually occurs on your 
project, it’s too late to do anything about it. 
That’s why you need to plan for risks from 
the beginning and keep coming back to do 
more planning throughout the project.

Are people at your company 
risk takers? Do they play 
it safe? Every company 
has people with different 
attitudes about risk.

You may get a question on 
the exam that asks which

and the other planning processes. That

The risk management

identifying and analyzing 
risks on your project.

Th e  R isk Man ageme n t P lan is t h e on l y o u t p u t

It tells you how you’re going to handle risk on your project—which 
you probably guessed, since that’s what management plans do. It 
says how you’ll assess risk on the project, who’s responsible for 
doing it, and how often you’ll do risk planning (since you’ll have to 
meet about risk planning with your team throughout the project).

The plan has parts that are really useful for managing risk:

Risk Management Plan

It has a bunch of categories that you’ll use to classify your 
risks. Some risks are technical, like a component that might 
turn out to be difficult to use. Others are external, like 
changes in the market or even problems with the weather.

You might find a Risk Breakdown Structure ( RBS) here. It’s 
a great tool for managing your risk categories. It looks like 
a WBS, except instead of tasks it shows how the risks break 
down into categories.

It’s important to come up with guidelines to help you figure 
out how big a risk’s impact is. The impact tells you how 
much damage the risk will cause to your project. A lot of 
projects classify impact on a scale from minimal to severe, 
or from very low to very high. 

The plan should also give you a scale to help figure out 
the probability of the risk. Some risks are very likely; 
others aren’t.

You should build guidelines for risk categories into your 
risk management plan, and the easiest way to do that is to 
use a risk breakdown structure (RBS). Notice how it 
looks a lot like a WBS? It’s a similar idea—you come up 
with major risk categories, and then decompose them into 
more detailed ones.

This is what an RBS looks like. 
The idea here is that you want 
to come up with a way to take

The RBS is just one way to 
categorize risks. It’s not a tool 
or technique by itself; you’ll 
include it as part of the Risk 
Management Plan.

risk planning processes

An at omy o f a R isk

Once you’re done with Risk Planning, there are four more risk 
management processes that will help you and your team come up 
with the list of risks for your project, analyze how they could affect 
your project, and plan how you and your team will respond if any of 
the risks materialize when you’re executing the project.

probability and impact of each risk.

You can’t plan for risks until you’ve figured out which ones you’re likely to run 
into. That’s why the first risk management process is Risk Identification. 
The idea is that you want to figure out every possible risk that might affect 
your project. Don’t worry about how unlikely the risk is, or how bad the 
impact would be—you’ll figure that stuff out later.

Inf o rm at ion g at h e r ing te chn ique s f o r R isk Ide n t i f ic at ion

You probably already guessed that the goal of risk identification is to identify 
risks—seems pretty obvious, right? And the most important way to identify those 
risks is to gather information from the team. That’s why the first—and most 
important—technique in Risk Identification is called  Information Gathering 
Techniques. These are time-tested and effective ways to get information from 
your team, stakeholders, and anyone else that might have information on risks.

F i ve use f u l inf o rm at ion g at h e r ing te chn ique s

There are a lot of different ways that you can find risks on your project. 
But there are only a few that you’re most likely to use—and those 
are the ones that you will run across on the exam. 

Brainstorming is the first thing you 
should do with your team. Get them all 
together in a room, and start pumping 
out ideas. Brainstorming sessions always 
have a facilitator to lead the team and 
help turn their ideas into a list of risks.

The team u sual ly come s up w ith 
ri sks that have to do w ith 
bu i ld ing the product , wh i le the 
spon sor or someone who wou ld u se 
the product w i l l th ink about how 
it cou ld end up be ing d iff icu lt to

i t ’ s j u st a d i s o r d e r l y m e e t i n g w i t h n o c l e a r g o a l .

 Interviews are a really important 
part of identifying risk. Try to find 
everyone who might have an opinion 
and ask them about what could 
cause trouble on the project. The 
sponsor or client will think about the 
project in a very different way than 
the project team.

The  Delphi technique is a way to 
get opinions and ideas from experts. This 
is another technique that uses a facilitator, 
but instead of gathering team members 
in a room, they send questionnaires to 
experts asking about important project 
risks. They take those answers and 
circulates them all to the experts—but 
each expert is kept anonymous so that 
they can give honest feedback.

The Delphi technique 
is always anonymous. 
People will give more 
honest opinions if 
they know their 
names won’t be 
attached to them.

 SWOT analysis lets you analyze 
strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, 
and threats.

 Root cause identification is analyzing each 
risk and figuring out what’s actually behind it. Even 
though falling off of the cliff and having your tent 
blow away are two separate risks, when you take a 
closer look you might find that they’re both caused by 
the same thing: high winds, which is the root cause 
for both of them. So you know that if you get high 
winds, you need to be on the lookout for both risks!

What’s the big difference between  Brainstorming and the Delphi Technique? 
Can you think of a situation where one would be more useful than the other?

you are here 4

risk identification tools

Mo re r isk ide n t i f ic at ion te chn ique s

Even though gathering information is the biggest part of risk identification, it’s not 
the only part of it. There are other tools and techniques that you’ll use to make sure 
that the risk register you put together has as many risks as possible. The more you 
know about risk going into the project, the better you’ll handle surprises when they 
happen. And that’s what these tools and techniques are for—looking far and wide 
to get every risk possible.

Documentation reviews are 
when you look at plans, requirements, 
documents from your organizational 
process assets, and any other relevant 
documents that you can find to squeeze 
every possible risk out of them.

a j um p i n g- o ff po i n t . .

Assumptions analysis is what 
you’re doing when you look over your 
project’s assumptions. Remember 
how important assumptions were 
when you were estimating the project? 
Well, now it’s time to look back at 
the assumptions you made and make 
sure that they really are things you 
can assume about the project. Wrong 
assumptions are definitely a risk.

Checklist analysis means using checklists 
that you developed specifically to help you find 
risks. Your checklist might remind you to check 
certain assumptions, talk to certain people, or 
review documents you might have overlooked. 

Diagramming techniques should be pretty familiar to you already. You 
can use the Ishikawa or Fishbone diagrams from Quality Management to help 
you find the root cause of a risk, just like you did for a defect. You can also use 
flowcharts to see how parts of your system interact—any place where they get 
complex or uncertain is a good source of risks.

The team made 
assumptions 
during planning 
to deal with

information… and

could turn out to 
be wrong.

A good way to understand risks for the exam is to know where they 
come from. If you start thinking about how you find risks on your 
project, it will help you figure out how to handle them. 

Here are a few things to keep in mind when you’re looking for risks:

11

You can’t always depend on all the 
resources you were promised.

22

Have you ever been promised a person, 
equipment, conference room, or some other 
resource, only to be told at the last minute that 
the resource you were depending on wasn’t 
available? What about having a critical team 
member get sick or leave the company at the 
worst possible time? Check your list of resources. 
If a resource might not be available to you when 
you need it, then that’s a risk.

33

”When you assume...”

Have you ever heard that old saying about what 
happens when you assume? At the beginning of 
the project, your team had to make a bunch of 
assumptions in order to do your estimates. But 
some of those assumptions may not actually be 
true, even though you needed to make them for 
the sake of the estimate. It’s a good thing you 
wrote them down—now it’s time to go back and 
look at that list. If you find that some of them 
that are likely to be false, then you’ve found a 
risk.

The critical path is full of risks.

Remember the critical path method from 
the Time Management chapter? Well, an 
activity on the critical path is a lot riskier 
than an activity with plenty of float, 
because any delay in that activity will delay 
the project.

I f a n a c t i v i t y t h a t ’ s n o t o n t h e c r i t i c a l 
p a t h h a s a r e a l l y s m a l l f l o a t , t h a t m e a n s

b e c o m e c r i t i c a l — w h i c h c o u l d l e a d t o b i g 
d e l a y s i n y o u r p r o j e c t .

44

Look outside your project.

Is there a new rule, regulation or law being 
passed that might affect your project? A 
new union contract being negotiated? 
Could the price of a critical component 
suddenly jump? There are plenty of things 
outside of your project that are risks—and 
if you identify them now, you can plan for 
them and not be caught off guard.

Finding risks means talking to 
your team and being creative. 
Risks can be anywhere.

These areas are a good start, but there are plenty of other places on your 
project where you can find risks. Can you think of some of them?

Now p u t i t in t h e r isk re g is te r

The point of the Risk Identification process is to… well, identify risks. But what 
does that really give you? You need to know enough about each risk to analyze it 
and make good decisions about how to handle it. So when you’re doing interviews, 
leading brainstorming sessions, analyzing assumptions, gathering expert opinions 
with the Delphi technique, and using the other Risk Identification tools and 
techniques, you’re gathering exactly the things you need to add to the risk register.

R ank yo u r r isk s

It’s not enough to know that  risks are out there. You can identify risks all day long, 
and there’s really no limit to the number of risks you can think of. But some of them 
are likely to occur, while others are very improbable. It’s the ones that have much 
better odds of happening that you really want to plan for.

Besides, some risks will cause a whole lot of damage to your project if they happen, 
while others will barely make a scratch… and you care much more about the risks 
that will have a big impact. That’s why you need the next risk management process, 
 Qualitative Risk Analysis—so you can look at each risk and figure out how 
likely it is and how big its impact will be.

A good way to figure out whether 
a risk is likely is to look at lessons 
learned and see if it happened before.

Not all risks are created equal. Some of them are really likely to 
happen, while others are almost impossible. One risk will cause a 
catastrophe on your project if it happens; another will just waste a 
few minutes of someone’s time. 

Risk data quality assessment means 
making sure that the information you’re using in your 
risk assessment is accurate. Sometimes it makes sense 
to bring in outside experts to check out the validity 
of your risk assessment data. Sometimes you can 
even confirm the quality of the data on your own, by 
checking some sample of it against other data sources.

Risk urgency assessment is checking out 
how soon you’re going to need to take care of a 
particular risk. If a risk is going to happen soon, you’d 
better have a plan for how to deal with it soon, too.

Risk probability and impact assessment 
One of the best ways to be sure that you’re handling your 
risks properly is to examine how likely they are to happen, 
and how bad (or good) it will be if they do. This process 
helps you assign a probability to the likelihood of a risk 
occurring, and then figure out the actual cost (or impact) 
if it does happen. You can use these values to figure out 
which of your risks need a pretty solid mitigation plan, 
and which can monitored as the project goes on. 

project risk management

Risk categorization is all about grouping 
your risks so that you can come up with a better 
strategy for dealing with them. You might group 
them by the phase of the project where you’ll see 
them or by the source of the risk.  Or you could 
come up with a bunch of additional categories that 
would help you to organize your response better 
and be ready for the risk if it should happen. 

C r e a t i n g r i s k c a t e g o r i e s c a n h e l p y o u 
d e a l w i t h w h o l e g r o u p s o f r i s k s i n o n e 
r e s p o n s e p l a n .  

Qualitative Risk Analysis 
helps you prioritize each 
risk and figure out its 
probability and impact.

Sometimes you’ll find that some risks have 
obviously low probability and impact, so you won’t 
put them in your register. Instead, you can add 
them to a watchlist, which is just a list of risks, 
like those you don’t want to forget about, but 
you don’t need to track as closely. You’ll check 
your watchlist from time to time to keep an eye 
on things.

Probability and impact matrix is a table 
where all of your risks are plotted out according to 
the values you assign. It’s a good way of looking at 
the data so you can more easily make judgments 
about which risks require response. The ones with 
the higher numbers are more likely to happen and 
will have a bigger impact on  your project if they 
do.  So you’d better figure out how to handle those.

This gives you a good picture of the 
threshold the company has set for 
evaluating risks.

1. The organizational process assets at your company set a high-pr ior ity r isk as any r isk with a Probability and 
Impact score higher than 0.20.  Medium-pr ior ity r isks are those between 0.10 and 0.19, and low-pr ior ity are those 
between 0–0.09. Low-pr ior ity r isks can be monitored on a watchlist, but H igh and Medium ones must have a  
response strategy. 
Fill in the missing values in the Priority and Probability columns in the risk register on the right, using the 
Probability and Impact matrix to figure out which ones are low, medium or high. For example, we filled 
in “High” under Priority for row #3 by look ing up risk (“No truck”) in the first table, finding the probability 
and impact values, and then using the  Probability & Impact Matrix. The probability is .3 and the impact is 
.7, so you can find the corresponding box in the matrix. Since it ’s dark gray, its priority is “High.”

2  After analyzing your data, you came up with three r isk categor ies for the project: natural, equipment, and human. 
Fill in the missing values in the “Category” column of the risk register with either “Natural,” “Equipment,” 
or “Human.” We star ted you out by filling in a few of them.

3.  For this par ticular project, you’ll need the equipment at the star t of the project, so any equipment r isks are 
considered high urgency. Natural and human r isks are all medium urgency, except for ones that have to do with 
storms, which you consider low urgency for this project because of limited mitigation potential. 
Figure out the whether the urgency for each risk is “Low,” “Medium,” or “High” and fill in the “Urgency” 

column in the risk register.

 Chapter 11

project risk management

Q:   Who does qualitative risk analysis?
A:   The whole team needs to work on it together. 
The more of your team members who are helping to 
think of possible risks, the better off your plan will be. 
Everybody can work together to think of different risks to 
their particular part of the work, and that should give an 
accurate picture of what could happen on the project. 
Q:  What if people disagree on how to rank risks?
A:  There are a lot of ways to think about risks. If a risk 
has a large impact on your part of the project or your goals, 
you can bet that it will seem more important to you than 
the stuff that affects other people in the group. The best 
way to keep the right perspective is to keep everybody on 
the team evaluating risks based on how they affect the 
overall project goals. If everyone focuses on the effect 
each risk will have on the cost, quality, and scope of your 
project, risks will get ranked in the order that is best for 
everybody.
Q:  Where do the categories come from?
A:  You can create categories however you want.  
Usually, people categorize risks in ways that help them 
come up with response strategies. Some people use 
project phase. That way, they can come up with a risk 
mitigation plan for each phase of a project, and they 
can cut down on the information they need to manage 
throughout. Some people like to use the source of the risk 
as a category. If you do that, you can find mitigation plans 
that can help you deal with each source separately.  That 
might come in handy if you are dealing with a bunch of 
different contractors or suppliers and you want to manage 
the risks associated with each separately. 
Q:  How do I know if I’ve got all the risks?
A:  Unfortunately, you never know the answer to that 
one. That’s why it’s important to keep monitoring your 
risk register throughout the project. It’s important that you 
are constantly updating it and that you never let it sit and 
collect dust. You should be looking for risks throughout all 
phases of your project, not just when you’re starting out.

Q:  I’m still not clear on the difference between 
Delphi and brainstorming. 
A:  It’s easy to get those two confused because both 
are about people sitting and thinking of risks. Delphi is 
a technique where you ask experts to give their opinion 
anonymously, and then you evaluate those opinions. 
Brainstorming is just you and your team sitting in a room 
thinking of risks. 
Q:  What’s the point in even tracking low-priority 
risks? Why have a watchlist at all?
A:  Actually, watchlists are just a list of all of the risks 
that you want to monitor as the project goes on. You might 
be watching them to see if conditions change and make 
them more likely to happen. By keeping a watchlist, you 
make sure that all of the risks that seem low priority when 
you are doing your analysis get caught before they cause 
serious damage if they become more likely later in the 
project. 

The conditions that cause a risk are called triggers. So, 
say you have a plan set up to deal with storms, and you 
know that you might track a trigger for lightning damage, 
such as a thunderstorm. If there’s no thunderstorm, it’s 
really unlikely that you will see lightning damage, but once 
the storm has started, the chance for the risk to occur 
skyrockets.
Q:  I still don’t get the difference between priority 
and urgency.
A:  Priority tells you how important a risk is, while 
urgency tells you when you need to deal with it. Some 
risks could be high priority but low urgency, which means 
that they’re really important, but not time-critical. For 
example, you might know that a certain supplier that 
provides critical equipment will go out of business in six 
months, and you absolutely need to find a new supplier. 
But you have six months to do it. Finding a new supplier 
is a high priority, because your project will fail if it’s not 
taken care of. But it’s not urgent—even if it takes you four 
months to find a new supplier, nothing bad will happen.

qualitative vs quantitative

Qua l i t at i ve vs . quan t i t at i ve an a l ys is

Let’s say you’re a fitness trainer, and your specialty is helping 
millionaires get ready for major endurance trials. You get paid the 
same for each job, but the catch is that you only get paid if they 
succeed. Which of these clients would you take on?

Running a Marathon

vs.

Climbing Mount Everest

One client wants you to help him 
train so that he can finish a 
marathon. He doesn’t have to win, 
just get to the finish line.

A n o t h e r c l i e n t w a n t s y o u to h e l p h i m

t h e s u m m i t .

It’s much more likely that you can get even an 
out‑of‑shape millionaire to finish a marathon 
than it is that you can get him to climb Mount 
Everest successfully.

In fact, since the 1950s, 10,000 people have attempted 
to climb Mount Everest, and only 1,200 have succeeded. 
200 have died. Your qualitative analysis probably told 
you that the climbing project would be the riskier of the

is what quantitative analysis is all about.

Once you’ve  identified risks and ranked them according to the team’s 
assessment, you need to take your analysis a little further and make 
sure that the numbers back you up. Sometimes you’ll find that your 
initial assessment needs to be updated when you look into it further.

F i rs t g at h e r t h e dat a…

Quantitative tools are broken down into two categories: the ones that 
help you get more information about risks and the ones that help you to 
analyze the information you have. The tools for gathering data focus on 
gathering numbers about the risks you have already identified and ranked.

Interviewing
Sometimes the best way to get hard data about your risks is to 
interview people who understand them. In a risk interview, you 
might focus on getting three-point cost estimates so that you can 
come up with a budget range that will help you mitigate risks later. 
Another good reason to interview is to establish ranges of probability 
and impact, and document the reasons for the estimates on both 
sides of the range. 

Probability distribution
Sometimes taking a look at your time and cost estimate ranges in 
terms of their distribution will help you generate more data about 
them. You probably remember these distribution curves from your 
probability and statistics classes in school. Don’t worry, you won’t be 
asked to remember the formal definition of probability distributions 
or even to be able to create them. You just need to know that they 
are another way of gathering data for quantitative analysis. 

Exper t judgment
It’s always a good idea to contact the experts 
if you have access to them. People who have 
a good handle on statistics or risk analysis 
in general are always helpful when you are 
doing quantitative analysis. Also, it’s great 
to hear from anybody who has a lot of 
experience with the kind of project you are 
creating, too.

… t h e n an a l yze i t

Now that you have all the data you can get about your risk register, it’s 
time to analyze that information. Most of the tools for analyzing risk 
data are about figuring out how much the risk will end up costing you. 

project risk management

Sensitivity analysis is all about looking at the effect one 
variable might have if you could completely isolate it. You might 
look at the cost of a windstorm on human safety, equipment loss, 
and tent stability without taking into account other issues that 
might accompany the windstorm (like rain damage or possible 
debris from nearby campsites). People generally use tornado 
diagrams to look at a project’s sensitivity to just one risk factor.

The tornado diagram lets you look at just one 
uncertain factor while assuming that all other 
data will stay where you expect it to.

Expected monetary value analysis lets you examine 
costs of all of the paths you might take through the project 
depending on which risks occur and assign a monetary value to 
each decision. So, if it costs $100 to survey the cliff and $20 to 
stake your tent, choosing to stake your tent after you’ve looked at 
the cliff has an expected monetary value of $120.
The main method of Expected Monetary value analysis you need 
to know for the test is Decision Tree Analysis. For decision 
tree analysis, you just diagram out all of the decisions you think 
you will need to make to deal with risks. Then you add up all that 
you would need to spend to make each decision. 

The wind’s blowing at 31 mph 
SE. I weigh 153 lbs. According 
to my simulations, I have a 28.3% 
chance of falling off the cliff in 
these conditions. 

Quantitative analysis means taking 
measurements and coming up with exact 
numbers to describe your risks.

We ’ l l t a l k a b o u t

Modeling and distribution. It’s also a good idea to run 
your project risks through modeling programs if you can. Monte 
Carlo analysis is one such tool that can randomize the outcomes 
of your risks and the probabilities of them occurring to help you 
get a better sense of how to handle the risks you have identified. 

This is the same 
technique you learned 
in Chapter 6 for cost 
estimation.

Okay, so you know the probability and impact of each risk. How does 
that really help you plan? Well, it turns out that if you have good numbers 
for those things, you can actually figure out how much those risks are 
going to cost your project. You can do that by calculating the Expected 
Monetary Value (or EMV) of each risk:

11

 Start with the probability and impact of each risk.

Y o u c a n f i n d t h e s e

Impact
cost $48 to replace equipment
lose $750 in damage costs
save $800 in battery costs
cost $350 for last-minute rental

22

 Take the first risk and multiply the probability by the impact. For opportunities, 
use a positive cost. For threats, use a negative one. Then do the same for the 
rest of the risks.

Wind ge ne rat o r: 15% x 800 = 120.00

Tr uck re n t a l : 10% x - 350 = - 35.00

The wind generator risk is an 
opportunity because you’ll save 
money if it happens. So when you 
do the EMV calculation, you use 
a positive number for the impact.

33

Now that you’ve calculated the EMV for each of the risks, you can add 
them up to find the total EMV for all of them.

EMV = - 16.80 + - 37.50 + 120.00 + - 35.00 = - 30.70

You’ll need to know how to do EMV calculations for the test. Give 
them a shot now—they ’re pretty easy once you get the hang of 
them.

1.  Calculate the EMV for each of these three r isks.

2.  I f these are the only r isks on the project, calculate the total EMV.

3.  The latest weather repor t came out, and there is now a 20% chance of unseasonably 
warm weather. What ’s the new EMV for the project?

4.  Now the cost of replacement rations goes up to $150. What ’s the new EMV for the 
project?

There’s another way to do EMV—you can do it visually using something 
called a decision tree. This decision tree shows the hidden costs of 
whether or not you buy a heavier tent. The tent is more expensive—it 
costs $350, while the lighter tent costs $130. But the heavier tent has better 
protection against the wind, so if there are high winds, your equipment  
isn’t damaged. 

If you buy a heavy tent, then it protects 
your equipment better, but it’ll cost more. 
You figure that if there are high winds, 
you’ll lose $953 worth of equipment with a 
light tent, but only $48 worth if you have 
a heavy one. If there are low winds, then 
you’ll only lose $15 worth with a light tent 
and $10 worth with a heavy tent.

EMV = 35% x -$953 
-$333.55 

Low Winds

-$15

EMV = 65% x -$15

The national weather 
service says there’s a 
35% chance of high winds, 
which means there’s a 
65% chance of low winds.

+ $ 3 3 3 . 5 5 = $4 6 3 . 5 5

What’s the EMV – or how much it’s likely to cost you – of choosing the heavier tent?

If we add the EMV for high winds plus the EMV for low winds to the 
cost of the tent, we’ll figure out the “real” cost of choosing the heavier 
tent. So that’s -$16.80 + -$6.50 + -$350 = -$373.30.

Compare that with the EMV of choosing the lighter tent. Which decision makes sense?

We can do the same thing for the bottom two branches of the tree. The 
“cheaper” tent costs -$130 + -$333.55 + -$9.75 = $473.30. So it’s 
actually more expensive!

This is just the EMV of the 
low winds if you buy the 
heavier tent. The probability 
of low winds is 65%, and the 
cost is $10. So it’s just like 
the other EMV calculations: 
65% x -$10 = -$6.50.

Q:   I still don’t get this Monte Carlo 
stuff. What’s the deal?
A:   All you really need to know about 
Monte Carlo analysis for the test is that it’s 
a way that you can model out random data 
using software. In real life, though, it’s a 
really cool way of trying to see what could 
happen on your project if risks do occur. 
Sometimes modeling out the data you 
already have about your project helps you to 
see better the real impact of a risk if it  
did happen.
Q:  I can figure out how much the 
risk costs using EMV, or I can do it with 
Decision Tree Analysis. Why do I need 
two ways to do this?

Answers on page 555.

A:  That’s a good question. If you take a 
really careful look at how you do Decision 
Tree Analysis, you might notice something... 
it’s actually doing exactly the same thing as 
EMV. It turns out that those two techniques 
are really similar, except that EMV does it 
using numbers and Decision Tree Analysis 
spells out the same calculation using  
a picture.
Q:  I understand that  EMV and 
decision trees are related, but I still don’t 
exactly see how.
A:  It turns out that there are a lot of EMV 
techniques, and decision tree analysis is just 
one of them. But it’s the one you need to 
know for the test, because it’s the one that 

helps you make decisions by figuring out 
the EMV for each option. You can bet that 
you’ll see a question or two that asks you 
to calculate the EMV for a project based on 
decision tree like the one on the facing page. 
As long as you remember that risks are 
negative numbers and that opportunities are 
positive ones, you should do fine.
Q:  So are both quantitative analysis 
and qualitative analysis really just 
concerned with figuring out the impact 
of risks?
A:  That’s right. Qualitative analysis 
focuses on the impact as the team judges it 
in planning. Quantitative analysis focuses on 
getting the hard numbers to back up  
those judgments.

The main output of all of the risk management planning processes is an updated risk register. 

The first step in risk management is  Risk Identification, where you work with the whole team to figure 
out what risks could affect your project.

Qualitative and quantitative analysis are all about ranking risks based on their probability and impact. 

Qualitative analysis is where you take the categories in your risk plan and assign them to each of the 
risks that you’ve identified.

Quantitative analysis focuses on gathering numbers to help evaluate risks and make the best 
decisions about how to handle them. 

 Decision Tree Analysis is one kind of Expected Monetary Value analysis. It focuses on adding up 
all of the costs of a decisions being made on a project so that you can see the overall value of risk 
responses. 

To calculate EMV, be sure to treat all negative risks as negative numbers and all opportunities as 
positive ones. Then add up all of the numbers on your decision tree. 

Don’t forget  watchlists. They let you monitor lower-priority risks so that you can see if triggers for those 
risks occur and you need to treat them as higher priorities. 

All of the processes in Risk Management are planning or control processes. There are no executing 
processes here. Since the goal is to plan for risks, there is no need to focus on actually doing the work. 
By then, it’s too late to plan for risks.

Your risk register should include 
both threats and opportunities. 
Opportunities have positive impact 
values, while threats have negative 
ones. Don’t forget the plus 
or minus sign when you’re 
calculating EMV.

planning risk responses

H ow do yo u re sp ond t o a r isk?

After all that analysis, it’s time to figure out what you’re going to do if a 
risk occurs. Maybe you’ll be able to keep a reserve of money to handle 
the cost of the most likely  risks. Maybe there’s some planning you can do 
from the beginning to be sure that you avoid it. You might even find a way 
to transfer some of the risk with an insurance policy.

However you decide to deal with each individual risk, you’ll update your 
risk responses in the risk register to show your decisions when you’re done. 
When you’re done with Risk Response planning, you should be able 
to tell your change control board what your response plans are and who 
will be in charge of them so they can use them to evaluate changes.

Remember the strategies for handling negative risks—avoid, mitigate, 
transfer, and accept—from earlier? Well, there are strategies for handling 
positive risks, too. The difference is that   strategies for positive risks 
are all about how you can try to get the most out of them. The strategies for 
handling negative and positive risks are the tools and techniques for the  Risk 
Response Planning process.

The strategies for negative risks 
are also tools & techniques for this 
process. They’re the ones you already 
learned: avoid, mitigate, transfer and 
accept. Acceptance is a technique for 
both negative and positive risks.

 Exploit
This is when you do everything you can to make 
sure that you take advantage of an opportunity. 
You could assign your best resources to it. Or 
you could allocate more than enough funds to 
be sure that you get the most out of it.

This is when you try to make the opportunity 
more probable by influencing its triggers. If 
getting a picture of a rare bird is important, 
then you might bring more food that it’s 
attracted to.

Sometimes it’s harder to take advantage of an 
opportunity on your own. Then you might call 
in another company to share in it with you. 

 Accept
Just like accepting a negative risk, sometimes an  
opportunity just falls in your lap. The best thing 
to do in that case is to just accept it!

  Secondary risks are risks that come from 
a response you have to another risk. If you dig 
a trench to stop landslides from taking out your 
camp, it’s always possible for someone to fall 
into the trench and get hurt. 

  Residual Risks are those that remain after 
your risk responses have been implemented. So 
even though you reinforce your tent stakes and 
get weatherproof gear, there’s still a chance 
that winds could destroy your camp if they are 
strong enough. 

I get it. So, I have to go back and analyze 
secondary risks. But residual risks just sit 
there, so I can deal with them later.

If the weather’s good, then there’s a chance you could see a meteor 
shower. If the team gets a photo that wins the meteor photo contest, 
you can get extra funding. You have your team stay up all night with 
their telescopes and cameras ready.

You hear that it’s going to rain for the first three days of your trip, so 
you bring waterproof tents and indoor projects for the team to work 
on in the meantime. 

You read that there’s a major bear problem in the spring on the cliff 
where you are planning to work. You change your project start date to 
happen in the fall. 

On your way up the cliff, you meet another team that is looking to 
survey the area. You offer to do half of the surveying work while they 
do the other half and then trade your findings with one another. 

There’s a high probability of water damage to some of your 
equipment, so you buy insurance to avoid losses.

There’s always the chance that someone could make a mistake and 
fall off the cliff. No matter how much you plan for the unexpected, 
sometimes mistakes happen. 

About 10 years ago a really rare bird, the black-throated blue warbler, 
was seen on this cliff. If you could get a picture of it, it would be 
worth a lot of money. So, you bring special seeds that you have read 
are really attractive to this bird, and you set up lookout points around 
the cliff with cameras ready to get the shot.

You guessed it— more updates to the  risk register. All of your risk responses will 
be tracked through change control. Changes that you need to make to the plan 
will get evaluated based on your risk responses, too. It’s even possible that some 
of your risk responses will need to be added into your contract. 

Every risk needs to 
have one person who

who is that guy?

Risk Management Exposed

This week’s interview:

Stick figure who hangs out on clif fs

Head First: We’ve seen you hanging out on cliffs 
for a while now. Apparently, you’ve been paying 
people to stand on the cliff for you or getting a 
friend to hold a trampoline at the foot of the cliff; 
we’ve even seen you jump off of it. So now that I’ve 
finally got a chance to interview you, I want to ask 
the question at the top of everyone’s mind: “Are you 
insane? Why do you spend so much time up there?”
Stick Figure: First off, let me dispel a few myths 
that are flying around out there about me. I’m not 
crazy, and I’m not trying to get myself killed! Before 
Risk Management entered my life I, like you, would 
never have dreamed of doing this kind of thing. 
Head First: Okay, but I’m a little skeptical about 
your so-called “Risk Management.” Are you trying 
to say that because of Risk Management you don’t 
have to worry about the obvious dangers of being up 
there?
Stick Figure: No. Of course not! That’s not the 
point at all. Risk Management means you sit down 
and make a list of all of the things that could go 
wrong. (And even all the things that could go right.) 
Then you really try to think of the best way to deal 
with anything unexpected. 
Head First: So you’re doing this Risk Management 
stuff to make it less dangerous for you?
Stick Figure: Yes, exactly! By the time I’m standing 
up there on that cliff, I’ve really thought my way 
through pretty much everything that might happen 
up there. I’ve thought through it both qualitatively 
and quantitatively. 

Head First: Quantitatively?
Stick Figure: Yes. You don’t think I’d go up there 
without knowing the wind speed, do you? Chance 
of landslides? Storms? The weight of everything 
I’m carrying? How likely I am to fall in weather 
conditions? I think about all of that and I measure 
it. Then I sit down and come up with risk response 
strategies. 
Head First: OK, so you have strategies. Then 
what?
Stick Figure: Then I constantly monitor my risks 
while I’m on the cliff. If anything changes, I check to 
see if it might trigger any of the risks I’ve come up 
with. Sometimes I even discover new risks while I’m 
up there. When I do, I just add them to the list and 
work on coming up with responses for them.
Head First: I see. So you’re constantly updating 
your list of risks.
Stick Figure: Yes! We call it a Risk Register. 
Whenever I have new information, I put it there. 
It means that I can actually hang out on these cliffs 
with a lot of confidence. Because, while you can’t 
guarantee that nothing will go wrong, you can be 
prepared for whatever comes your way.
Head First: That’s a lot of work. Does it really 
make a difference?
Stick Figure: Absolutely! I’d never be able to sleep 
at night knowing that I could fall off the cliff at any 
time. But I’ve planned for the risks, and I’ve taken 
steps to stay safe… and I sleep like a baby.

There have been reports of 
bears causing problems for 
people around here lately. 
Be careful out here.

Even the best planning can’t predict 
everything—there’s always a chance that 
a new risk could crop up that you hadn’t 
thought about. That’s why you need to 
constantly monitor how your project is 
doing compared to your risk register. If a 
new risk happens, you have a good chance 
of catching it before it causes serious 
trouble. When it comes to risk, the earlier 
you can react, the better for everybody. 
And that’s what the Risk Monitoring 
and Control process is all about.

Risks responses are treated just like changes. You monitor the project in every 
status meeting to see how the risks in the risk register are affecting it. If you need 
to implement a risk response, you take it to your change control board because it 
amounts to a change that will affect cost, quality, or schedule.

Risk monitoring 
should be done 
at every status 
meeting.

project risk management

H ow t o c on t ro l yo u r r isk s

Controlling risks means keeping your finger on the pulse of the project. If you 
are constantly reviewing all of the data your project is producing, you will be able 
to react quickly if a new risk is uncovered or if it looks like one of your response 
strategies needs to spring into action. Without careful monitoring, even your best 
plans won’t get implemented in time to save your project if a risk happens. 

Risk reassessment 
You should have some regularly scheduled reassessment meetings to 
go over all of the information you have to date and see if your risk 
register still holds true. In a reassessment, your main goal is to find 
any new risks that have come up. That’s why it’s important to re-
assess your risk register every so often and be sure that all of the risks 
in it are still the right ones. 

Variance and trend analysis
Comparing the actual project performance to the plan is a great 
way to tell if a risk might be happening. If you find that you’re 
significantly over budget or behind schedule, a risk could have 
cropped up that you didn’t take into account. Looking for trends in 
your defects or schedule variance, for example, might show patterns 
that indicate that risks have occurred before you would have found 
that out on your own.

Reserve analysis
Just like you keep running tabs on your budget, you should always 
know how much money you have set aside for risk response. As you 
spend it, you should be sure to subtract it so you know if you have 
enough to cover all of your remaining risks. If you start to see that 
your reserves are running low and there are still a lot of risks being 
identified, you might be in trouble. Keeping tabs on your reserve 
means that you will always know if you need to reserve more funds 
or make different choices about how to handle risks as they come up.

risk monitoring

Mo re r isk mon i t o r ing and c on t ro l te chn ique s 

There are just a few more tools in the Risk Monitoring and Controlling 
process. They’re all focused on finding new risks if they crop up, dealing with 
changes to the risks you’ve already planned for, and responding quickly to 
risks you know how to handle. 

Never stop looking 
for new risks and 
adapting your 
strategies for 
dealing with them.

Risk audits are when you have an outside party come 
in and take a look at your risk response strategies to judge 
how effective they are. Sometimes risk audits will point 
out better ways of handling a specific risk so that you can 
change your response strategy going forward. 

A u d i t o r s w i l l a l s o l o o k a t h o w 
e ff e c t i v e y o u r o v e r a l l p r o c e s s e s 
fo r r i s k p l a n n i n g a r e .

Technical performance measurement means 
comparing the performance of your project with its planned 
performance. So if you expected to hit a specific milestone, you 
could check performance information on your product at that time 
to see if it measured up to the plan. If not, that might indicate that 
there are risks you didn’t plan for. 

Status meetings are the most important way to keep the 
team up to date on risk planning—so important that they should 
happen throughout the entire project. The more you talk 
about risks with the team, the better. Every single status meeting 
should have risk review on the agenda. Status meetings are a really 
important way of noticing when things might go wrong, and of 
making sure that you implement your response strategy in time. 
It’s also possible that you could come across a new opportunity by 
talking to the team.

prepare for the unknown

Q:  Why do I need to ask about risks at 
every status meeting?
A:  Because a risk could crop up at any 
time, and you need to be prepared. The 
better you prepare for risks, the more secure 
your project is against the unknown. That’s 
also why the triggers and watchlists are 
really important. When you meet with your 
team, you should figure out if a trigger for a 
risk response has happened. And you should 
check your watchlist to make sure none of 
your low-priority risks have materialized. 

For the test, you need to know that status 
meetings aren’t just a place for you to sit 
and ask each member of your team to tell 
you their status. Instead, you use them to 
figure out decisions that need to be made to 
keep the project on track or to head off any 
problems that might be coming up. In your 
status meetings, you need to discuss all of 
the issues that involve the whole team and 
come up with solutions to any new problems 
you encounter. So, it makes sense that you 
would use your status meetings to talk about 
your risk register and make sure that it is 
always up to date with the latest information. 
Q:   I still don’t get trend analysis. How 
does it help me find risks?
A:   It’s easy to miss risks in your 
project—sometimes all the meetings in the 
world won’t help your team see some of 
them. That’s why a tool like trend analysis 
can be really useful. Remember the control 
chart from the Quality Management chapter? 
This is really similar, and it’s just as valuable. 
It’s just a way to see if things are happening 
that you did not plan for.

Q:  Hey, didn’t you talk about risks 
back in the Time Management chapter 
too?
A:  Wow—it’s great that you remembered 
that! The main thing to remember about risks 
from the Time Management chapter is that 
having multiple critical paths means you 
have a riskier project. The riskiest is when all 
of the activities are on the critical path. That 
means that a delay to even one activity can 
derail your whole project. 
Q:  Shouldn’t I ask the sponsor about 
risks to the project?
A:  Actually the best people to ask about 
risks is the project team itself. The sponsor 
knows why the project is needed and how 
much money is available for it, but from 
there, it’s really up to the team to manage 
risks. Since you are the ones doing the 
work, it makes sense that you would have 
a better idea of what has gone wrong on 
similar projects and what might go wrong on 
this one. Risk Identification, analysis, and 
response planning are some of the most 
valuable contributions the team makes to the 
project. They can be the difference between 
making the sponsor happy and having to do 
a lot of apologizing.
Q:  Why do we do risk audits?
A:  Risk audits are when you have 
someone from outside your project come in 
and review your risk register—your risks and 
your risk responses—to make sure you got 
it right. The reason we do it is because risks 
are so important that getting a new set of 
eyes on them is worth the time.

Q:  Hold on, didn’t we already talk 
about reserves way back in Cost Control? 
Why is it coming up here?
A:  That’s right, back in Chapter 7 we 
talked about a management reserve, which 
is money set aside to handle any unknown 
costs that come up on the project. That’s 
a different kind of reserve than the one for 
controlling risks. The kind of reserve used 
for risks is called a contingency reserve, 
because its use is contingent on a risk 
actually materializing. 

Project managers sometimes talk about both 
kinds of reserves together, because they 
both have to show up on the same budget. 
When they do, you’ll sometimes hear talk of 
“known unknowns” and “unknown unknowns.” 
The management reserve is for unknown 
unknowns—things that you haven’t planned 
for but could impact your project. The 
contingency reserve is for known unknowns, 
or risks that you know about and explicitly 
planned for and put in your risk register.

The better you 
prepare for risks, 
the more secure 
your project 
is against the 
unknown.

Que s t ion C l in ic: Th e “Wh ich - is-NOT” Que s t ion

You’ll see some questions on the exam that list inputs, 
outputs, tools, or concepts and ask you to determine which one of them is 
not part of the group. Usually, you can figure them out by going through the 
answer choices one by one and eliminating the one that doesn’t belong.

This is the one with 
tornado diagrams. It’s got 
to be part of the Group.

This one is definitely a quantitative 
analysis technique. Multiplying 
probability with the value of positive 
and negative outcomes of the project 
is all about putting numbers to risk.
Hmm. This one doesn’t look quite 
right. It’s about numbers. But it isn’t 
concerned with assigning numbers to 
the risk. It’s about assigning numbers 
to the  contingency reserve. This 
might be the right answer.

117. Which of the following is not a 
 Quantitative Analysis technique?
A.
 Sensitivity analysis
B.
Expected monetary value
C.
 Reserve analysis
D.
Monte Carlo analysis

D has to be the answer! This one is about 
using random numbers to model out possible 
risks on the project. It’s definitely a part 
of quantitative analysis.

Take your time and think your way through 
it. All of them will have something in common but 
one. As long as you remember the group you’re 
fitting them into, you won’t have any trouble.

Which risk response technique is being used in these situations? Match each technique to its scenario.

If the weather’s good, then there’s a chance you could see a meteor 
shower. If the team gets a photo that wins the meteor photo contest, 
you can get extra funding. You have your team stay up all night with 
their telescopes and cameras ready.

You hear that it’s going to rain for the first three days of your trip, so 
you bring waterproof tents and indoor projects for the team to work 
on in the meantime. 

You read that there’s a major bear problem in the spring on the cliff 
where you are planning to work. You change your project start date to 
happen in the fall. 

On your way up the cliff, you meet another team that is looking to 
survey the area. You offer to do half of the surveying work while they 
do the other half and then trade your findings with one another. 

There’s a high probability of water damage to some of your 
equipment, so you buy insurance to avoid losses.

There’s always the chance that someone could make a mistake and 
fall off the cliff. No matter how much you plan for the unexpected, 
sometimes mistakes happen. 

About 10 years ago a really rare bird, the black-throated blue warbler, 
was seen on this cliff. If you could get a picture of it, it would be 
worth a lot of money. So, you bring special seeds that you have read 
are really attractive to this bird, and you set up lookout points around 
the cliff with cameras ready to get the shot.

2. Which of the following is NOT a risk response technique?

A.

Exploit

3. Answer: A

You can exploit opportunities if they come up. 
Even positive risks have risk response techniques.

You use an RBS to figure out and organize your risk categories even before you start to identify them.  Then 
you decompose the categories into individual risks as part of risk identification.

4. Answer: B

Your risk register should include watchlists of low priority risks, and you should review those risks at every 
status meeting to make sure that none of them have occurred.

5. Answer: C

The expected monetary value (or EMV) of the weather risk is the probability (30%) times the cost ($12,000), 
but don’t forget that since it’s a risk, that number should be negative. So its EMV is 30% x -$12,000 = -$3,600. 
The building materials opportunity has an EMV of 20% x $5,000 = $1,000. Add them up and you get -$3,600 + 
$1,000 = -$2,600.

When you’re calculating EMV, negative 
risks give you negative numbers.

Common sense would tell you that 
this is the answer. But brainstorming 
doesn’t have to be anonymous. So, 
it’s got to be Delphi.

Susan bought an insurance policy to cover cost overruns due to weather. She transferred the risk from her 
company to the insurance company.

8. Answer: B

Wow , d i d yo u s e e t h at h u g e re d h e r r i n g ?

You wouldn’t want to transfer an opportunity to someone else! You always want to find a way to use that 
opportunity for the good of the project. That’s why the response strategies for opportunities are all about 
figuring out ways to use the opportunity to improve your project (or another, in the case of sharing).

9. Answer: B

A secondary risk is a risk that could happen because of your response to another risk.

10. Answer: D

Most of the processes of Risk Management are about creating or updating the Risk Register.

The key to this one is to remember that the 
money the project makes is positive, and the 
money it will cost is negative.

11. Answer: B

$200,000 x 0.70 = $140,000 savings, and $100,000 x 0.30 = -$30,000 expenses.  Add them together and 
you get $110,000.

12. Answer: B

Contingency reserves are a way to do risk response planning. You can think of a risk as a “known unknown”—
an uncertain event that you know about, but which may not happen—and you can add contingency reserves to 
your budget in order to handle them. Management reserves are part of Cost Management – you use them to 
build a reserve into your budget for any unknown events that happen.

Risk monitoring and response is so important that you should go through your risk register at every status 
meeting!

14. Answer: D

The probability and impact matrix is a tool that you use to analyze risks. You might find it in your project 
management plan, but it’s not included in the risk register.

15. Answer: A

It’s really important that you get the entire team involved in risk response planning. The more people who look 
for risks, the more likely it is that you’ll find the ones that will actually occur on your project.

16. Answer: D

Even though this looks a little wordy, it’s just another EMV question. The probability of the risk is 50%, and the 
cost is -$650, so multiply the two and you get -$325.

17. Answer: A

This is just the definition of Monte Carlo analysis. That’s where you use a computer simulation to see what 
different random probability and impact values do to your project.

18. Answer: D

project risk management

There are some risks that you just can’t do anything about. When that happens, you have to accept them. But 
at least you can warn your stakeholders about the risk, so nobody is caught off guard.

19. Answer: D

You’ve got an unplanned event that’s happened on your 
project. Is that a risk? No. It’s a project problem, and 
you need to solve that problem. Your probability and 
impact matrix won’t help, because the probability of this 
happening is 100%—it’s already happened. No amount 
of risk planning will prevent or mitigate the risk. And 
there’s no sense in trying to take preventive actions, 
because there’s no way you can prevent it. So the best 
you can do is start looking for a new part supplier.

I see—this wasn’t a risk at all, 
it was just a problem that came 
up during the project. I bet better 
risk planning might have helped the 
team prepare for this!

20. Answer: C

It’s a good idea to bring in someone from outside of your project to 
review your risks. The auditor can make sure that each risk response 
is appropriate and really addresses the root causes of each risk.

Hygiene factors: 
- Compensation [this is D] 
- Company policy & adm inistration [this is E] 
- Working conditions [This is B] 
- Relationship with supervisors and subordinates [this is A] 
- Relationship with peers 
- Level of supervision (too much or to little) [this is can be A] 

Motivating factors: 
- Advancement 
- Achievement

(You should try this problem task wise, i.e. calculate each task separately so: 
Task One     = 5 / (5/6) = 6 
Task Two     = 6 / (4/8) =12 
Task Three  = 4 / (1/1) = 4 
Task Four                     = 4 (LumpSum) 
Total                             = 26 

Then it seems that Budgeted Cost means "the total task budgeted cost at completion"  
while BCWS is for the work scheduled to date, i.e. tasks 2, 3 & 4 not yet completed, only 
# 1 is completed where budgeted cost = BCWP. 

Question Set 7 

Total Questions: 200 

1. Which of the following is not the feature of a project?

2. In an automobile company for which you are the project manager, the allowable 
standard deviation for a product required from the contractor is within 0.002. inches. 
However, while examining the product, you find out that the standard deviation is slightly 
more than 0.002. inches. You believe that the deviation is very small and hence, 
acceptable. In this case you must:

  3         The project is a small project  
  4         Model is Scalable  

 194. Your company has an agreement with the labor union that states that workers will 
not be asked to work more than 45 hours every week. For your project, this becomes a: 

  1         Pre-defined criteria  
  2         Restriction  
  3         Assumption  
  4         Constraint  

195. To manage risks in your project, and communicate with stakeholders, you use several 
reports. Examples of some reports that could be used include all the following EXCEPT: 

  1         Issues Log  
  2         Risk Register  
  3         Action-item logs  
  4         Escalation Notices  

 196. All the following are true about contract negotiation except: 

  1         Primary objective should be to build a lasting relationship  
  2         It includes responsibilities, contract financing, technical and business management 
approaches  
  3         Price is an important consideration during Negotiation  
  4         Main consideration of both buyer and seller should be to maxim ize monetary return   

197. Project Plan includes: 

  1         Subsidiary management plans e.g. Scope Management Plan, Schedule Management 
Plan and Cost Management Plan  
  2         Project Charter, Scope statement and WBS  
  3         Performance Measurement baselines, major m ilestones and target dates  
  4         All the above  

 198. In schedule development, you create a distribution of probable results for each 
activity and use it to calculate distribution of probable results for the total project. The 
technique that you are using is: 

  1         What-if Analysis   
  2         Mathematical Analysis    
  3         Monte Carlo Analysis  
  4         Resource Leveling heuristic  

  199. When all customer requirements for the product of the project are satisfied, 

  1         Customer expectations are exceeded  
  2         Costs may be very high  
  3         Quality criteria are met  
  4         The product will be successful in the market.  

  200. When your objective is to get a lasting win-win solution to a problem, which conflict 
resolution technique should you use?

Total Questions: 141 

1. A particular process has two independent sources of variation. The standard deviation 
of the first source is 3 units and the standard deviation of the second source is 4 units. 
The standard deviation of the processes is: 

A. 3 
B. 4 
C. 5 
D. 7 

The correct answer is C. 
You have to take the Variance to calculate the SD. 
Variance = (S.D) * (S.D) 
S.D = Sqrt of Variance 
Variance of the first source = 3 * 3 = 9 
Variance of the second source = 4 * 4 = 16 
Total Variance = 25 
S.D = Sqrt of variance = 5 

2.  At XYZ Inc., the hourly wage for semi-skilled workers is $14.00. The annual audit shows 
that fringe benefits cost 30% of basic wages, and that overhead costs are 60% of 
wages plus fringe benefits. What is the loaded hourly wage for a semi-skilled worker at 
XYZ Inc.? 
A. $22.40. 
B. $26.60. 
C. $29.12. 
D. $30.33. 

The correct answer is C. 
Fringe Benefits = basic wages * 0.3 = $14 * 0.3 = $4.2 
Overheads = (Basic wages + Fringe benefits) * 0.6  
= (14 + 4.2) * 0.6 = $10.92 
Loaded cost = basic wages + fringe benefits + overheads 
 = 14 + 4.2 + 10.92 = $29.12 
(The confusion is the statement “ overhead costs are 60% of wages plus fringe benefits ” . 
Think of it as 60% of (wages plus fringe benefits), not (60% of wages) plus fringe benefits.) 

3. A fixed-price-plus-incentive-fee (FPI) contract has a target cost of $130,000, a target 
profit of $15,000, a target price of $145,000, a ceiling price of $160,000, and a share 
ratio of 80/20. The actual cost of the project was $150,000. How much profit does the 
seller make?  

A. $10,000  
B. $15,000  
C. $0  
D. $5,000  

The correct answer is A. 

Here is the definition of FPIF (from Federal ARNET): 

Fixed-price incentive (firm target) contracts 
(a) Description. A fixed-price incentive (firm target) contract specifies a target cost, a target 
profit, a price ceiling (but not a profit ceiling or floor), and a profit adjustment formula. These 
elements are all negotiated at the outset. The price ceiling is the maximum that may be paid 
to the contractor, except for any adjustment under other contract clauses. When the 

contractor completes performance, the parties negotiate the final cost, and the final price is 
established by applying the formula.  

b) When the final cost is less than the target cost, application of the formula results in a final 
profit greater than the target profit; conversely, when final cost is more than target cost, 
application of the formula results in a final profit less than the target profit, or even a net loss.  

c) If the final negotiated cost exceeds the price ceiling, the contractor absorbs the difference 
as a loss. Because the profit varies inversely with the cost, this contract type provides a 
positive, calculable profit incentive for the contractor to control costs.  

Hence the only relevant facts are:  

Target Cost (130000 in this case), which triggers the max profit! 
Target Profit (15000 in this case), which the contractor earns when he delivers at exact 
130000. 
Ceiling Price (160000) no matter what the contract value (cost plus incentive) cannot go 
beyond this. 
Share Ratio: 80/20 (Buyer/Seller) and Seller means contractor, here. 

The contractor exceed the cost by = 20,000 
(Target Cost - Actual Cost = $1,30,000 - 1,50,000. = -20,000) 

Since the Sharing Ratio is 80:20, the contractor has to bear 20% of the cost overrun; Seller ’ s 
incentive = 20% * -20,000 = -4000. 

Since the contractor pays $4000, the Target Profit would be 15,000 - 4000 = 11,000. 

The contractor has to get Actual Cost + Profit = $1,50,000 + 11,000 = 1,61,000. Since there 
is a ceiling of 1,60,000, the contractor actually gets paid for only 1,60,000. 

Hence the total Profit would be Net Income – Net expenditure (Cost) 
= 1,60,000 - 1,50,000 = 10,000. 

Hence the answer is A. 

4. The budget for a major project lasting several years is usually prepared to reflect 
expenditures on an annual basis. The budget is, therefore, compared to expenditures 
at the end of each accounting cycle (i.e., each year). This poses a potential problem 
because _________.  

b) 

a) 

the budget will always be greater than the rate of expenditure when delays are 
encountered in paying the billings  
the expenditure rate will be viewed optim istically (under-spent) and the project manager 
will attempt to increase expenditures  
c) the budget is not representative of the expenditure rate when there is an increase to the 
scope of work   
d) the budget changes too frequently to perm it a valid comparison of the plan versus the 
actual expenditures  
e) schedule delays or restructuring of the workload will affect costs during the accounting 
periods and give false indications of expenditure rates  

Answer : ???

1. WBS 
2. project charter 
3. 
the organization strategic plan 
4. message from sponsor 

Answer : 2 (Preferred answer 3 because Project charted is output of scope initiation or You 
need charter to start off scope planning.)

a. Lowest level task to be completed 
b. Collection of the lower level tasks to be completed. 
c. Collection of tasks to be done by one individual or group 
d. All the tasks to be done by one organizational unit. 
e. All of the tasks in the project. 

Answer: C. 
Don't you think answer b or a would be appropriate, since Work Package is the lowest level 
in the WBS.

a. Project 
b. Strong Matrix 
c. Weak Matrix 
d. Project Co-ordinator 
e. project Expeditor 

Answer: e. 
Project Co-ordinator and Project Expeditor are roles of the PM in a functional organization. 
They are not a type of organization. W ouldn't the most appropriate answer be C, 
considering the choices given?

a. Contractors proposal 
b. Bidder's conference 
c. Evaluation Criteria 
d. W eighting System 
e. All of the above. 

Answer: e ????. 
I thought that the answer should be b or a.

I think the answer should be b. 

24. Which of the following is true about the WBS 

a. The WBS is deliverable oriented 
b. Each level represents an increasing level of detail 
c. The WBS is unstructured list of activities in chart form 
d. a and b 
e. none of the above. 

Answer: a 
I thought that answer should be d (a and b) 

25. The project schedule is not used to determine 

a. The starting and finishing dates of the activities 
b. Occasional changes to the activity listing 
c. the total float of the activities 
d. The projects budget 
e. b and d 

Answer: d 
Isn't project schedule an input to Cost Budgeting? 

26. A Gantt chart is useful in determining 

a. The level of effort of a task 
b. W hen a task starts and stops 
c. How tasks are related to each other 
d. W ho is assigned to what task 
e. All of the above. 

Answer: b 
According to PMBOK, Schedule development process, The Bar chart or Gantt chart, shows 
the durations, the starting and the ending date and sometimes the dependencies. So why 
would a and c not be an appropriate answer. 

27. The use of quality management tools is used to provide 

a. Satisfaction 
b. Assurance 
c. Capability 
d. Improvement 
e. Performance 

Answer: b 

28. Project coordination is enhanced through progress reporting, variance reporting, and 
cross-team meetings. These are all forms of:  

A. stakeholder management.  
B. risk management and reporting.  
C. quality management.  
D. communications management. 

The answer is C But I feel it should be D. 
When reporting performance and variance, we do it within the project team as well with 
stakeholders. I would like to consider stakeholder meetings as cross-team meetings to 
support my answer of "D". However, if the cross-team meetings are for non-project related 
teams for lessons' learned, then the activities in the question seem serves quality 
management.  

29. As project manager, which of the following activities most deserves your immediate 
attention? 

A. ACWP = $3,000 and BCWP = $2,900 
B. BCWS = $3,000 and BCWP = $2,900 
C. ACWP = $3,000 and BCWP = $3,200 
D. BCWP = $3,000 and ACWP = $2,400 

Correct Answer: D 

Remember, CV(Cost Variance) = EV(or BCWP) – AC(or ACWP) and SV(Scheduled 
Variance) = EV(or BCWP) – PV(or BCWS) 
So, CV in D is +600 and that of C is +200 and that of A is – 100. Though, negative variance 
in A means BAD, and so apparently PM ’ s attention should have gone to this case, but in 
case of D where the CV is positive (and you think that is good), you have the most 
significant variance, correct answer must be D. Since the question is "which of the following 
activities most deserves your immediate attention" (and it’ s not asking if its good or bad). In 
this case it m ight be a failure planning the cost of the project.  
OR 
CostPerformanceIndex(CPI) 
= 
EarnedValue(EV) 
/ 
SchedulePerformanceIndex(SPI) = EarnedValue(EV) / PlannedValue (PV) 
CPI for A is 0.97, for C is 1.07 and for D is 1.25, while SPI for C is 0.97. This means, for 
every dollar spend on A, C and D, we so far got back $0.97(not bad), $1.07(good) and 
$1.25(Very good – but?) respectively and for D, we completed 97%(not bad) of originally 
planned job. In case of D, the variance is the largest. The fact that it is under budget does 
not mean that the cause of the variance shouldn't be investigated; either the execution is 
incomplete, or the plan was significantly off as a consequence of poor schedule. Either 
case probably requires some corrective action. Hence, a Project Manager ’ s immediate 
attention will go to D.

30. Which of the following is not an input to cost budgeting? 

A. Cost estimates 
B. Work breakdown schedule 
C. Project schedule 
D. Risk management plan 

ANS: D 
Reference: PMBOK 7.3.1 (P. 89)  
I suspect that this is an error and the answer should be B.  
Work Breakdown Structure would have been correct.  

31. Scope verification is a part of 

A. Project initiation 
B. Project planning 
C. Project execution 
D. Project controlling 

ANS: C 
Reference: PMBOK3.3.3 & 5.4 (P. 36)  
I suspect that this is an error and the answer should be D.  

32. Your project will require use of a high-pressure punch press for four months. You can 
rent the press for $10,000 payable at the end of each month You may also choose to 
make a lump sum payment on the day the press is delivered. Using a discount rate 
of 1% per month, the maximum lump sum payment you should choose to make is: 

A. $38,000 
B. $38,500 
C. $39,000 
D. $39,250 

ANS: C  

Present value [PV=FV/(1+i)n] of at the beginning of the first month for all $10,000 paid at 
the end of months for four months, will be $39,019.66 which is just greater than $39,000 (or 
C) – the maximum lump sum amount payable.

33. A work package, scheduled for one year from today, will cost $114,000 at that time. It 
can be done now at a reduced cost. Using a 12% discount rate, the maximum cost 
you should authorize for doing the work now is: 

A. 100,320 
B. 101,750 
C. 102,500 
D. 103,000 

ANS: A ??? 
Present value of $114,000 paid after one year is $101,785.70 and I think answer should be 
B ($101,750).

34. The seller delivers a fixed price plus incentive fee project at a cost of $90,000. The 
terms of the contract are a ceiling price of $120,000, a target cost of $ 100,000, a 
target profit of $10,000, and a target price of $110,000. The share ratio is 70/30. The 
final price (your total reimbursement) is: 

A. $93,000 
B. $96,000 
C. $97,000 
D. None of the above 

The answer is D. 
Actual cost is $90,000, it ’ s less than target cost, so he can retain the target profit ($10,000) 
and also can get 30% incentive from excess profit of $10,000 (= 110,000 –
 90,000 –
10,000), which is $3,000. Hence, the contractor gets Actual Cost + Target Profit + Incentive 
= $90,000 + $10,000 + $3,000 = $103,000 and answer is None of the Above (D). Note: this 
is also less than Ceiling Price ($120,000). 

35. For the following group of numbers: 80, 10, 10, 50, 70 and 90. What is the standard 
deviation? 

A 10 
B 80 
C 35 
D 60 

Correct answer is C (=35). 
SD = Sqrt[Sum{(number - mean)^2}/(n - 1)], where n is sample size. 
Here, mean is (80+10+10+50+70+90)/6 = 51.66 = 52 (say). 
So, SD = Sqrt[{(80-52)^2+(10-52)^2+(10-52)^2+(50-52)^2+(70-52)^2+(90-52)^2}/(6-1)] = 
Sqrt[6083/5] = Sqrt[1217] = 35 

36. In WBS diagramming, the work package is:  
a. Lowest level task to be completed  
b. Collection of the lower level tasks to be completed.  
c. Collection of tasks to be done by one individual or group  

d. All the tasks to be done by one organizational unit.  
e. All of the tasks in the project.  

Answer : C.  
B is probably the closest to correct. The only way I can see C being selected is because 
the W ork Package could be handed off to another group to actually do the work. (Don't you 
think answer b or a would be appropriate since Work Package is the lowest level in the 
WBS.)  

37. A project is considered to be complete when 

a. BCWP, BCWS and EAC are all equal  
b. ACWP, BCWS and EAC are equal  
c. ACWP and EAC are equal  
d. BCWP and EAC are equal.  
e. a and d.  

Answer a.  
When SPI = 1 which means PV and EV are equal, the project is complete. That would 
mean the answer is A. 

38. The earned value report BCWP at the end of the project  

a. = BCWS  
b. = EAC  
c. is always > ACWP  
d. a and b  
e. none of the above.  

Answer - a  
When SPI = 1 which means PV and EV are equal, the project is complete. That would 
mean the answer is A. (Assum ing that the previous answer (BCWP=BCWS=EAC), 
shouldn't the answer be d?)  
b. Strong Matrix  
c. Weak Matrix  
d. Pro 
39. Which of the following organization holds the project manager's authority the weakest  

a. Project  
ject Co-ordinator  
e. project Expeditor  

Answer e.  
In Rita's book, she does talk about Project Expeditor and Project Coordinator as 
Organizations. The Coordinator has more power than the Expediter which would make E 
correct. (Second thought - Project Co-ordinator and Project Expeditor are roles of the PM in 
a functional organization. They are not a type of organization. Wouldn't the most 
appropriate answer be C, considering the choices given?)  

40. Which of the following is or are a part of Solicitation process  

a. Contractors proposal  
b. Bidder's conference  
c. Evaluation Criteria  
d. W eighting System  
e. All of the above.  

Answer : e ????.  
A and B would be the most correct answer. If you consider Solicitation Planning and 
Solicitation as the 'Solicitation' process, then E would be correct. 

41. If the message is very complex, the best method that can be used to have the greatest 
chance for the most complete understanding is  

a. oral  
b. written  
c. nonverbal  
d. a and b  
e. a, b and c  

Answer E. ???? 

I think the answer should be b.  

42. Which of the following is true about the WBS  

a. The WBS is deliverable oriented  
b. Each level represents an increasing level of detail  
c. The WBS is unstructured list of activities in chart form  
d. a and b  
e. none of the above.  

Answer : a ???? 

I thought that answer should be d (a and b)  
A is the right answer as option B is not true because "Each level represents an increasing 
level of detail" does not contain the word descending for level! Refer PMBOK 5.3.3.1. 

43. The project schedule is not used to determine  

a. The starting and finishing dates of the activities  
b. Occasional changes to the activity listing  
c. the total float of the activities  
d. The projects budget  
e. b and d  

Answer : d  

Isn't project schedule an input to Cost Budgeting (another name of Projects Budget?)  

44. A Gantt chart is useful in determining  

a. The level of effort of a task  
b. W hen a task starts and stops  
c. How tasks are related to each other  
d. W ho is assigned to what task  
e. All of the above.  

Answer : b  
Rita says that a Gantt chart in its purest form does not show task interdependencies. That 
would make B correct. (in second thought - According to PMBOK, Schedule development 
process - The Bar chart or Gantt chart, shows the durations, the starting and the ending 

date and sometimes the dependencies. So why would a and c not be an appropriate 
answer.)  

45. The use of quality management tools is used to provide  

a. Satisfaction  
b. Assurance  
c. Capability  
d. Improvement  
e. Performance  

Answer b  
PMBOK says Quality management is required to ensure that the project will satisfy the 
needs for which it was undertaken – so “ Assurance” makes the correct answer.  
Also, the Quality Management tools (Pareto diagram, control charts etc) are primarily tools, 
techniques used in quality control process. The results derived by using these tools are 
inputs to the quality assurance process. Ultimately the usages of these tools are for quality 
improvement and both quality assurance and quality control are part of quality 
management. Therefore the answer 'Assurance' is correct. 

46. Optimistic 3 days, Pessimistic 9 days, and mostly likely 6 days. What is the standard 
deviation of this estimation? 

Method 1: 
PERT simplifies the calculation of Standard Deviation (SD) = [Pessim istic Estimate (TP) – 
Optim istic Estimate (TO)] / 6  
= (9 - 3) / 6 = 1 

Method 2: 
Assume, observations are 3,6,6,6,6,9 (as Optim istic is 3 days, pessim istic is 9 days and 
most likely is 6 days).  
Hence, mean = (3+6+6+6+6+9)/6 = 6; 
SD = Sqrt[Sum{(number - mean)^2}/(n - 1)], where n is sample size. 
= Sqrt[{(3-6)^2+(6-6)^2+(6-6)^2+(6-6)^2+(6-6)^2+(9-6)^2}/(6-1)] = Sqrt[{9+0+0+0+0+9}/5] = 
Sqrt[18/5] = Sqrt[3.6] = 1.9 (WRONG? I don ’ t know why?) 
Correct answer is 1. 

47. Using the data below, the point of total assumption occurs at a cost of work of: 

A. $12,250 
B. $12,750 
C. $13,250 
D. $14,000 

Target Cost: $12,000 
Target Fee: $1,000 
Sharing Ratio: 80%/20% 
Price ceiling: $14,000 

Correct answer is C 

According to Kerzner, the “ point of total assumption” is where the point beyond which the 
seller is responsible for all the additional costs. (You have to consider all the answer one by 
one and find out the right answer) 

If you take the actual cost as 13,250. 

It’ s greater than Target Cost by 12,000 - 13,250 = -1250.  
So, Seller gets incentive of -250 (20% of 1250), actually he has to pay 
His total profit = 1000 - 250 = 850. 
So, final price would be 13,250 + 850 = 14,000, its the price ceiling. 
Hence if he spends more than 13,250 he has to bear the additional cost, since the Buyer 
will pay only 14,000 (ceiling price). 
Hence the answer is C 

OR, do this way: 
If, x is Actual Cost, using Algebraic problem-solving method: we have, 14000 = x + Net 
Profit = x + (Target Profit + Incentive/Loss) 
or, 14000 = x + (1000 + 20% of (12000 – x)) 
or, 14000 = x + 1000 + 2400 – 0.2x = 3400 –
 0.8x 
so, x = (14000 – 3400) / 0.8 = 10600 / 0.8 = 13250 (Answer C) 

48. A process characteristic has a true mean of 150 and a true standard deviation of 20. A 
sample of 25 items is taken from this process. The standard error of the estimate is:  

A. 0.2  
B. 0.8  
C. 4  
D. 5  
E. 7.5 

Correct Answer is C. 

The Standard Error of a statistic is the “ Standard Deviation” of the “ sampling distribution” of 
that statistic. Standard errors are important because they reflect how much sampling 
fluctuation a statistic will show. The standard error of a statistic depends on the sample 
size. In general, the larger the sample size, the smaller the standard error. The standard 
error of a statistic is usually designated by the Greek letter sigma ((cid:1)) with a subscript 
indicating the statistic. For instance, the standard error of the mean is indicated by the 
symbol: (cid:1)M. The formula for the standard error of the mean is: 

where (cid:1) is the standard deviation of the original distribution and N is the sample size (the 
number of scores each mean is based upon). 

So, Standard Error here is 20/sqrt(25) = 20/5 = 4. That is C. 

49. The future value of an annual income flow of $1000 for 2 years at 10% is: 

a) $2310 
b) $2280 
c) $2300 
d) $2200 

Should it not be: $1210? 
No. The answer is A. 
Note that the cash inflow is annual and it seems this annual income is of 2 years of $1000 
each year. 
End of 1st year for $1000 at 10% interest, you will get $1100. 
End of the 2nd year = 1100 + 1000 = 2100 at 10% will be 2310. 
[FV = PV * (1+i)**n = 1000(1.1)+1000(1.1)(1.1) = 1100+1210 = 2310] 

50. A project manager believes that the best way to manage is to form a good, harmonious 
working relationship with the team, and high performance will follow. The project 
manager could be defined as a _____ manager. 

A. 1,9 
B. 9,1 
C. 1,1 
D. 9,9 
E. 5,5 

ANS: A 
Four types of project leader that are considered best suited to different project 
circumstances are, imaginative Explorer (9,9), assertive Driver (9,1), catalyst Coordinator 
(5,5) and Professional Adm inistrator (1,9) – are placed in four quadrants of Focus (X) and 
Approach (Y) axis of General Personality Characteristics Grid. These values of (9,9), (9,1), 
(1,9) and (5,5) are Blake-Mouton Grid descriptions.  
(Refer to http://www.maxwideman.com/papers/profiles/general.htm) 
(1,9) represents Adm inistrator who believes in form ing a good, harmonious working 
relationship with the team. Adm inistrator recognizes the need for stability, typically in order 
to optim ize productivity through maxim izing repetition to the extent possible on a project 
and to get the work finished. Often, requisite information must be assembled and carefully 
analyzed, with thought given to the trade-offs and how conflicts and problems can be 
resolved and disposed of in advance. W ork must be carefully scheduled and procedurized 
if potential gains are to be realized and "all the pieces are to be carefully put in place” . 
So, the answer is A –
 (1,9) the Adm inistrator manager. 

51. You have summarized the project and note that 28,000 hours have been scheduled, 
25,000 hours have been earned and 26,000 hours paid. The correct conclusion is:  

A. The project is operating at a favorable cost efficiency ratio.  
B. the project is spending more than planned  
C. the project is behind schedule  
D. the project is ahead of schedule  
E. B and C  

The answer is C (Isn ’ t it E?) 
Here, EV=25, PV=28 and AC=26; so CV = -1, SV = -3 and CPI = 0.96 and SPI = 0.89. 
Therefore it is over budget and behind schedule; but over-budget by very insignificant point, 
while it is certainly behind schedule by over 10%. That’ s why answer is C. 

52. The LEAST effective form of communication for complex situations is: 

A. verbal - face to face  
B. written  
C. formal  
D. informal  
E. A and C  

ANS: E  
Why would formal communication be least effective? 

53. Electronic Company has a reliability of 0.90. 2 of these components arranged in series 
in a sub-assembly. The reliability for the sub-assembly is: 

a) 0.9 
b) 1.80 

c) 0.81 
d) 0.99 

Answer is C. why??? 
If the connection is in series then multiply the reliability. If the connection is in parallel then 
add the reliabilities. Hence, the answer would be C (= 0.9 x 0.9 = 0.81). 
Theory 
For Serial reliability (events mutually dependents):  
Total = Rt = R1 * R2 = 0.9 * 0.9 = 0.81   
For Parallel Reliability (events independents and redundant):  
Total = Rt = 1 – (1-R1)* (1-R2) = 1 - 0.1 * 0.1 = 0.99. 

54. A particular process has 2 independent sources of variation. The standard deviation of 
the 1st source is 3 units & the standard deviation for the 2nd source is 4 units. The 
standard deviation of the process is: 

a) 3 
b) 4 
c) 5 
d) 7 

Answer is C. why??? 
Standard deviation of the first source is 3 units and the standard deviation for the second 
source is 4 units.  
So, the standard Variance for first source = 9 (= SD^2 = 3 x 3) and Variance for second 
source is 16.  
Total Variance of the combined process = 9 + 16 = 25 
Standard Deviation of the process = sqrt(Variance) = sqrt(25) = 5 
Note: You can only sum up the variances and not Std. deviations. 

55. For the following group of numbers, 80, 10, 10, 50, 70, and 90; what is the mode? 

a) 80 
b) 10 
c) 50 
d) 90 

Don't know the answer or what mode is & how it's calculated! 
The mode is the number with the maximum frequency for discrete data. Since 10's 
frequency is 2 the answer would be 10. 

56. What the following mean in communication:  

Devil's advocate 
Aggressor 
Dom inator 

As par "Team Building for Project managers" by Linn C. Stuckenbruck and Devil Marshall, 
the above roles generally refer to the different "destructive" team roles that one can 
encounter: 
The Aggressor - criticizes and deflates status of others 
The Blocker - rejects the views of others 
The W ithdrawer - holds back and will not participate 
Recognition Seeker - seeks attention by monopolizing discussions 
Topic Jumper - continually changes subject 
Dom inator - tries to take over discussions 

Devil's Advocate - brings up alternative viewpoints (can be positive or very negative). It is 
the position deliberately taken by a member to defend the contrary view (which in most 
cases will be the losing side). The role player defends the cause strongly, so that the 
attitude of the other players to pose arguments and points in favor their cause strengthens. 
In fact this method, will bring out the best of the desired view and seal the case in its favor. 
Devil's advocate knows this and finally concedes defeat. 

57. The practice of ceasing mass inspections and ending awards based on price is 
credited to: 

A. Edward Dem ing  
B. Philip Crosby  
C. Juran  
D. Pareto  

Answer: A  
Refer http://courses.bus.ualberta.ca/orga432-reshef/dem ing.htm 

58. In negotiating with functional managers, project managers often find themselves using 
what two-party conflict management approach:  

A. W in-Lose  
B. W in-W in  
C. Lose-Lose  

Answer: C, As both of them has to give in a little 

59. Deflection or transfer of risk to another party is part of which of the following risk 
response:  

A. Mitigation  
B. Acceptance  
C. Avoidance  
D. Analysis  

Answer: A 
Because Mitigation is - Taking steps to lessen risk by lowering the probability of a risk 
event's occurrence or reducing its effect should it occur. (Actual answer is Transference. 
This is not given in the given choices. Please refer PMBOK Chapter 11, Page: 142.) 

60. A Fixed Price plus Incentive fee (FPI) contract has a target cost of $1,30,000, a target 
profit of $15,000, a target price of $1,45,000, a ceiling price of $160,000, and share 
ration of 80/20. The actual cost of the project was $150,000. How much profit does 
the seller make?  

A. 10,000  
B. 15,000  
C. 0  
D. 5000  

Answer: A 
Profit/Loss amount = Target Cost – Actual Cost = 130000 – 150000 = -20000. Incentive 
Amount = 20% of (-20000) = -4000. Profit Amount = Target Profit + Incentive Amount = 
15000 – 4000 = 11000. 
Total price = Actual Cost + Profit Amount = 150000 + 11000 = 161000 

But there is a ceiling, so modified Total Price is 160000. 
So the Seller gets only 10000 (=160000 – 150000).  
Hence answer is A. 

61. Which type of bilateral contract is used for high dollar, standard items? 

A. PO (Purchase Order) 
B. RFP (Request for Proposal) 
C. IFB (Invitation for Bid) 
D. RFQ (Request for Quotation) 

Answer: C 

62. There is a project with CPI = 0.81 and TCPI = 1.00001; this project is: 

1. Over budget and cannot recover  
2. Under budget  
3. Over budget and early in its evolution  
4. No inferences can be made.  

Answer: 3 (Not quite sure!) 
CPI less than 1.0 tells us that we are Over-budget.  
The To-Complete-Performance-Index (TCPI) calculates an efficiency factor, which must be 
attained, if the remaining works to be completed within the forecasted EAC. So, TCPI of 
1.00001 means it looks achievable.  
That means, this project is Over-Budgeted but can be recovered – Answer C is closest of 
all. 

63. You work as a senior project manager for a leading manufacturer of tennis racquets. 
Management wants to explore new markets and new products to boost revenue and 
profits. You are leading a team to identify potential products. Because of your 
background in exercise science you have you recommended developing a new type 
of tennis ball. But when you submitted the idea for review, executive management 
informed you that this product would not fit the organization's core competences. 
You need to go back to the drawing board ad recommend other products using 
management's guidelines as: 

A) An Assumption 
B) A constraint 
C) A specification 
D) A technical requirement 

Answer: A (I chose B....) 
As far as this Question is concerned, a lot of us would opt for Choice B. However, my 
thoughts are as follows. Going by PMBOK's definition on Ch. 4 - Pg. 40, the restriction of 
having to work within the core competencies of the organization is not going to lim it the 
performance of the project. Also, this restriction is going to apply to an input of the 
"Initiation" stage, i.e. the product description. So, it maybe safe to treat this an assumption. 
If we treat this as an assumption, it is a factor that is valid for all planning purposes. It has 
an impact on the project. It maybe that core competency gets progressively elaborated 
(detailed) during the course of the project.  

64. In which of the following scope management processes is the scope management plan 
prepared? 

a) Initiation 

b) Scope Planning 
c) Scope definition 
d) Scope Change Control 

Answer: A (I naturally choose B but...) 
Your answer choice B is positively correct. Please see PMBOK 2000 –
guess there was an error in the answer choice.

65. What is the purpose of dummy actvity in an activityon-arrow diagram? 

(A) Show task that are not necessary 
(B) Show tasks that are alternatives to planned tasks 
(C) Show task dependency 
(D) Show task that is completed 

Answer: D (My answer has been C but...) 

66. A process characteristic has a true (population) mean of 150 & a true (population) Std 
Deviation of 20. A sample of 25 items is taken from this process. The Std Deviation 
for the sample is :- 

A. 0.2 
B. 0.8 
C. 4.0 
D. 5.0 

Answer: C 
In a normal distribution the variance is calculated as follow: 
X (mean) = (a1+a2+a3+....+an)/n 
V (variance) = sum( (X-an)^2 )/n-1 (divided by n if small sample) 
S (standard deviation) = sqrt(V) 
From the question: 
X = (0.2 + 0.8 + 4 + 5) / 4 = 2.5 
V = (2.5 - 0.2)^2 + (2.5 - 0.8)^2 + (2.5 - 4)^2 + (2.5 - 5)^2 = 5.29 + 2.89 + 2.25 + 6.25 = 
16.68 
S = sqrt(V) = 4.08411 = 4.0. So, the answer is C. 
or, 
StdDev of Sample = StdDev of Population / sqrt of samplpe size 
StdDev of Sample = 20/(sqrt of 25) 
StdDev of Sample = 4 

67. A particular Process produces parts with Standard Deviation = 6 unit. Every 3 hrs, a 
sample of 4 items is taken & its mean is plotted. The Standard Deviation of the mean 
is  

A : 2 
B : 3 
C : 4 
D : 5 

Answer: B 
You could calculate, the SD of the sample as SD of population / sqrt(sample size) = 6 / 
sqrt(4) = 6/2 = 3. So answer is (B). 
When the question says std dev of mean, i assume that is just a typo either for "std dev of 
the sample" or "std dev from the mean" 

68. A process has Critical path of 12 days & Standard Deviation of 1. What is the 
probability that the process will be completed in 13 days. 

A : 10% 
B : 68% 
C : 84% 
D : 95% 

Answer: C (As the target date is 1 SD away, I will select 68%. Why 84%?) 
The probability of PERT estimates is 50% and it is the mean. 
1 SD from the mean covers an additional population of 34.1%, 2 SD from the mean covers 
47.7% and 3 SD covers 49.8%. Conversely, -1 SD from the mean covers a population of -
34.1% etc. 
13 days means - 1 additional day from the mean (that is 1 SD too); so from the data above 
the cumulative probability to complete, comes from 50% + 34.1% = 84.1% (answer C) 
To better understand my affirmation, we should consider a PERT estimate as a mean of a 
normal distribution (although PERT is based on a beta distribution but we all know that all 
the distribution can be approximated by a normal distribution), thus the area under the 
Gaussian curve delim ited by the mean is 50% of the entire area. 

69. I'm hopelessly confused: per Rita Mulcahy, pg 138, the most often asked for formula for EAC 
is EAC=BAC/CPI, used when there are no variances from BAC, or when you expect to 
continue at same rate. She uses it for the exercise on pg 141, which definitely has a 
variance. Neither the PMBOK nor Heldman mention this formula, and recommend using 
EAC=AC+(BAC-EV)/CPI when you expect variances to continue. Please help me 
understand - and for those who recently passed: which formula did you use if the question 
didn't specifically identify if variances are expected to continue. Thank you in advance; this 
forum is exceptionally helpful. 

Answer:  
Actually, even though the formulas have a different meaning based on the context, 
mathematically they are the same: 
EAC = BAC / CPI with no variance 
EAC = AC + ( BAC - EV ) / CPI with variance, based on performance 
But, CPI = EV / AC, so  
EAC = AC + ( BAC - EV ) / CPI 
    = AC + BAC / CPI  - EV / CPI 
    = AC + BAC / CPI - EV / ( EV / AC ) 
    = AC + BAC / CPI - EV * ( AC / EV ) 
    = AC + BAC / CPI - AC 
    = BAC / CPI 
Why does this work? When there is no variance, the CPI should be 1, and the EAC should 
be the BAC. 

70. Using the PERT, the probability of completing a project at or later than its expected 
time is: 

a. 0% 
b. 50% 
c. 68% 
d. 95% 

Answer is b. Why? 
Because PERT is based on Normal Distribution, which is centered around mean. Though, 
PERT is actually based on a BETA distribution but from the law of huge numbers, every 
distribution can be approximated by a normal distribution. 

71. A company is making a decision regarding which model of equipment to buy for its 
next project. The equipment has a life of 4 years. Model E will have a cost of owning 
of $ 600 a month. The following info is available for model G. Purchase price is $ 
20000. Operational cost is $1000 per year. Mean time between failures is 10 months. 
Damage per failure is $550 dollars. Which of the following is true? 

a. The monthly cost of owning Model G is approximately $550 
b. The monthly cost of owning Model G is approximately $670 
c. The monthly cost of owning Model G is more than the monthly cost of owning model E 
d. Not determ inable from the above info.  

Answer is a. How? 
Model E: Total cost = 600*4*12 = 28800. PM cost = 28800/48 = 600. 
Model G: Total Cost = 20000 + 1000*4 + 550*48/10 = 26640.  
PM Cost = 26640/48 = 555, i.e., approximately $550. Answer is A. 

72. Can anyone pinpoint the exact difference between Program vis- à -vis Project Portfolio - 
as per PMI/PMBOK? 

The short answer is that portfolio is not defined in the 2002 Edition of the PMBOK Guide, 
and a program is a group of related projects that benefit from being managed in a 
coordinated way. And project is a temporary endeavor undertaken to create a unique 
product, service, or result.  
I think the key word is related. Think of the Boeing 777 program as a group of related 
projects (electrical systems development, mechanical systems development, etc.). All are 
related to each other and none can be cancelled without harm to the 777-development 
program. 
A group of completely unrelated projects could be managed as a portfolio with the option 
of canceling one of the projects and freeing up resources without negatively affecting the 
other projects in the portfolio. 

73. Assuming a PERT weighted average computation, what is the probability of completing 
the project within plus-or-minus 3 standard deviations of the mean? 

A. 68%  
B. 99.74%  
C. 95%  
D. 75%  

Answer: B  
(Refer to Q.68 above) Probability = Mean + 3 SD = 50% + 49.8% 

74. A quality control (QC) manager for a manufacturing firm is calculating the expected 
standard deviation (s) for the length of hex bolts being produced on the assembly 
line. There are two sources of variation in the length of the hex bolts: production 
variation and measurement error. The QC manager knows that the standard 
deviations from these two sources are 0.24 inch and 0.43 inch, respectively. 
Assuming that there are no other significant sources of error, what answer should 
the QC manager calculate for the total standard deviation of the length of the hex 
bolts?  

A. 0.10 inch  
B. 0.19 inch  
C. 0.34 inch  
D. 0.49 inch  

E. 0.67 inch  

Answer = D 
When you add SD, first take Variance, add up and then take Sq root.  
Thus New SD = Sqrt(0.24*0.24 + 0.43*0.43) = Sqrt(0.2425) = 0.49 

75. The man-hours for project integration activities normally appear at which WBS level? 

A. 1 
B. 2 
C. W ork Package 
D. Level of Effort 

The answer is B 
As I understood from referring most materials, the 1st of WBS is the Project or the program 
as a whole. The last level of WBS (usually the 4th) is the work package level. Irrespective 
of what is there in which level, the cost of integration will definitely be greater in the Work 
Package level than the cost of integrating the higher level components. As the level of 
decomposition increases, the costs of integrating each of the pieces will definitely increase. 
At least this is how I understood. 

76. Define the following Risk types: 

Favorable Risk 
Opportunity Risk 
Pure Risk 
Business Risk 

Business Risk: Positive or Negative Risk, which you need to take for doing business. Like 
you may have the risk of loosing your investment money but also has the positive risk of 
getting profit.  
Pure Risk: This is only negative risk, which can be insurable. And without insurance it is 
very difficult to plan any suitable response strategy for this risk, like Fire, Flood, Accident, 
etc. 
Opportunity Risk: The risk that a better opportunity will present itself after an irreversible 
decision had been made. 
Favorable Risk: ??? 
[Favorable Risk and Opportunity Risk I am not sure but isn't it obvious from the words 
"Opportunity" and "Favorable"] 

77. Define the following Damage types: 

Compensatory Damages 
Punitive Damages 
Liquidated Damages 
Consequential Damages 

Compensatory Damages: damages intended to compensate the injured party for his or her 
loss. If you lose money because someone doesn't keep his or her prom ise to you, the court 
makes that person pay you for your loss. 
Punitive Damages: damages intended to punish the wrongdoer. In general, punitive 
damages are awarded when the wrongdoer violates the law, as opposed to breaking a 
prom ise. Punitive damages would not be awarded for a breach of contract. 
Liquidated Damages: damages where the amount is specified in the contract, e.g. if the 
contract includes a clause that says if you don't deliver on time, you will pay $50,000, those 
are liquidated damages. 

Consequential Damages: damages, which are a consequence of your actions, rather than 
a direct result of your actions. For example, if I buy a faucet and it's leaky, compensatory 
damages would replace my faucet, and consequential damages would replace my carpet, 
which was ruined when the house was flooded. Consequential damages can far exceed the 
cost of a contract. 

78. Scope verification is a part of: 

A. Project initiation 
B. Project planning 
C. Project execution 
D. Project controlling 

Answer in the source is: C (Reference: PMBOK 3.3.3 & 5.4) 

But I think the answer should be 'D' (Ref. PMBOK 3.3.4).  
In the PMBOK 2000 version if you look on page ix, "Preface to the 2000 Edition" bullet 
number 8 states "We moved scope verification from an executing process to a controlling 
process." so depending on which version of the PMBOK the question is based on the 
answer will differ. 

79. Define with examples of attribute sampling and variable sampling. 

Attribute Sampling: This is a Pass/Fail QC method. For example, if you were making 
something critical (pace makers, parachutes, rocket components) where any deviation from 
perfection is considered unacceptable, then you are doing attribute sampling.  

Variable Sampling: You are testing within an acceptable range of deviation. For example, 
you are filling cereal boxes. The package may say 975g. The tolerance could be +/- 7g, so 
a box filled to 968g - 982g is OK, any box outside this range would be unacceptable. 

Both of these are sampling. So, not every unit would be checked but rather a selected 
number (eg. 3 out of every 100) and would be used to represent an entire lot or batch. The 
tolerance for risk, cost of checking, expert judgment, etc. would dictate the sampling rate. 

80. In which process would you be most likely use variable [or attribute, for that matter] 
sampling? 

A. Quality planning 
B. Quality assurance 
C. Quality control 
D. Qualitative risk analysis 

The answer would be C, quality control. 

Variable (sometimes variables) sampling involves products or processes that are measured 
over a range (or variety) of numbers. For example, the percentage of salt content on potato 
chips, the depth of concrete for a new highway, the size of the gap between a car door and 
body for car manufacturers or the length of time it takes a page to load on a web site.  

Usually, as in the first three cases, the goal is to hit a target. In other words: (still talking 
variable sampling) the potato chip maker wants a target amount of salt on the chip, say 2%. 
More is bad (for health purposes) and less is bad (for taste purposes). If the depth of 
highway concrete is supposed to be 11 inches, more is bad (waste) and less is bad (early 
deterioration). In the case of the web site page loading, shorter is better, but we still 

measure the results over a range of possibilities, say from 1 to 30 seconds, so our 
sampling procedure will use variable sampling. 

Variable Sampling Examples (actual increments will vary) 
Chips: 1.8%, 1.9%, 2.0%, 2.1%, and 2.2% 
Concrete: 10.0", 10.5", 11.0", 11.5", and 12.0" 
Web page loading: 1 sec, 2 sec, 3 sec, etc. 

Attribute sampling involves a yes/no or binary decision. The product has the characteristic 
(usually a defect) or it doesn't. Attribute sampling is often done in batches of 50. For 
example, taking 50 bolts off the assembly line to check for defective threads. Or exam ine 
50 out of a thousand lines of code at random to check for m istakes. When the product or 
service is exam ined, it will either exhibit the attribute being investigated or not. For 
example, it either has a m istake or doesn't have a m istake.  

Dr. Dem ing's Red Bead Experiment was an example of attribute sampling. Volunteers from 
the workshop would dip a paddle with 50 depressions into a bunch of red and white beads. 
White beads were good, red beads represented defects. 

The results of these two types of sampling are usually plotted on a control chart. Control 
charts are also only used in 8.3 Quality Control, according to PMI. To summarize, I'll write a 
couple more sample questions. 

81. As part of your project team's quality control procedures, you have decided to 
measure the length of time it takes for your team to respond to participants who 
have questions concerning a pilot version of your new product. Because you 
anticipate hundreds of inquiries, you may decide to use what approach to measure 
the results? 

A. Benchmarking 
B. Costs of quality 
C. Attribute sampling 
D. Variable sampling 

Since the question focuses on the length of time, the answer is D, variable sampling. The 
results may vary from .1 hour to 48 hours and could be plotted as a range (or distribution) 
on a histogram. On the other hand, if the team simply wanted to know if pilot participants 
liked the product or not, it would be possible to use attribute sampling. 

82. Your project team has created a new way to process claim forms. You want to know 
the percentage of claims that are now being paid within 10 days. To measure the 
number of claims that meet the 10-day goal vs. those that don't, which of these 
quality control techniques would you use? 

A. Variable sampling 
B. Attribute sampling 
C. Flowcharting 
D. Pareto diagrams 

The way the question is worded, the answer is B - attribute sampling. In this situation you 
would track whether each case met the deadline or it didn't. However, in practice you may 
actually want to track the number of days it took to resolve each claim on a variable scale 
of 1 to 100 days, then look at how many were done in 10 days or less. In this case you 
would be using variable data. 

By the way, variable data and attribute data are plotted on different types of control charts. 

For the exam, be able to recognize... 
1) Data examples as either variable (range) or attribute (does or does not have the 
attribute.) 
2) The fact the sampling is part of the Quality Control process. 

83. Define and sequence following different stages of the Team Development: 

1. Formation 
2. Storm ing 
3. Norm ing 
4. Perform ing. 

The order is Form ing --> Storm ing --> Norm ing --> Perform ing. 
The 4 stages of team development is called "Tuckman" model. The name is from Bruce 
Tuckman who wrote about this model in 1965. 

Form ing: also called floundering - this is the awkward time when a team just comes 
together and everyone is getting to know each other and each others role(s) on the project. 
It’ s time for getting acquainted. 

Storm ing: also called conflict - at this stage teams begin to confront issues and other team 
members. Conflict over goals, priorities, roles - can cause tension and disagreement. It’ s 
time of competitive tension. 

Norm ing: also called organized - team is now demonstrating cohesiveness and cooperation 
to meet project objectives. At this stage, teams are better able to handle roadblocks 
because procedures are established and skills have been developed. It ’ s time for 
developing procedures and policies. 

Perform ing: also called productive - team is perform ing at a high level and there is mutual 
trust among the team members. Roles and procedures are accepted, understood and 
followed. It ’ s now the effective team.  

84. You are establishing a PMO for National Animal Celebrity Management program, which 
consists of 15 separate projects. The PMO will have a Project Management 
Information System. This system will be an on-line repository of all program data. 
You will collect descriptions of all work components for each of the 15 projects. This 
information will form an integral part of the: 

A. Chart of Accounts 
B. WBS Dictionary 
C. WBS Structure template 
D. Earned Value Mgmt Reports 

Answer is B, but why not C? 
We can elim inate A and D right away for obvious reason. For C - WBS structure template? 
Not likely. We do not know the nature of 15 projects, are they all in certain 
category/type/industry? So template is not likely. B is the only one left. And yet I have not 
check the real meaning of WBS Dictionary according to PMBOK. 
[Then if you jump Chapter 5 in page 61 and read the definition of WBS Dictionary, you will 
get the same answer.] 

85. All of the following are true regarding configuration management except: 

a. Requires all acceptance decisions to be made through the CCB 

b. Serves as a Change control system 
c. Describes the physical characteristics of the product of the project 
d. Control changes to the characteristics of an item 

I feel the correct answer is c. Please, let me know if I am correct. 
I believe the correct answer is A. Configuration Management is a broad discipline used to 
track and manage changes to, well, everything. In the context of Project Management, it is 
used to track and manage any changes to the official documents of the project, including 
requirements.  

The PMBOK specifically defines the CCB, the Change Control Board, as being a group of 
stakeholders with responsibility for approving changes to the Project Baseline. This is more 
specific than "all acceptance decisions". Changes, which are not changes to the baseline, 
can be tracked through CM, without requiring approval by the CCB. 

However, to split hairs, there is certain confusion in saying that Configuration Management 
describes the physical characteristics of the product of the project. Requirements 
documents describe those characteristics, CM is used to control changes to those 
requirements. 

86. All of the following are true regarding the Ishiwaka diagram in the quality planning 
process except: 

a. They are also called as cause-effect diagram 
b. They are also called as fish Bone diagram 
c. They are the tools and techniques 
d. They are an output of this process. 

Answer is d. 
I agree with the answer. But I feel that the questions should be relating to Quality Control 
rather than Quality Planning. Because we don't use Fish bone diagram during the Quality 
planning process. Please let me know your comments on this. 
The PMBOK specifically mentions Ishikawa diagrams as part of the quality planning 
process. I've never used them personally. From what I've read about them, they are a tool 
for organizing and visualizing causes of quality issues, used for brainstorm ing sessions and 
the like. As such, they would be a planning tool, rather than a quality control tool. Quality 
control analyzes specific quality issues to find and correct the root cause. 

Here's a good link: http://mot.vuse.vanderbilt.edu/mt322/Ishikawa.htm  

In terms of nomenclature, PMBOK's approach to quality seems to be: 
Quality Planning = develop quality management plan, design development processes to 
maxim ize quality 
Quality Assurance = use the quality management plan during project execution 
Quality Control = measure quality and respond to specific quality issues, including rework 
and updates to development processes 

87. Each of the following describes an element of the scope definition process except: 

a. Breaking down the major deliverables of the project into smaller, manageable 
components 
b. Supporting details 
c. Decomposition 
d. Improving the accuracy of time and Cost Estimates 

The correct answer is c.  

I agree that we don ’ t have "supporting detail" as part of input/tool and techniques and 
output. Can any one help me to understand how does the scope definition process helps in 
improving the accuracy of time and Cost Estimates. It is because the output of the scope 
definition is WBS, which provides the schedule dates and cost budget. How does this 
works? 
A and C are gimmes. Scope definition involves creating the WBS, which is decomposition 
of the project deliverables. The other two, ugh. There is no mention of supporting details, 
but there is mention of other planning outputs. Scope Planning, for example, has 
supporting detail as an output. There is no doubt that scope definition results improved 
accuracy of time and cost estimates; but this is not an element of the scope definition 
process, this is a result of the process that occurs later on in other processes. If I didn't 
think about it, I would pick B. On careful reflection, with the book in front of me, I would pick 
D. My guess is we're putting a lot more thought into this question than the author did. 

88. You have a choice of accepting a fixed price contract for $115,000 with a liquidated 
damages clause or $100,000 without the clause. There is a 60% chance your cost will 
be $90,000 and 40% chance your cost will be $80,000. There is a 98% chance of 
meeting your schedule but the penalty if missed is $50,000. Which is the best 
contract choice and how much profit would you make? 

A. Contract without the clause; profit is $14,000 
B. Contract without the clause; profit is $27,980 
C. Contract with the clause; profit is $14,000 
D. None of the above 

Answer: D 
A liquidated damages clause is a clause in the contract that specifies a dollar amount to be 
paid if some provision of the contract is not met. It is a way of contractually setting the 
damages for some failure to perform.  
The answer to the problem is (from a previous post): 
You get the expected value multiplying an outcome by the probability of it occurring, and 
adding up these products for all outcomes. 
For the contract without the clause, you get paid $100,000. One outcome is that you will 
spend $90,000. Your profit will be $10,000. There is a 60% chance of this outcome 
occurring, so you get $10,000*0.6=$6,000. The other outcome is that you will spend 
$80,000. Your profit will be $20,000. There is a 40% chance of this outcome occurring, so 
you get $20,000*0.4=$8,000. If you add these two up, you get$14,000. If you decide to take 
the $100,000 contract, your "average" profit will be $14,000. 
For the contract with the clause, you get paid $115,000. If you will spend $90,000, your 
profit will be $25,000. There is a 60% chance of this outcome occurring, so you get 
$25,000*0.6=$15,000. If you spend $80,000, your profit will be $35,000. There is a 40% 
chance of this outcome occurring, so you get $35,000*0.4=$14,000. Since the problem 
doesn't say otherwise, assume that no matter how much you spend, there is a 2% of 
m issing the schedule. If you do, you pay $50,000. $50,000*0.02=$1,000. You will subtract 
this amount from the total, since this money would come out of your profit. If you add these 
all up, you get $15,000+$14,000-$1,000=$28,000. If you decide to take the $115,000 
contract with the liquidated damages clause, your "average" profit will be $28,000. 
Correct answer is contract with clause, expected profit $28,000. 

89. Some times, I get confused on the problems relating IRR and payback period. If I have 
a Problem, which talks about the cash inflow, pay back period and IRR. Which one 
should I consider as first criteria while choosing the best project between the two 
projects? 

IRR, Internal Rate of Return, implies a positive cash flow, i.e. and IRR of 10% means you 
are getting $1.10 for every dollar invested in the project.  This is like saying the Benefit to 

Cost Ratio (BCR) is 1.1.  A payback period implies that the project is losing money, until the 
payback period is ended.  In the absence of any other information, I would pick a project 
with a positive cash flow, a positive IRR, or a BCR > 1, over a project with any payback 
period.  If you had more information, you would want to figure out or know the current value 
of the project over the life of the “ product” .  This is Net Present Value; the project with the 
largest NPV wins. 

On the other hand, a project with a payback period will eventually break even.  A project 
with a negative IRR, a BCR < 1.0, or a negative NPV, will always lose money.  In this case 
the project with the payback period wins. 

90. What do you understand of the different kinds of the Risk managers? 

Risk-m itigation Manager 
Risk-Averse Manager 
Risk-Seeking Manager 
Risk-Neutral Manager 

The attitude of a person towards risk is revealed by his or her utility function. The utility 
function is a graph with X-axis representing the amount of “ money” a person has (for 
investment, say) and the Y-axis representing "utility" or how much that money is worth to 
us. 
A convex curve (increasing slowly initially and then faster) indicates a "risk seeker". It 
indicates that as the payoff in question gets larger, the utility of it increases much more 
quickly for you. So you are willing to take more risks to make more money.  
A concave curve (increasing quick initially then flattening out) indicates a "risk averse" 
person. This indicates that money is initially valuable, but once you already have a lot of 
money, you will be less inclined to risk it all for more money.  
A straight 45-degree line indicates a "risk neutral" person. For such a person, every dollar 
is worth as much as the other.  
In answer to your question, for a risk-averse person, utility is decreasing as he will be less 
inclined to bet his money on a venture where the expected value is not fully known. 

I have not heard of anyone being called a "risk m itigation" manager. Risk m itigation is a risk 
response. It should not affect your attitude to risk. 

91. You plan to issue a purchase order (PO) to a supplier to provide services to the 
project. The contract is in place when: 

a) Both offer and acceptance has occurred 
b) It has been received by the buyer 
c) It is signed by both seller and buyer 
d) It is issued by the project procurement section 

Answer is (a). I thought it is (d) as Purchase Order is a Unilateral arrangement.  

A is the correct answer.  A purchase order is unilateral only in the sense that one party sets 
all of the terms of the contract; the party that issues the PO is saying, "If you send me these 
goods or provide these services, I agree to pay you this much".  The other party accepts 
the contract by sending the goods or providing the services.  If the party does not send the 
goods or provide the services, there is no contract. On the other hand, if the party who 
receives the PO and does provide the goods or services, it is implicit acceptance of all of 
the terms and conditions of the PO. 

B is not correct because the buyer typically issues the purchase order to the seller.  Even if 
the seller receives the purchase order, there is no contract until the seller accepts, i.e. sells 

the goods or services to the buyer.  There is one exception to this: if the seller previously 
provided a quote for the goods and services, this constitutes an offer.  If the PO is issued 
with identical terms and conditions against the quote, this constitutes an acceptance of the 
offer, and a contract is in place (NOTE:if this happens, A is still the correct answer, there 
has been an offer and an acceptance of the offer).  If any of the T&C's are different, it is a 
counter offer and a contract is not in place until the seller accepts the offer by providing the 
goods or services. 

C is not true because a purchase order is signed by just one of the parties. 

D is not true for the same reasons as B, with the additional reason that the seller has not 
yet received the PO.  So even if the seller provided a quote and a PO was issued, if it was 
never delivered to the seller, no contract is in place. 

92. Measuring the probability and consequences of risks is part of: 

A. Risk management planning 
B. Risk identification 
C. Qualitative risk analysis 
D. Quantitative risk analysis 

Answer: A. (I feel the answer should be C. Any thoughts?) 
Notice, the key word in the first question is "Measuring".  This would imply D - quantitative 
risk analysis. It would not be A, because Risk Management Planning deals with your 
general approach to managing risk, not with specific risks. Risk Identification doesn't 
involve any estimation of the probability of a risk or the impact. Qualitative Analysis involves 
a broad determ ination of the probability and impact of risks, but I would argue that there is 
no "measurement" done in qualitative analysis. 

93. When there is uncertainty associated with one or more aspects of the project, one of 
the first steps to take is to: 

a. Revise project plan 
b. Conduct a risk-benefit analysis 
c. Conduct a needs analysis 
d. Increase the estimated cost of the project 

I would pick B - conduct a risk benefit analysis, because the first thing you want to do is 
understand the nature of the risk. How you respond this analysis may result in any of the 
other three actions. 

94. One of the engineers on your team performs a presentation to a perspective client 
about a proposed design. In answering questions, the engineer reveals that she 
does not agree with the way in which this system is engineered during the 
presentation. What are your options as the project manager of the engineer, listening 
to the presentation? 

a) Immediately stop the engineer and do damage control 
b) Ask the engineer to explain the discrepancy and what recommendations she can offer  
c) Communicate an openness to the problem and lead a discussion to resolve the issues 
d) Rephrase the problem to ensure that everyone understands the various major points and 
solicit input from everyone 

A would be my first response. Presumably, any design issues will be hashed out before this 
presentation is made. As the PM, you should know why the design choices were made and 
should be able to answer the engineer's concerns directly to the client as part of your 
damage control. If there are pending design issues, these should be noted in the 
presentation, and the engineer's comments can be placed in the context of these noted 
issues. 
B puts the loose cannon engineer in the driver's seat, and solicits design decisions from the 
client. I am assum ing that the client is using the project team for it's expertise, and as such 
should not be involved in these decisions. 
C again involves the client in the design process. 
D allows the PM to regain control of the meeting, and allows the client to respond to the 
issue so they don't think anything is being swept under the rug, but the PM is not making 
any comm itment to any particular course of action. This would be my second choice, and I 
would do this if the client pressed the issue. Still, by airing the issue in front of the client, 
you will increase the client's angst about the project. 

The PM needs to provide immediate feedback to the engineer after the meeting in a 
situation like this. When a client is depending on the expertise of the project team, it is 
imperative that the team provides a uniform face to the client, and that all conflict is 
resolved internally instead of in front of the client. Open conflict in front of the client will 
underm ine the client's confidence in the project team and jeopardize the project. If the 
engineer has issues with the design, those should be discussed openly at internal project 
meetings, and resolution should be reached internally, and then everybody should abide by 
the resolution. 

95. When components in a system are arranged in parallel, system reliability be: 

a. Better than the best component 
b. As good as the best component 
c. As good as the weakest component 
d. The product of the reliability of individual components 

Answer is b. (No, correct answer will be A) 

Regarding parallel and serial reliability: for components arranged in parallel, the reliability is 
better than the best component and for components arranged in serial, the reliability of the 
system is worse than the worst component. When components are arranged in parallel, 
only one of the units need to be successful for the whole system to be a success (i.e. the 
system fails only when every unit fails). There is redundancy built into the system. In a 
series arrangement, the failure of any one of the components leads to the failure of the 
whole system. 

Here is an example:  
Suppose two components with reliability 0.3 and 0.6 are arranged in parallel; then the 
reliability of the system is given by: 
R = 1 - [(1-R1)(1-R2)] = 1 - (0.7)(0.4) = 0.72, which is better than both 0.7 and 0.4. 
If two components with reliability 0.3 and 0.6 are arranged in series, then the reliability of 
the system is given by: 
R = R1 * R2 = 0.3 * 0.6 = 0.18, which is lower than both 0.3 and 0.6. 
Also, a parallel configuration (because of its redundancy) gives you a higher reliability (.72) 
than a sim ilar serial configuration (.18). 
[Another way to look into this is:  
If, 1stS -> 1st being successful, 1stF -> 1st being unsuccessful, and 2ndS -> 2nd being 
successful, 2ndF -> 2nd being unsuccessful, then 
Probability of 1stS + 2ndS = 0.3 * 0.6 = 0.18 
Probability of 1stS + 2ndF = 0.3 * 0.4 = 0.12 

Probability of 1stF + 2ndS = 0.7 * 0.6 = 0.42 
Probability of 1stF + 2ndF = 0.7 * 0.4 = 0.28 
So, when they are in parallel, Probability of success = Probability of at least one being 
successful = 0.18 + 0.12 + 0.42 = 0.72 
And, when they are in series, Probability of success = probability of both being successful = 
0.18] 

So, the answer to this question is (a). 

96. When components in a system are arranged in series, system reliability be:  

a. Better than the best component 
b. As good as the weakest component 
c. Lower than the weakest component 
d. The sum of the reliability of individual components 

Answer is c (True, please refer to the logic of item 96 above) 

97. An electronic component had a reliability of 0.90. Two of these components are 
arranged in series in a sub-assembly. The system reliability for the sub-assembly is: 

a. 0.90 
b. 1.80 
c. 0.81 
d. 0.99. 

Answer is c 
As they are in series, System reliability = 0.9 * 0.9 = 0.81. (Refer to item 96 above) 

98. The project Manager determines that 100% inspection is required for the product. The 
best statement to describe this approach is: 

A. This is best proven method to ensure quality  
B. No defect will go undetected  
C. This is an expensive ineffective approach to quality Management.  
D. Sorting out the good items from the bad 

Answer: C 
A is not right because 100% inspection is not the best proven method to ensure quality. B 
is not true because an inspection is not always guaranteed to catch every defect. D is not 
right because you shouldn't be designing a system where you have to sort good items from 
bad after implementation. C is an accepted norm of modern quality management and the 
reason why acceptance sampling is followed. 

99. What is acceptance Sampling. What are referred as consumer's and producer’ s risk? 

Acceptance Sampling: is accepting a lot on the basis of inspecting a small representative 
sample, rather than the whole population. The acceptance level is specified beforehand. 

Producer's risk versus Consumer's risk: While doing sample inspection, we may come to 
the following four situations: 
1. Lot is actually good and is certified as good – nobody’ s risk 
2. Lot is actually bad and is certified as bad – nobody’ s risk 
3. Lot is actually bad, but is certified as good – consumer's risk 
4. Lot is actually good, but is certified as bad – producer's risk 

100. The specifications for a particular part are "10 +/-0.015". The associated process 
produce parts with a mean of 10 and a standard deviation of 0.002. The process 
capability index is: 

a. 0.0002 
b. 1.0 
c. 2.5 
d. 7.5 

Answer is c 

Process Capability Index is the expected fraction of non-conform ing units and is given by: 
PCI = (Upper Spec Lim it - Lower Spec Lim it) / (6 Sigma) 
= (10.015 - 9.985) / (6 * 0.002) 
= 0.03 / 0.012 = 2.5, so answer is c. 

101. A process characteristic has a true (population) mean of 150 and a true (population) 
standard deviation of 20. A sample of 25 items is taken from this process. The 
standard deviation of the sample is:  

a. 0.2 
b. 0.8 
c. 4.0 
d. 5.0 

Answer is c 

The “ Std Dev of the sample” is = (SD of population) / Sqrt(sample)  
= 20 / sqrt(25) = 20/5 = 4  and the answer is c. 

102. Can anyone explain what is the meaning of Tic Chart and what is the purpose of the 
same? 

It is called a Tic Sheet or a Check Sheet. The Check Sheet is used to keep track of the 
frequency with which certain things occur. For example, the number of times the machine 
broke down etc. Tally marks are used for keeping track of the occurrences. 

103. The customer has negotiated a cost plus incentive fee contract with a vendor. The 
contract has a target cost of 300,000, a target fee of 40,000, a share ratio of 80/20, a 
maximum fee of 60,000, and a minimum fee of $10,000. If the seller has actual costs 
of 380,000, how much fee will the vendor collect? 

a) $10,000 
b) $24,000 
c) $60,000 
d) $404,000 

Answer: b 

The CPIF is a theoretically a cost-reimbursable contract. However, with the addition of the 
share ratio and the incentive fee, thresholds are set for the m inimum and max fee that the 
vendor can achieve. So, if the actual cost was much lesser than the target cost, the sum of 
the vendor's share of the cost savings plus the target fee will still cap at the max or ceiling 
fee. Sim ilarly, even if there were major cost overruns, the vendor would be assured of 
getting the m inimum fee.  

In this particular example, the max and m in fee seem to be extraneous information (we 
don't need to use them). 

Target cost = 300K, Actual cost = 380K 
Target fee = 40K, Max fee = 60K, Min fee = 10K 
Share ratio = 80/20 

Cost overrun = (380K – 300K) = 80K 
Vendor's share of the cost overrun is 20% of 80K = 16K 
Vendor ’ s fee = target fee - vendor's share of cost overrun  
= 40K – 16K = 24K 
We make sure that the vendor fee is greater than the m in fee and not greater than the max 
fee. 

So, the answer is (b). The vendor will collect 24,000. 

Minimum and Maximum Fee caps will be useful in the following cases: If the actual costs 
are more than $450,000, the seller will pay 20% of the $150,000 over target, $30,000.  At 
this point, the sellers fee is at the m inimum of $10,000, and the seller will get this amount of 
profit no matter how much more over-budget the project goes. 

If the actual costs are less $200,000, the seller collects 20% of the $100,000 under budget, 
or $20,000 dollars.  The fee will be at the maximum of $60,000, and the seller will get this 
fee no matter how much more under-budget the project goes. 

104. A company is considering an investment of $80,000 at the present time. There is a 
55% probability that the investment will perform well and a 45% probability that it will 
perform poorly. If the investment performs well, the payoff will be $200,000 one year 
from now. If it performs poorly, the project will be retired at no cost one year from 
now. Assuming a 10% discount rate, should the company make that investment? 

A. Yes, since $200,000 > $80,000 
B. Yes, since $100,000 > $80,000 
C. No, since $80,000 < $100,000 
D. Yes, since the project may be retired at no cost. 

Answer: B.  

There is 55% chance that the project will succeed and it if it succeeds, the payoff will be 
$200,000. So the expected value of success is 0.55 * 200,000 = 110,000. 
The Present Value of this at time 0 (NOW ) at a discount rate of 10% is 110,000/(1.1)**1 = 
100,000 – this is ROI (return of Investment). 
If there is a loss, at time 0 (NOW ), all we lose is $80,000 – this is investment. 
Since $100,000 > $80,000 (choice B), the investment should be made. 

105. Measuring the probability and consequences of risks is part of 

A.  Risk management planning 
B.  Risk identification 
C.  Qualitative risk analysis 
D.  Quantitative risk analysis 

My answer: A (I feel the answer should be C.) 
My opinion, the key word in this question is "Measuring".  This would imply D - quantitative

the first steps to take is to: 

a. Revise project plan 
b. Conduct a risk-benefit analysis 
c. Conduct a needs analysis 
d. Increase the estimated cost of the project 

I would pick B - conduct a risk benefit analysis, because the first thing you want to do is 
understand the nature of the risk. How you respond this analysis may result in any of the 
other three actions. 

107. One of the engineers on your team performs a presentation to a perspective client 
about a proposed design. In answering questions, the engineer reveals that she

damage control. If there are pending design issues, these should be noted in the 
presentation, and the engineer's comments can be placed in the context of these noted 
issues. B puts the loose cannon engineer in the driver's seat, and solicits design decisions 
from the client. I am assuming that the client is using the project team for it's expertise, and 
as such should not be involved in these decisions. C again involves the client in the design 
process. D allows the PM to regain control of the meeting, and allows the client to respond 
to the issue so they don't think anything is being swept under the rug, but the PM is not 
making any comm itment to any particular course of action. This would be my second 
choice, and I would do this if the client pressed the issue. Still, by airing the issue in front of 
the client, you will increase the client's angst about the project. 
The PM needs to provide immediate feedback to the engineer after the meeting in a 
situation like this. When a client is depending on the expertise of the project team, it is 
imperative that the team provides a uniform face to the client, and that all conflict be 
resolved internally instead of in front of the client. Open conflict in front of the client will 
underm ine the client's confidence in the project team and jeopardize the project. If the 
engineer has issues with the design, those should be discussed openly at internal project 
meetings, and resolution should be reached internally, and then everybody should abide by 
the resolution. 

108. Communication is the key to the success of a project. As the project manager, you 
have four stakeholders with whom you need to communicate.  As such, you have six 
channels of communication. A new stakeholder has been added that you also need 
to communicate with. How many communication channels do you have now? 

A. 7 

B. 10 
C. 12 
D. 16 

Answer: 5*4/2 = 10, B. 
But I think this is wrong.  If you are the PM and have four stakeholders to communicate 
with, there are 5 people involved and 10 channels.  When you add a new stakeholder, you 
have 6 people and 15 channels. 
The formula stated in this question is N(N-1)/2 where N equals the number of people. 

How to derive this Formula: The Attached calculation will help to realize the concept of 
communication channel.  
Say, there are “ n” Persons and they are having communication with each other. We need 
to find how many communication channels are possible here.  
Take the case of the first person. He can communicate with rest of the (n-1) person. So, 
here are (n-1) communication channels. 
The Second person can communicate with ((n-1)-1) person because his communication 
with the first person is already taken into account for the calculation of first person. So, here 
are (n-2) communication channels. 
Sim ilarly, the third person can communicate with ((n-1)-2) because his communication with 
the first and second person is already taken into account for the calculation of first and 
second person. So, it’ s (n-3) channels.  
Like that, if we proceed, the total no of Channels used by n person, will be = (n-1)+(n-2)+(n-
3)+......+1 = 1+2+3+.....+(n-1)  
We have a sum of an AP series for "(n-1)" number whose first number is "1" and the 
common difference is also "1".  
The Formula for Sum of AP series is: S = n[2a+(n-1)d]/2  
(where, n = total numbers, a = first number, d = common difference) 
So, it gives us the Total Communication Channel  
=(n-1)*[2*1+((n-1)-1)*1]/2 = (n-1)*[2+(n-2)]/2 = n*(n-1)/2  
Hope this helps. 

109. Project Managers need to resolve conflicts primarily with: 

a. Superiors 
b. Subordinates 
c. Functional personnel 
d. Sponsors 

I would pick C - Functional Personnel. Functional Managers have a different agenda than 
the project manager, and different functional managers have different agendas from each 
other. They frequently are in competition with each other for company resources and 
political influence, and they may get no direct benefit from supporting your project. 
Functional workers who are involved with your project frequently have additional 
responsibilities outside of the project and are responsible primarily to their functional 
managers, and are only indirectly responsible to the project manager. All of these factors 
tend to make cross-functional projects focal points for conflicts that may be larger than the 
project itself. For each of the other choices: superiors, subordinates, and sponsors, the 
relationship with the project manager is much more clear and well defined, so there is less 
opportunity for conflict. 

110. Which of the following questions is a functional Manager most likely to ask: 

a. How much money is available to do the task? 
b. W hy will the task be done? 
c. Who will do the task? 

d. W hen will the task be done? 

Answer: c 
‘ A ’ is a budget question that should have nothing to do with the Functional Manager's area 
of responsibility. ‘ B ’ again is a Project Justification which should be part of the Scope 
Statement and hence the PM's responsibility ‘ D ’ is a schedule question, which is the 
responsibility of the PM. So, the answer is ‘ C ’ , because in a matrix organization, the 
Functional Manager holds the resources and the PM will have to request and negotiate for 
the resources needed for the project. Hence, a Functional Manager is most likely to ask 
"who will do the task". 

111. An individual who is still working on the satisfaction of physiological needs had 
essentially satisfied which needs: 

a. Safety 
b. Empowerment/Authority 
c. Self preservation 
d. Self Esteem 

Answer C 
This is slightly confusing. By the process of elim ination, we know (based on Maslow's 
Hierarchy of Needs - Physiological, Safety, Social, Self-Esteem and Self-Actualization) that 
"Safety" is the second level. Sim ilarly, Self-Esteem is at the fourth level.  
Empowerment or authority (even though not part of Maslow's theory) is still not something 
that would have already been satisfied for someone who is still trying to meet basic 
physiological needs of food, shelter and clothing. This leaves only ‘ C ’ – Self-preservation. 
To me, self-preservation represents the high end of the Physiological needs and the low 
end of the Safety need. 
Hence even though I would choose ‘ C ’ , it does not seem like a clear-cut answer. It just 
seems to be the best choice. 

112. Each Organization measures project team performance in its own way. However on 
which combination of the following objectives do most managers seem to agree? 

a. Achievement of technical specification and staying within budget 
b. Achievement of technical specifications, staying within budget, on time performance and 
team members ’ professional growth 
c. Achievement of technical specifications, on time performance and staying with budget 
d. Staying within budget and on time performance 

Answer is c 
“ Project Team Performance” surely will not be right if project result does not maintain 
‘ technical specification ’ (it ’ s a Scope) – hence choice D is out. Other two important 
components of Triple Constraints are Time and Cost. Choice A has only Scope and Cost. 
All three (Scope, Time and Cost) are covered in choice C and B. But many organization 
may not give much importance to the fourth factor – ‘ Team members ’ professional growth ’ 
– of choice B, as the project may be done under contract and buyer company may not be 
interested on this aspect, at all. Hence, the right choice is C.  

113. The Project Manager's ability to influence others using power derived from the same 
source as Reward Power, is called: 

a. De facto Authority 
b. Charter Authority 
c. Penalty Power 
d. Referent power 

Answer is C 
Reward Power is based on the right of the PM to offer rewards to others for doing what is 
wanted or expected of them and to be able to deny the reward for failing to do what is 
desired or expected of them. So "reward" is "positive reward" and "penalty" is "negative 
reward" and both are derived from the same source called Reward Power. Hence Answer 
C. 

114. In the PMP Exam Preparation book by ESI, page 5-9 I found the following sentence: 
"Monte Carlo analysis is considered a superior approach to analyzing the schedule 
when compared to PERT and CPM. This is true because PERT and CPM fail to 
account for path convergence and, as a result, tend to underestimate project 
durations". Can anybody explain me the concept about path convergence and why 
Monte Carlo analysis is the best way to analyze schedule? 

Answer: Path convergence and Monte Carlo analyze Path convergence, in this context, 
means that several different paths converge to the same node.  From a probabilistic 
viewpoint, there are several possible paths for the critical path. The problem with CPM, or 
with using PERT with the "most likely" estimates, is that only one path is considered. For 
example, consider a project with only two tasks in parallel: 

Task A: Pessim istic: 5, Likely: 4, Optim istic: 3 
Task B: Pessim istic: 10, Likely: 3, Optim istic: 2 

PERT or CPM would say Task A was on the critical path. However, there's a chance that 
Task B will take longer, and that Task B will actually be on the critical path. A Monte Carlo 
simulation would take this into account. This is especially important in large projects where 
the network diagram is complex. A Monte Carlo simulation can identify "near critical" paths. 

115. An RFP is issued during which step in the procurement process? 

a.  Procurement Planning 
b.  Solicitation Planning 
c.  Solicitation 
d.  Source selection 

The book Answer is b.  

I disagree; the answer should be C. Solicitation involves obtaining responses from 
prospective proposer. So, if this were true, the RFP would have to be issued in the 
solicitation process NOT the Solicitation Planning Process. The solicitation planning 
process would involve developing the RFP prior to issuing the RFP to prospective 
proposers. In fact, the RFP document is an input into the solicitation process. Therefore, an 
RFP cannot be issued until after the solicitation planning process which in this case would 
be the solicitation process.   

I agree with most of what you are saying, except for the piece that is about RFP being an 
input to the solicitation process. 
As I understood it, Solicitation Planning is the process where you prepare the Request for 
Proposal (RFP). And as documented in the PMBOK, RFP is an output of the Solicitation 
Planning process. So, even though issuing an RFP is the last process of Solicitation 
Planning, it still belongs there. It is a deliverable of Solicitation Planning. Solicitation is the 
process where we get the response to the RFP or the "Proposal" from the various qualified 
vendors. So, the input to the Solicitation process is the "response to the RFP" and not the 
"RFP". The PMBOK categorizes both the output of the Solicitation Planning process and 
the input to the Solicitation process under the general "Procurement Documents" heading. 

The detail description for each does differentiate the kind of procurement document 
associated with each process. So, I would be comfortable with Answer (B). 

116. In which type of organization is team building likely to be most difficult. 

a. Functional 
b. Projectized 
c. Matrix 
d. Project expeditor 

I hope the answer is C. 

I would agree with C, as a matrix organization would require the team to report to two 
different managers (the PM and the functional manager). That would make team and 
morale building more difficult than in the other cases where you have loyalty to only one 
manager (Functional Manger in cases (a) and (d) and the PM in (b)). 

117. There are hard causes of conflict (e.g. conflicting schedules) and soft causes. Soft 
causes are as important as hard causes. Soft causes include diversity of disciplinary 
expertise, __________ and the project manager's power of reward and punishment. 

a. Performance tradeoff 
b. Ambiguity of roles 
c. Adm inistrative procedure 
d. Determ ining earned values 

Answer: B 
The seven causes of "hard conflict" are: (1) Schedules, (2) Priorities, (3) Resources, (4) 
Technical issues, (5) Adm inistrative issues, (6) Personality and (7) Cost.  
‘ A ’ relates to technical issues. ‘ C ’ relates to adm inistrative issues and ‘ D ’ relates to cost 
conflicts. So, the answer is ‘ B ’ - ambiguity of roles that is a "soft cause. 
Other soft causes include: lack of perceived relationships between the project's goals and 
top management's goals, lack of open support for the project by senior management etc.  

118. The Conflict resolution method that should be used when there is a high concern for 
personal goals and a high concern for relationships is: 

a. Problem solving 
b. Comprom ising 
c. Smoothing 
d. Forcing 

“ Comprom ising” provides average concern for personal goals and average concern for 
relationships. Neither side wins nor looses. “ Smoothing” - high for relationships because 
disagreements appear m inim ized and low for personal goals because does not really lead 
to a permanent solution. Conflict is just pushed to a future time. “ Forcing” - high for 
personal goals because one party gets exactly what they needed. Low for relationships as 
this is not a good way to foster team building. So, correct answer is A. “ Problem solving” - 
high for personal goals as the correct solution is chosen and there is less room for 
ambiguity leading to high for relationships, as the conflict is permanently resolved. 

119. Your client informs that his company has a problem with the current design specs of 
your product and how it will interface with the existing systems. If this occurs, it 
could be a major problem for your project. The client is coming to your office in one 
week to discuss the problem and to see what your team can do to overcome this 

setback. All previous meetings were informal with this client, but now he wants a 
formal meeting. What should you do to prepare for this meeting? 

a) Update the schedules and assume an active role since the client has not given you the 
specifics of the potential problem  
b) Make sure that the team has increased productivity so the client can see how efficient 
your team is perform ing 
c) Assemble the team and ask them to prepare an agenda for topics to discuss 
d) Make sure that each team member has his assignment in preparation for any handouts 
and needed plans  

‘ B ’ is not correct, as no mention about productivity has come about. ‘ C ’ is not right because 
the client has requested the meeting and should have his/her own agenda of topics to 
discuss. If this were a regular status review meeting, the PM would prepare the agenda. ‘ D ’ 
is a waste of time when you don't know the true agenda. ‘ A’ is the correct response given 
that the client has not described the true problem. If this is a design issue that the client had 
originally signed off, what could be needed m ight be an appropriate Change Request. 
There is also the chance that the client has m isunderstood the issue and there is no real 
problem. All the PM can do is assume an active role and be prepared to resolve the 
stakeholder's issues. 

120. Listening involves more than hearing sounds. The good listener 

a) Repeats some of the things said 
b) Finishes the speaker's sentence 
c) W rites everything down 
d) Nods his head frequently 

B is bad listening. C is not good listening because you are not concentrating on what the 
other person is saying. Now, it gets confusing because a good listener should provide 
feedback by repeating or summarizing some of the things said (A). A good listener should 
also node (D) frequently to show that they understand and that they are listening.  
So, A and D both seem correct. Can someone else clarify... 

121. Which of the following is associated with a buyer's request for material to meet a 
particular need: 

a) Material warranty 
b) Material guarantee 
c) Implied warranty of salability 
d) Implied warranty of fitness for a particular purpose 
e) A and C only 

A warranty or guarantee as in (A or B) above should just be an agreement to deliver the 
goods or services in a non-defective condition. Implied warranty of salability (C) or 
merchantability just says that the goods should be suitable for the general purpose that 
such goods are used for. Implied warranty of fitness for a particular purpose (D) refers to 
the warranty that the goods sold to the buyer are suitable for the special purpose of the 
buyer. So, answer would be D. 

122. What does letter of agreement include?  

a) Meeting information and feedback 
b) Project description and signature 
c) Goal and budget 
d) Reports and communication plan 

As I understand it, Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) and Letter of Intent/Agreement 
(LOI/LOA) are all pre-contract agreement that will authorize the beginning of work before 
the actual contract is signed. I would think that a LOA should have the goal and the budget, 
indicating how much money is available to begin the work. So answer is C. The answer 
cannot be A or D, because that does not authorize the beginning of work. B or the actual 
project description and the signature should be part of the actual contract. 

123. A project Manager is creating a Risk Management Plan. What step of Risk 
Management is Project Manager in? 

A. Risk identification 
B. Risk quantification 
C. Risk Response Development 
D. Risk Response Control 

Answer provided is C.  
How is that possible? I understanding is RMP is developed in Risk Management Planning 
per PMBOK 2000ed. Please give your feedbacks. 
According to PMBOK page 38 and page 128, the output from the Risk Management 
Planning Process is the Risk Management Plan. Therefore, developing the Risk 
Management Plan is done during the planning stage. The Risk Management Plan is the 
"...process of deciding how to approach and plan the risk management activities for a 
project" (PMBOK page 129). Clearly, the answer to the question is incorrect. 

124. Constructive team roles include: 

A. Encourager, initiator and gatekeeper. 
B. Information giver, devil's advocate and clarifier. 
C. W ithdrawer, harmonizer and blocker. 
D. Summarizer, recognition seeker and information seeker. 

Correct Answer: A 
Constructive and destructive are team roles that indicate how your attitude effects overall 
team development. A constructive team role is one that helps team development and a 
destructive one is that which hampers team development. 

Accordingly, Constructive team roles are: 
1. Initiator - lets do this 
2. Information seeker - don't we have better information? 
3. Information giver - My experience has been that... 
4. Encourager - Mary, that was very helpful 
5. Clarifiers - I believe we are saying that.... 
6. Gate Keeper - W e have not heard Mary's opinion on this issue yet. What do you think, 
Mary? 
7. Harmonizer - I believe that we are all saying the same thing 
8. Summarizer - I feel that we can now reach an agreement 

As opposed to the above positive roles, Destructive team roles are: 
1. Aggressor – criticizes and attempts to deflate other 
2. Blocker – does not want to listen to what other people say 
3. W ithdrawer – is withdrawn 
4. Recognition seeker – sole purpose is to attract attention and gain recognition 
5. Topic jumper – jumps topics 
6. Dom inator – dom inates the discussion 
7. Devil's advocate –
 always pokes hole in other's logic 

As you can see, B, C and D have a destructive role each. A is the correct answer with all 
three roles being constructive 

[Note: Devils Advocate is normally used for a constructive purpose. A person plays the role 
of negating many suggestions to evoke team members to participate and come up with 
ideas. It’ s commonly used as an idea generation technique. Hence I feel Devil's Advocate 
is not a destructive role. It is true that it can be positive or negative. I have usually seen it 
classified as "destructive" just because when used in extreme, you really prevent others 
from feeling safe enough to voice their own opinion.] 

125. A lessons learned is BEST completed by: 

a.  Project Manger 
b.  Team 
c.  Management 
d.  Stakeholder. 
Answer: D 
My answer is B (Team), Rita’ s answer is D (Stakeholder). The team (or people in the team) 
who went through the project and know the m istakes made, error, etc. 
[Ref: PMBOK 2000 page 16] 
Project Stakeholders are individuals and organizations, who are actively involved in the 
project or whose interests may be positively or negatively affected by the result of the 
project execution. Key Stakeholders include: Project Manager, Customer, Perform ing 
Organization, Project Team Members and Sponsor. Since the stakeholders ’ interest is 
affected (positively or negatively), they are best candidates for capturing the lessons 
learned.  And please note that the project team is the subset of Project Stakeholders. 
[I elaborate it here…
.] 
The sponsor and management are in the best position to judge the success of the project, 
and they probably can provide the most important input to the lessons learned documents.  
Specifically, you need to find out if they were adequately informed of project issues, what 
issues they considered to be important, and if they felt you had the project under control (if 
not, why not), and if they feel their business needs were addressed by the project.  The 
lessons learned meeting also provides an excellent opportunity to get feedback from your 
superiors outside of the formal review process.  You should have a lessons learned 
meeting with them, and invite any senior team members that you m ight be groom ing for 
management. 
You should have a separate meeting with the team members to find if they were 
adequately supported in their efforts to execute the project, and what their perceptions on 
the execution of the project were.  This is the meeting where you find out how effective you 
were as a leader.  As their leader and manager, it's your job to give the team members 
what they need to perform well, whether it is clear direction, needed resources, motivation, 
or a KITA.  Also, as you indicate in your question, the team has the most information about 
the project execution, and they know about many issues of which (hopefully) everyone 
outside the project is ignorant.  But by the same token, many team members are 
completely oblivious to the business needs of their employers, or to the entire concept of 
fitness of use for the client. 
You should have yet another meeting with the client to ensure that the end product was 
what they expected.  They don't necessarily need to get everything they wanted, but there 
should be no surprises come the delivery date. 
Lessons learned should be gathered from all of these sources, i.e. all of the stakeholders. If 
you include only the team members you are lim iting the utility of the lessons learned 
documents. 
[It’ s not yet over …
] 
For the purposes of passing the PMP Exam, look at the first mention of Lessons Learned in 
the PMBOK, page 49. Lessons Learned become part of the historical database for the 

present project and other projects of the perform ing organization. The organization that 
does the work of the project should perform the lessons learned. The project work is 
accomplished by the 'team', therefore the team does the lessons learned so they can 
improve what they do for the next phase of the project or for the next project. So the 
answer should be B. 

126. Using the data shown: TARGET COST: 12,000, TARGET FEE: 1000, SHARE RATION: 
80/20 and PRICE CEILING: 14,000. The point of total assumption occurs at a cost of: 

A. 12,250 
B. 12,750 
C. 13,250 
D. 14,000 

The answer listed is: C (13,250 ???????) 
The Point of Total Assumption (PTA) is related to Fixed Price Incentive contracts. It is 
the point at which seller assumes 100% of the cost overruns (just before the ceiling price is 
reached). At this point, Actual Cost plus Actual Fee equals to the Ceiling Price. It is the 
point where a FPIF contract turns into a Firm Fixed Price contract, because at this point the 
profit the seller will make equals what he/she has already spent on it. So, the only way to 
make money is to continue with the project.  

PTA = Target Cost + (Ceiling Price - Target Price) / Buyer's Share 

Target Cost = 12000 
Target Fee = 1000 
Target Price = 12000 + 1000 = 13000 
Ceiling Price = 14000 
Buyer's ratio = 80% 

PTA = 12000 + (14000 - 13000)/0.8 = 13250. So, answer is (C). 

[Check this way…
] 
When Actual Cost = 13250, cost overrun is 13250 – 12000 = 1250. So Incentive (actually 
penalty) = -1250 * 0.20 = -250 and Net Fee = 1000 – 250 = 750. Hence, Actual Price = 
13250 + 750 = 14000. This is also equal to Ceiling Price.  

127. Using the data shown: TARGET COST: 12,000, TARGET FEE: 1000, SHARE RATION: 
80/20 and PRICE CEILING: 14,000. The profit at the point of total assumption is: 

A. 300 
B. 500 
C. 750 
D. 800 

The answer listed is C (750 ?????????) 
Same as above, PTA = 13250. We need to calculate profit at PTA.  
PTA = 13250 means  
Actual Cost = 13250 and Actual price = Ceiling price = 14000. 
So, the Actual fee = 14000 – 13250 = 750. Answer is C. 
[Or] 
At PTA, cost overrun = 13250 - 12000 = 1250 
Seller's share of the cost overrun = 20% of 1250 = 250 
Actual Fee = Target Fee - Seller's share of cost overrun  
= 1000 - 250 = 750. 

128. Using the information provided, if a project manager requires the use of a piece of 
equipment, how many days must he rent the equipment before the cost is equal to 
the total cost of leasing the equipment for one year? 

Rent Cost 

Leasing Cost 

Annual Maint:  
0 
Daily Operation:  0 
Daily Rental 

3,000 
   70 

100 

    0 

The answer listed is: 100 days ????????? 
Rental cost = 100 per day 
Lease cost = 3000 + 70 per day 
Say, in x days after Rental Cost equals to Leasing cost. At this point: 100 x = 3000 + 70 x. 
So, x = 100 days 

129. Project Risk Management includes all of the following processes except: [source: 
PMP Sample questions (Q#124) - self compiled in Yahoo group.] 

A. Risk Quantification 
B. Risk Identification 
C. Risk Analysis 
D. Risk Response Development 
E. Risk Response Control 

Given answer is C, my answer was E.  There is nothing like 'Risk Response control', hence 
I choose E. 

I believe Question #124 is another of those outdated Risk questions that should be 
elim inated from the bank of practice questions.   

The 1996 PMBoK Guide identifies four processes in Project Risk Management; Risk 
Identification, Risk Quantification, Risk Response Development and Risk Response 
Control. So, based on 1996 standards, 'C' is correct. However, we are now working with the 
2000 PMBoK Guide and things have changed significantly with respect to Project Risk 
Management. 

In the 2000 edition, Project Risk Management is comprised of six processes; Risk 
Management Planning, Risk Identification, Qualitative Risk Analysis, Quantitative Risk 
Analysis, Risk Response Planning and Risk Monitoring and Control.   

130. During risk planning your team cannot come up with an effective to mitigate or insure 
against a risk. It ’ s not a task that can be outsourced, nor could it be deleted. What is 
the BEST solution? 

A. Accept the risk 
B. Continue to investigate ways to m itigate the risk 
C. Look for ways to avoid risk 
D. Look for ways to transfer the risk 

Given answer is A.  
[#1] My answer is C. Between ACCEPTING or AVOIDING a risk, I think AVOIDING is a 
better choice. Especially you ’ re in the planning stage hence you can avoid the risk 
completely. The question says you cannot m itigate or transfer the risk, so you can either 
avoid or accept. So why would any one accept a risk if you have a option of completely 
avoiding it.  
What are your thoughts... 

[#2] The question says, "risk could not be deleted". I took that to mean that it could not be 
avoided. So, the only available option is to accept it (A) - and probably develop contingency 
plans for it. 
[#3] Personally, I think there are two types of situations: (1) one, where you do not have to 
suffer from the consequences of the risk (i.e. avoid, transfer) and (2) another, where you 
have to deal with the consequences (i.e. m itigate, accept). Following that hypothesis, 
obviously for a project it would be BEST to (1) avoid the materialization of the risk 
completely (the impact is 0%), if not possible then (2) transfer it (only an insurance fee 
m ight remain, if at all and the impact is almost 0% to you), if not possible then (3) m itigate 
(m inim ize the impact to be less than 100%) and even it is not possible then (4) accept it 
(the impact obviously will be 100%). 

131. A scenario is presented in which current variances are seen as typical. Here are the 
figures: PV=800, BAC=700, EV=675, AC=750. 

A. 778 
B. 780 
C. 861 
D. 833 

The answer is given as C, with the following explanation: EAC = [AC +  (BAC - EV) / .9] = 
861.11 or 861 rounded down. 
[#1] In order to get this answer, you have to ADD the remaining budget  (BAC - EV) to AC 
and THEN divide the sum by CPI. But that's contrary to what the parentheses indicate in 
PMBOK, that is: EAC = AC + ((BAC - EV)/CPI). Now, if you were to obey the order of 
operation implied in PMBOK, you'd come up with 777.77 or 778 rounded up, which is 
answer A. So which one is it - 778 or 861? 
[#2] Actually, even though the formulas have a different meaning based on the context, 
mathematically they are the same: 
EAC = BAC / CPI with no variance 
EAC = AC + ( BAC - EV ) / CPI with variance, based on performance 
But, CPI = EV / AC, so  
EAC = AC + ( BAC - EV ) / CPI 
    = AC + BAC / CPI - EV / CPI 
    = AC + BAC / CPI - EV / ( EV / AC ) 
    = AC + BAC / CPI - EV * ( AC / EV ) 
    = AC + BAC / CPI - AC 
    = BAC / CPI 
Why does this work?  When there is no variance, the CPI should be 1, and the EAC should 
be the BAC. 
[#3] Forget about all that and just use BAC / CPI (see derivation below): 
700 / 0.9 = 778. 
You are right, the book is wrong. 

132. Which approach to creating a WBS is often used for projects that involve new 
systems or approaches for doing a job? 

A: Template approach 
B: Bottom-up approach 
C: analogy approach 
D: Top-Down approach 

Given Answer is B.  
[#1] My answer was D. We decompose the scope statement to create a WBS. We start 
with a high level and drill down to lower levels.  Especially in this situation when its a new 
system, we do not know the details hence start with the top. 

[#2] W ell, first of all, we know C & A are elim inated for use on a "new systems" project. 
However, there is a piece of information m issing from the question which would make it 
difficult to choose between B & D. Generally, projects with less precedent (ie R&D or new 
products) are characterized by greater risk, particularly if they are also associated with high 
cost. A definitive (bottom-up) estimate could serve to m itigate the risk in that case because 
it is more accurate. However, it is also a more expensive and time-consum ing type of 
estimate so what's m issing from the question is whether or not you have the luxury of the 
time & money to invest in this approach. Remember that just because it is a "new systems" 
project doesn't mean a bottom-up estimate is precluded, because you could always 
approach it with the Moving Wave technique described in Kerzner, meaning that you take 
the first phase of the project down to WBS Level 4 and leave the second phase only 
roughly defined down to Level 2 until you've advanced far enough to be able to define it.  
However, since the magnitude of the project (in time & budget) is not given in this question, 
I would go with answer B.  
[#3] Top down approach is used only if you have enough historical information on the 
Project. in this case it is not true. Hence it would be appropriate to use Bottom up approach 
– so, answer is B. 

133. You have accepted a position at a company where you will manage a group of 
projects in a coordinated way. The organization specifically hired you to help it have 
a more structured approach to project management. What should you do first? 

A) Study books and articles about managing multiple projects 
B) Study the organizations strategic plan 
C) Meet with key stakeholders to better understand the organization and projects 
D) Focus on communications with your boss and other senior managers. 

The correct answer is C.  
[#1] My answer is B. Rationale behind my answer: 
Clearly the question is about facilitating program management. Program management 
helps in the realization of synergies that exist between projects. Projects are undertaken to 
implement the chosen strategy of the organization by addressing business need, market 
demand, technological advance, social/legal etc. In this sense, for successful program 
management one should know the perform ing organizations strategic plan. Rationale for 
correct answer (this is my take on this - no rationale was provided) The question deals with 
setting project management methodology for the organization. In that sense, one can ask 
for input from the key stakeholders. But it appears to be a rather indirect way to creation of 
a methodology. 
[#2] The question clearly states that you are being hired to apply a structured methodology 
to managing a group of projects. You are not at this time being asked to help the company 
evaluate whether or not to initiate a set of projects, so you cannot assume that you are to 
play a role in Initiation. Remember that it is in Initiation where the Strategic Plan is really an 
important input.  
"On most projects, the majority of the communication planning is done as part of the 
earliest project phases." (PMBOK 119) "According to the Guide to the PMBOK, 
stakeholders are officially identified in the Planning process. In practice, key stakeholders 
will have to be contacted early on to get their input for the project overview, goals, and 
deliverables."(Heldman, 60). Stakeholder Analysis is a tool & technique of TWO important 
planning processes: Organizational Planning and Communication Planning. 
It's not that you are supposed to interview stakeholders to get their feedback on your 
methodology. Rather, stakeholder analysis is one of the prelim inary steps in your 
methodology because it is one of the best means of defining the requirements/expectations 
of the project as well as establishing roles and reporting procedures. 

134. 2 people are arguing about what needs to be done to complete a task. If the project 
manager wants to know what is going on, she should pay MOST attention on: 

A. What is said 
B. What is being discussed according to those arguing 
C. Physical mannerisms 
D. The pitch and tone of the voice. 

Answer is C.   
[#1] I think A/B should be the way to know what is going on. Explanation is just about 55% 
of communication is non-verbal. This cannot convince me since I think the key point here is 
she needs to know the content of the arguing. How can C help on this? 
[#2] If the question asked what should she pay attention to, all four choices would be 
correct.  The question is asking what is the MOST important, and according to Rita, the 
non-verbal is the most important, i.e. 55% of communication, therefore that ranks #1.  The 
PM must still pay attention to what is said, etc.  She is not excluding the other information. 

135. What is the primary motivational tool of quality Theory X? 

A. Zero defects promotional campaign 
B. Use of the quality circle 
C. Transferred responsibility 
D. Financial compensation [Slide 9-32] 
E. Benchmarking 

[#1] Theory X: assumes workers dislike and avoid work, so managers must use coercion, 
threats and various control schemes to get workers to meet objectives. So my answer is D. 
[#2] Well, that would be correct for McGregor's Management Theory X. Never heard of 
Quality Theory X before. The only correlation I can see is that TQM is participative, more 
Theory Y oriented. 

136. A customer, after explaining performance needs for a prospective purchase, accepts 
the seller's recommendation. This is an example of: 

A. Solicitation 
B. Guarantee 
C. Implied warranty 
D. Buyer's warranty 
E. Caveat 

[#1] I'm guessing this is an Implied W arranty, C. 
A. A Solicitation is generally more encompassing than a verbal description of performance 
needs. The buyer describes what is required, and the seller, in the response, offers a 
product or service at some price to meet the requirements. This could be considered an 
example of a solicitation, but I don't think it's the best answer. 
B. A Guarantee provides some remedy if the product fails to meet some requirement. No 
such remedy is mentioned, and guarantees are written. 
C. An implied warranty is an unwritten assumption that the product offered is suitable for 
the purpose for which it is offered. An implied warranty applies if the buyer depends on the 
seller to select a product for a particular purpose. This seems to fit the example - the seller 
recommends a product, and there is no written warranty discussed. The "iffy" part of this 
example is that warranties do not cover quality, and performance could be construed to be 
a quality issue, rather than a suitability issue. It would be incumbent upon the buyer to 
explain to the seller that the product would be unsuitable if it did not meet the performance 
needs. Considering the unwritten nature of the implied warranty, I would want to get it in 
writing, which would then be an expressed warranty. 
D. Buyer's W arranty - I'm not sure what this is. If legally it is no different from a warranty, 
the implied warranty is a more specific, and thus better, answer. 
E. Caveat - This just means "warning". 

137. The concept that it is easier and less costly to do the work right the first time is 
called: 

A. Zero defects 
B. Continuous improvement 
C. DTRTRTFT 
D. The customer is the next person in the process 

Answer: C 
DTRTTFT is “ Do The Right Thing Right, The First Time” . Implies that it is easier and less 
costly to do the work right the first time than it is to do it the second time. Entails the training 
of personnel to ensure sufficient skills and tools to correctly complete the work. 

138. A company has to make a choice between two projects, because the available 
resources in money and kind are not sufficient to run both at the same time. Each 
project would take 9 months and would cost $250,000.   
The first project is a process optimization, which would result in a cost reduction of 
$120,000 per year. This benefit would be achieved immediately after the end of the 
project. 
The second project would be the development of a new product, which could 
produce the following net profits after the end of the project:  
1st year: $ 15,000  
2nd year: $ 125,000  
3rd year: $ 220,000  
Assumed is a discount rate of 5 % per year. Looking at the net present values of 
these projects' revenues in the first 3 years, what is true? 

A. The first project is more attractive.  
B. Both projects are equally attractive.  
C. The available information is not sufficient to calculate and compare net present values.  
D. The second project is more attractive.  

As, PV = FV/(1+r)^n. Since both projects will take same amount of time and money to 
develop, for purposes of comparison we can ignore the development cycle. 
Present Value for 1st project, PV1 = 120/1.05 + 120/1.05^2 + 120/1.05^3 = 114.286 + 
108.844 + 103.661 = 326.790.  
Present Value for 2nd project, PV2 = 15/1.05 + 125/1.05^2 + 220/1.05^3 = 14.286 + 
113.379 + 190.044 = 317.709.  
So the answer is A. 

139. Explain the difference between Responsibility Assignment Matrix (RAM) and Linear 
Responsibility Chart (LRC). 

[#1] Reading through current PM literature, it is not difficult find at least six or seven 
different terms used to define the general intent and application of a Responsibility 
Assignment Matrix (RAM). 'Linear Responsibility Chart (LRC)' appears to be one of them. 
The PMBoK Guide attempts to provide the most widely accepted definition, intent and 
application. Here's a bit more detail: 
The PMBoK Guide defines Responsibility Assignment Matrix (RAM) as 'a structure that 
relates the project organization structure to the work breakdown structure to help ensure 
that each element of the project's scope of work is assigned to a responsible individual.' A 
typical RAM in table form is illustrated in figure 9-2 on page 111.  
The PMBoK Guide also recognizes the terms 'Responsibility Chart' and 'Responsibility 
Matrix' as being synonymous with 'Responsibility Assignment Matrix (RAM).' 

To place in context, 'role and responsibility assignments' is a defined output of the 
Organizational Planning process ... and the RAM is identified as being 'often used to link 
the project scope definition to role and responsibility assignments.' In practice, the PMBoK 
Guide suggests that, for larger projects, RAMs be developed at various levels, perhaps a 
high-level RAM to define the groups responsible for WBS elements and a lower-level RAM 
to assign roles and responsibilities for specific activities to particular individuals. 
In some project management methodologies outside of 
the PMBoK Guide, 
the 
Responsibility Assignment Matrix (RAM) is also referred to as 'Responsibility/Accountability 
Matrix,' and 'Task Responsibility Matrix.'  Specific definitions vary, but remain closely 
related. 
The PMBoK Guide 2000 does not include any references to the term 'Linear Responsibility 
Chart.' However, outside of the PMBoK Guide, the term is defined as 'a special type of 
matrix in which the rows list the series of functions, activities, or tasks in some logic 
sequence, such as the project life cycle, and the adjacent columns identify the positions, 
titles or people involved. At the intersection of each adjacent column and its line item is 
placed a distinguishing symbol representing the level or type of responsibility involved by 
that person.' 
For PMP Exam purposes, it is important to know the PMBoK Guide definition of RAM ... 
and that a RAM is typically a table with rows and columns used to help link individual role 
and responsibility assignments to WBS elements during Organizational Planning. It would 
be helpful for candidates to fam iliarize themselves with the PMBoK Guide illustration (figure 
9-2 on page 111). W hile 'RAM' typically shows up in at least a few questions on most PMP 
Exams, I have not heard of any Exam since last March that refers to the term 'Linear 
Responsibility Chart.' 
[#2] The RAM shows who (what person/organization) is responsible for the individual 
deliverables in the WBS. The LRC identifies roles and responsibilities over the project, e.g. 
who runs meetings, who has change authority, who creates documents, who approves 
documents, etc.  I've used RAMs, but never an LRC, so in that respect my understanding is 
academ ic. 

140. Consider the information below, in which activities A, B, and D are on one path and 
must be performed in that sequence, and activity C is to be performed parallel to that 
path. Assuming cost is important, in which sequence should crashing of activities 
be planned? 
Normal Time: A=4, B=3, C=5, D=5 
Crash Time:  A=2, B-2, C=4, D=3 
Normal Cost: A=10, B=20, C=14, D=25 
Crash Cost:  A=11, B=22, C=16, D=27 
(Time in Weeks, Amounts in Thousands of Dollars) 

A. A,B,D 
B. A,D,B 
C. D,B,A 
D. A,B,C,D 

Answer is B; m ine was A. 

[#1] First of all, Task C is not on the critical path and does not really need to be crashed. If 
you rank the crashable tasks by cost in ascending order, then you come up with this 
sequence: A,B,D. Even if you only look at the incremental crashing cost (the difference 
between the crashing and normal cost), you would still come up with the same ranking. So 
then what is the argument for D,B,A? 

[#2] You are correct on your first statement. C is not in the critical path so it does not need 
to be taken into account. The answer is B (A,D,B) because: 
A: 4-2= 2 weeks crash --> 1K$ Increase--> 0.5K per week 

B: 3-2= 1 week crash ---> 2K$ Increase--> 2K per week 
D: 5-3= 2 week crash ---> 2K$ Increase--> 1K per week 
So first you choose A, because it provides you with the best crashing time at the lower cost. 
Then you have to choose between D & B. If we have to choose sequentially and cost is 
important: chose D that provides you with the most crash time at the lower cost. 

[#3] In a specific path crashing the activities has nothing to do with the sequence of 
operations; however the cost/time slope is the factor to consider - i.e. how much it costs 
you to save one day/week; the least the better. The analysis provided by Vanessa is 
absolutely correct. Think about it this way: if A, B & D are after each other, and it will cost 
you $1 to save a week if you crash D and $2 to save one week if you crash B – which one 
to crash first? Obviously D sense it will give you the best value of money. 

141. Management reserve is needed on projects. According to the PMBOK Guide, which of 
the following is true about management reserve? 

A. It allows for handling future situations that are impossible to predict 
B. It may involve cost but not schedule 
C. It is sometimes called "unknown knowns" 
D. Its use does not require a change in the project's baseline 

Answer is A  

[#1] Mine was C, Reference is PMBOK 143-144 Source: IIL PMIQ (based on Kerzner). D & 
B can pretty much be elim inated. So let's look at the reference to choose between A & C. A 
visual scan of pages 143-144 and an electronic search for the term "management 
reserves" in PMBOK returns no results. However, there is a definition of known vs unknown 
risks with regard to contingencies on p.129 that says "Known risks are those that have 
been identified and analyzed, and it may be possible to plan for them. Unknown risks 
cannot be managed, although the project managers may address them by applying a 
general contingency based upon past experience with sim ilar projects." 
PMBOK does not suggest that general (ie management) contingencies are for risks that are 
IMPOSSIBLE to predict. In fact, it suggests the opposite by saying that past experience 
would be the basis for determ ining the general contingency amounts!  
Kerzner's own definition (p. 833) also contradicts the question, leading me to believe it is an 
error on the CD: "Management reserves are the contingency funds established by the 
program manager to counteract unavoidable delays that can affect the project's critical 
path. Management reserves cover unforeseen events within a defined project scope taht 
experience has shown are likely to occur. Management reserves are not used for unlikely 
major force events or changes in scope." 
OK, so does everyone agree this test question is flawed? 

[#2] I disagree with you. I would have picked A as the answer. 
Management reserves are held by the sponsor, for his/her own needs, to ensure the project 
can be completed. The project manager should have defined his/her own contingency 
allowance based on risk, presumably to cover off the “ unknown-knowns ” . Keep in m ind that 
contingency allowance is distinct from management reserve. 

[#3] This is correct. To reinforce the point, Management Reserves belong to management, 
not to the Project Manager, and they are not part of the project plan. Management reserves 
are for the protection of management, not the project or the PM. The PM can include 
contingency in the project plan, based on risk analysis, but this is not management reserve. 
In the event of an unplanned-for risk event (an unknown-unknown), management reserves 
m ight be used to reduce the impact that the troubled project has on any other plans 
management m ight have.  Management reserve can take any number of forms, e.g. budget 

reserve (have extra cash budgeted to apply to troubled projects), or schedule reserve 
(telling you they need it by January and not planning for it to be available until May). 
Management reserves do protect the project, in the sense that, if the project is in trouble, 
they help prevent losing the business need for the project and thus prevent it from being 
cancelled.

Foreword

On behalf of the Project Management Institute (PMI威) Board of Directors, I am pleased
to present The Standard for Program Management.
Project management is one of those terms with multiple meanings. For a long time
it was associated only with projects, but some twenty years ago that began to change,
and today it is understood to include portfolio management and program management
as well.
Today the PMBOK威 Guide continues to be the de facto global standard for the
project management of single projects, as well as an American National Standard.
The Standard for Program Management describes a documented set of processes that
represent generally recognized good practices in the discipline of program manage-
ment. This significant new standard will do for programs and those working on pro-
grams what the PMBOK威 Guide has done for projects.
I would like to sincerely thank the globally diverse project team that worked so
diligently to bring this standard to fruition. The team, which consisted of a group of
416 PMI volunteers representing 36 countries, was led by project manager David W.
Ross, PMP, and assisted by deputy project manager Paul E. Shaltry, PMP. Dedicated
and competent volunteers have always been the backbone of PMI’s success, and this
publication is yet another example.
I trust that each of you will find this latest standard from PMI beneficial to yourself
as well as to your organization.

Preface

The Standard for Program Management will provide program managers the same
wealth of information that is available to project managers in ‘‘The Standard for Project
Management’’ in A Guide to the Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK威
Guide). The target audience for this standard includes: senior executives, portfolio
managers, program managers, project managers and their team members, members
of a project or program management office, managers of program managers and
project managers, customers and other stakeholders, educators, consultants, trainers
and researchers. The standard builds on work postulated in the Organizational Project
Management Maturity Model (OPM3威).
The processes documented within this standard are generally recognized good
practices and the necessary steps to successfully manage a program, and includes
practices and skills such as:
● Benefits management, stakeholder management, program governance, and how
these three themes are indispensable to successful program management.
● How program management can be used in organizational planning to ensure that
all programs and projects are aligned with organizational objectives, efficiently
coordinate work effort, and provide for the best use of resources within the pro-
grams.

Introduced to provide program managers with a resource to help them achieve
organizational goals, The Standard for Program Management aims to provide a detailed
understanding of program management and promote efficient and effective communi-
cation and coordination among various groups. With its ability to help assess the
variety of factors linking projects under one program and provide the best allotment
of resources between those projects, this standard is an invaluable tool for program
and project managers alike.
The Standard for Program Management is organized as follows:

Introduction

The Standard for Program Management provides guidelines for managing programs
w i th in an o rgan iza t ion . I t de f ines p rog ram managemen t and re la ted con cep t s ,
describes the program management life cycle and outlines related processes. This
standard is an expansion of information provided in A Guide to the Project Management
Body of Knowledge (PMBOK威 Guide). The PMBOK威 Guide is the accepted standard
describing the process of project management and the management of individual
projects throughout their life cycle. The PMBOK威 Guide briefly addresses the manage-
ment of multiple projects and other activities beyond the scope of managing individual
projects. Although the Organizational Project Management Maturity Model (OPM3威)
addresses project, program, and portfolio management, during its development, PMI
determined that additional standards were needed to address program and portfolio
management in detail. This standard fulfills the need for a standard for program
management.
This chapter defines and explains several key terms and provides an overview of
the rest of the document. It includes the following major sections:
1.1 Purpose of The Standard for Program Management
1.2 What is a Program?
1.3 What is Program Management?
1.4 The Relationship Between Program Management and Portfolio Management
1.5 The Relationship Between Program Management and Project Management
1.6 Program Management in Organizational Planning
1.7 Themes of Program Management

1.1 Purpose of The Standard for Program Management

The primary purpose of The Standard for Program Management is to describe generally
recognized good practices and place program management in the context of portfolio
and project management. This standard provides guidance for managing multiple
programs (that is multiple projects and non-project activities within a program envi-
ronment). The processes documented within this standard are generally accepted as
the necessary steps to successfully manage a program. In addition this standard pro-
vides a common lexicon leading to a detailed understanding of program management
among the following groups to promote efficient and effective communication and
coordination:

● Project managers, to understand the role of program managers and the relationship
and interface between project and program managers
● Program managers, to understand their appropriate role
● Portfolio managers, to understand the role of program managers and the relation-
ship and interface between program and portfolio managers
● Stakeholders, to understand the role of program managers and how they engage
the various stakeholder groups (e.g., users, executive management, client)
● Senior managers, to understand the role of executive sponsor as part of the program
board/steering committee.

1.2 What is a Program?

A program is a group of related projects managed in a coordinated way to obtain
benefits and control not available from managing them individually. Programs may
include elements of related work (e.g., ongoing operations) outside the scope of the
discrete projects in a program.
Programs and projects deliver benefits to organizations by enhancing current or
developing new capabilities for the organization to use. A benefit is an outcome of
actions and behaviors that provides utility to stakeholders. Benefits are gained by
initiating projects and programs that invest in the organization’s future. Programs,
like projects, are a means of achieving organizational goals and objectives, often in
the context of a strategic plan.
The terms program and program management have been in widespread use for
some time and have come to mean many different things. Some organizations and
industries refer to ongoing or cyclical streams of operational or functional work as
prog rams . The recogn ized d isc ip l ines o f ope ra t iona l or func t iona l management
address this type of work; therefore, this form of program is out of the scope of
this standard.
Alternatively, some organizations refer to large projects as programs. The manage-
ment of large individual projects or a large project that is broken into more easily
managed subprojects remains within the discipline of project management, and as
such, is already covered in the PMBOK威 Guide—Third Edition. If a large project is
split into multiple related projects with explicit management of the benefits, then the
effort becomes a program, and this Standard for Program Management is applicable
to managing that effort.
Programs, like projects, are a means of achieving organizational goals and objectives,
often in the context of a strategic plan. Although a group of projects within a program
can have discrete benefits, they often also contribute to consolidated benefits as
defined by the program, as depicted in Figure 1-1.

1.3 What is Program Management?

Program management is the centralized coordinated management of a program to
achieve the program’s strategic benefits and objectives. In addition, it allows for the
application of several broad management themes to help ensure the successful accom-
plishment of the program. These themes are: benefits management, stakeholder man-
agement, and program governance.
Managing multiple projects by means of a program allows for optimized or inte-
grated cost, schedules, or effort; integrated or dependent deliverables across the pro-

gram, delivery of incremental benefits, and optimization of staffing in the context of
the overall program’s needs. Projects may be interdependent because of the collective
capability that is delivered, or they may share a common attribute such as client,
customer, seller, technology, or resource.
A program may link projects in various other ways, including the following:
● Interdependencies of tasks among the projects, such as meeting a new regulatory
requirement for the organization or delivery of an enabling service
● Resource constraints that may affect projects within the program
● Risk mitigation activities that impact the direction or delivery of multiple projects
● Change in organizational direction that affects the work of projects and their rela-
tionships to other projects and work
● Escalation point for issues, scope changes, quality, communications management,
risks, or program interfaces/dependencies.
Program management focuses on these project interdependencies and determines
the optimal pacing for the program. This enables appropriate planning, scheduling,
executing, monitoring, and controlling of the projects within the program. In essence,
factors such as strategic benefits, coordinated planning, shared resources, interdepen-
dencies, and optimized pacing contribute to determining whether multiple projects
should be managed as a program.

1.4 The Relationship Between Program Management and
Portfolio Management

A portfolio is a collection of components (i.e., projects, programs, portfolios, and other
work such as maintenance and ongoing operations) that are grouped together to
facilitate the effective management of that work in order to meet strategic business

objectives. The projects or programs of the portfolio may not necessarily be interdepen-
dent or directly related.
A portfolio always exists within an organization and it is comprised of a set of
current initiatives. The initiatives may or may not be related, interdependent, or
properly managed as a portfolio. The portfolio may have been created by independent
efforts to authorize and launch projects without regard to strategic objectives or risks.
With portfolio management, the organization is able to align the portfolio to strategic
objectives, approve only components that directly support business objectives, and
consider the portfolio risk as a result of the mix of components in a portfolio at any
one time. Components may in fact be deferred by the organization when the risk of
adding one or more of them to the current portfolio would unreasonably upset the
balance and exceed the risk tolerance of the organization. As a result, the portfolio of
an organization represents a snap shot of its selected components, which reflects
strategic management or lack thereof and affects the strategic goals of the organization.
A portfolio is most likely one of the truest measures of an organization’s intent,
direction, and progress. It is where investment decisions are made, resources are
allocated, and priorities are identified. If a portfolio’s components are not aligned to
the strategy, the organization can reasonably question why they are being undertaken.
The difference can be made clearer. Portfolio management focuses on assuring that
programs and projects are viewed in priority for resource allocation (i.e., people,
funding) that is consistent with and aligned to organizational strategies. Programs focus
on achieving the benefits aligned with the portfolio and, subsequently, organizational
objectives. Figure 1-2 depicts the sometimes complex relationship between portfolios,
programs, projects, and related work.

Figure 1-2. Portfolios, Programs, and Projects—High-Level View

Interactions occur between the portfolio management processes and program man-
agement processes of most Program Management Process Groups. The type of interac-
tion and frequency will vary depending upon the needs of the Program Management
Process Group.
In general, the program’s Initiating and Planning Process Group will receive more
inputs from the portfolio domain than will the Executing, Monitoring and Controlling,
or Closing Process Groups. These inputs are often in the form of strategic goals and
benefits, funding allocations, requirements, timelines, and constraints that the pro-
gram team translates into the program scope, deliverables, budget, and schedule. The

direction of control will be more from the portfolio domain to the program domain,
whereas monitoring information will generally travel from program domain to portfolio
domain. Information flowing from the program ’s In it iating and P lann ing Process
Groups will typically consist of first or early views of scope development, cost estimates,
and timeline estimates.
Information flowing to the portfolio domain from the program’s Executing, Monitor-
ing and Controlling, and Closing Process Groups mainly contributes to providing
status information , program performance reports , budget and schedu le updates,
earned value cost performance reports, change requests and approved changes, and
escalating issues and risks. The frequency of these interactions will be dictated by the
frequency of the program’s review and update cycles and the reporting requirements
imposed by the portfolio management or governance team.
In summary, interactions between the program and portfolio domains fall into
several categories, as follows:
● Interactions related to initiating the program
● Interactions related to providing information to the portfolio domain during the
program life cycle
● Interactions related to closing the program
● Interactions related to providing changes to the program from the portfolio domain.

1.5 The Relationship Between Program Management and
Project Management

During a program’s life cycle, projects are initiated and the program manager oversees
and provides direction and guidance to the project managers. Program managers
coordinate efforts between projects but do not manage them. An essential program
management responsibility is the identification, rationalization, monitoring, and con-
trol of the interdependencies between projects; dealing with the escalated issues among
the projects that comprise the program; and tracking the contribution of each project
and the non-project work to the consolidated program benefits.
The integrative nature of program management processes involves coordinating
the processes for each of the projects or program packages. This applies through all
the Process Groups of Initiating, Planning, Executing, Monitoring and Controlling, and
Closing, and involves managing the processes at a level higher than those pertaining to
a project. An example of this type of integration is the management of issues and risks
needing resolution at the program level, because they cannot be addressed at the
individual project level.
Furthermore, processes between the program and project domains can be iterative.
Planning effectively for a program first requires a top-down and then a bottom-up
approach. This not only helps in obtaining relevant information at appropriate levels,
but helps obtain and validate buy-in from the stakeholders of a program. This type
of interaction of program-level processes with project-level processes can be found
during all stages of the program life cycle. An example of such an interaction can be
found during schedule development, where a detailed review of the overall schedule
at the project level is needed to validate information at the program level.
Similar to the interactions between the portfolio and program domains, the interac-
tions between program and project domains tend to be cyclical. Information flows
from the program to the projects in the early phases (initiating and planning) and
then flows from the projects to the program in the later phases of executing, controlling
and closing. The cycle is driven by the domain that is responsible for the given

interaction. Table 1-1 summarizes some of the differences between portfolios, pro-
grams, and projects.

Table 1-1. Comparative Overview of Project, Program, and Portfolio Management

1.6 Program Management in Organizational Planning

The primary context for program management within an organization is the planning
and execution of organizational plans. Programs can be thought of as the highest level
at which work is directed across multiple lines of business, although programs can
also support narrow single lines of business or functional areas of an organization.
How much success an organization will have with program management is determined
by the maturity of its policies, controls, and governance that define, communicate,
and align the organization’s goals.
During their life cycle, projects produce deliverables, whereas programs deliver
benefits and capabilities that the organization can utilize to sustain, enhance, and
deliver organizational goals.
Figure 1-3 illustrates the relationship between business initiatives in the strategic
cycle and portfolios, programs and projects.
The stylized program life cycle in Figure 1-4 illustrates the nonsequential nature of
program management with the mobilization of components to deliver a stream of
deliverables that facilitate new operations and benefits during the program’s life cycle.
Organizations address the need for change by creating strategic business initiatives
to modify the organization or its products. Organizations use portfolios, programs,
and projects to deliver these initiatives.
The organization must ensure that these portfolios, programs, and projects are:
● Aligned with organizational objectives or goals
● Comprised of the best mix of project investments
● Comprised of the best use of resources.

Some organizations may not use the portfolio as a top-level structure and the
program may be the entity at the top of the hierarchy of projects (see Figure 1-2).

1.7 Themes of Program Management

Organizations initiate programs to deliver benefits and accomplish agreed-upon out-
comes that often affect the entire organization. The organization of the program takes
this into account and balances stakeholder expectations, requirements, resources,
and timing conflicts across competing projects. Throughout its life cycle, an effective
program encompasses many a reas , however there a re th ree b road management
themes that are key to the success of a program:
● Benefits management
● Program stakeholder management
● Program governance.

89514$$CH1

04-05-06 17:42:23

These themes run like common threads throughout the program management life
cycle. The processes described in Chapter 2 on Program Life Cycle and Chapter 3 on
Program Management Processes illustrate how these themes are present at all stages.

1.7.1 Benefits Management

The first theme, benefits management as applied to programs, is the definition and
formalization of the expected benefits a program is intended to deliver. This includes
both tangible and intangible benefits and the planning, modeling, and tracking of
intermediate and final results throughout the program life cycle. Individual projects
deliver results that contribute to or enable the other projects in the program to proceed,
as well as contributing to the delivery of the overall program’s expected benefits.
Within organizations that have implemented portfolio management, the expected
benefits will normally be formalized at the portfolio level before being delegated to
the program for realization.
Benefits Management:
● Assesses the value and organizational impact of the program
● Identifies the interdependencies of benefits being delivered among various projects
within the program
● Ensu res tha t ta rge ted bene f i ts a re spec i f ic , measu rab le , ac tua l , rea l ist ic , and
time-based
● Analyzes the potential impact of planned program changes on benefits outcome
● Assigns responsibilities and accountability for the actual benefits required from
the program.

Benefits can be tangible or intangible. Tangible benefits are quantifiable and may
relate to financial objectives. Intangible benefits (e.g., improved employee morale or
customer satisfaction) are less easily quantified, however, most intangible benefits
ultimately contribute to a tangible benefit (e.g., increased participation in an event or
increased revenue results).
Benefits management begins in the early phases of a program’s life cycle. The
benefits realization plan, drafted early and maintained throughout all phases of a
program, includes:
● Definition of each benefit and how it is to be realized
● Mapping of benefits to program outcomes
● Metrics and procedures to measure benefits
● Roles and responsibilities for benefit management
● Communications plan for benefits management
● Transition of the program into ongoing operations and benefit sustainment.

Benefits management ensures that the organization will realize and sustain the
benefits from its investment in the program, even following the conclusion of the
program life cycle. The program manager must see that the program transition activi-
ties provide for continued management of program benefits within the framework of
ongoing operations.
The strategic planning and portfolio management processes, which identify and
evaluate benefits for the organization as a whole, provide the program with a definition
of the expected outcomes and resulting benefits. Figure 1-5 depicts an example of a
benefits management approach that spans the program life cycle and beyond into
transfer and sustainment of the benefits.

Figure 1-5. Illustrative Benefits Management Approach

1.7.2 Program Stakeholder Management

The second theme defines program stakeholders as individuals and organizations
whose interests may be affected by the program outcomes, either positively or nega-
tively. These stakeholders play a critical role in the success of any project or program.
Stakeholders of a program can be internal or external to the organization. Within an
organization, internal stakeholders cover all levels of the organization’s hierarchy.
Many stakeholders provide valuable input. Stakeholders also have the ability to influ-
ence programs— they can either help or hinder depending on the benefits or threats
they see. The program manager must understand the position stakeholders may take,
the way they may exert their influence, and their source of power. Where negative
influence is possible, the program manager needs to ensure that the stakeholders see
the benefits; something akin to marketing is often needed.
Key program stakeholders include:
● Program Director. The individual with executive ownership of the program or pro-
grams.
● Program Manager. The individual responsible for managing the program.
● Project Managers. The individuals responsible for managing the individual projects
within the program.
● Program Sponsor. The individual or group who champions the program initiative,
and is responsible for providing project resources and often ultimately for delivering
the benefits.
● Customer. The individual or organization that will use the new capabilities/results
of the program and derive the anticipated benefits.
● Performing Organization. The group that is performing the work of the program
through projects.
● Program Team Members. The individuals performing program activities.
● Project Team Members. The individuals performing constituent project activities.
● Program Management Office (PMO). The organization responsible for defining and
managing the program-related governance processes, procedures, and templates,
etc.
● Program Office. The organization that provides support of individual program
management teams or program managers by handling administrative functions cen-
trally.
● Program Governance Board. The group responsible for ensuring that program goals
are achieved and providing support for addressing program risks and issues.

89514$$CH1

04-05-06 17:42:23

Additional stakeholders may exist within the organization or external to it. Some
examples of external stakeholders include:
● Suppliers affected by changing policies and procedures
● Governmental regulatory agencies imposing new policies
● Competitors and potential customers with an interest in the program
● Groups representing consumer, environmental, or other interests.

Stakeholders may also include individuals and groups who are not directly affected
by the results of the program but maintain an interest in the initiative. Groups or
individuals who are competing for limited resources or pursuing goals which conflict
with those of the program should also be considered as stakeholders, since they can
affect the program results.
Program stakeholder management identifies how the program will affect stakehold-
ers (e.g., the organization’s culture, current major issues, resistance or barriers to
change, etc.) and then develops a communication strategy to engage the affected
stakeholders, manage their expectations, and improve their acceptance of the objec-
tives of the program.
Program stakeholder management extends beyond project stakeholder manage-
ment to consider additional levels of stakeholders resulting from broader interdepen-
dencies among projects. A stakeholder management plan, combined with the commu-
nication plan, should deliver accurate, consistent, and timely information that reaches
all relevant stakeholders as part of the communication process to facilitate a clear
understanding of the issues. Communication planning and execution should focus
on the proactive and targeted development and delivery of key messages, and engage-
ment of key stakeholders at the right time and in the right manner.
Stakeholder management is also an important factor in implementing successful
organizational change. In this context, program plans should clearly show an under-
standing of and integration with generally accepted methods of organizational change
management. This includes identifying the key individuals who have an interest in or
will be affected by the changes and ensuring they are aware of, supportive of, and
part of the change process. To facilitate the change process, the program manager
must communicate to stakeholders a clear vision of the need for change, as well as
the initiative’s specific objectives and the resources required. The program manager
must also set clear goals, assess readiness, plan for the change, provide resources/
support, monitor the change, obtain and evaluate feedback from those affected by
the change, and address issues with people who are not fully embracing the change.

1.7.3 Program Governance

The third theme, program governance, is the process of developing, communicating,
implementing, monitoring, and assuring the policies, procedures, organizational struc-
tures, and practices associated with a given program. The result is a framework for
efficient and effective decision-making and delivery management focused on achieving
program goals in a consistent manner, addressing appropriate risks and stakeholder
requirements.
The organization’s management team will want to ensure that program governance
fits within the wider governance of the organization (e.g., corporate governance). As
depicted in Figure 1-6, governance includes constraints and guidance offered by strate-
gic management, related practices such as portfolio and project management, and
the processes and structures that drive, monitor, and constrain the operations of the

12

organization. A program board is a formal way to capture this executive need and
forms a community or forum where the issues of the program can be managed.
Although not all organizations can formalize such a structure, the practices as laid
out below are common in response to the needs of program management. The program
board is the group responsible for the governance of their specific program, and
should be aware of any cross-program governance directives. The program board
exists throughout the life of the program. The program board is sometimes referred
to as the governance board or steering committee.

Figure 1-6. Governance Context

Program governance is concerned with controlling the organization’s investment
as well as monitoring the delivery of benefits as the program progresses. This control
is achieved by monitoring progress reports and reviews on a routine basis and specifi-
cally at each phase in the program’s life cycle. These reviews are an opportunity for
senior management or their representatives to assess the performance of the program
before allowing the program to move to the next phase or before the initiation of
another project within the program. These reviews are discussed in Chapter 2, Section
2.2.3 (Program Governance Through Phase-Gate Reviews). Figure 1-7 displays the
organizational view of a possible governance structure.

89514$$CH1

04-05-06 17:42:23

Figure 1-7. Program Governance Structure

The program board, representing the interests of the organization, provides the
overarching governance and quality assurance of the program. The composition of
the program board is typically a cross-functional group of senior stakeholders responsi-
ble for providing guidance and decisions regarding program direction and changes
affecting the program outcomes.
Specific functions of the board include, but are not limited to, the following:
● Initiation of the program
● Approval of program plans and authorizing deviations from the plans
● Review of the program’s progress, benefits delivery, and costs
● Guidance on issues that the program manager has been unable to resolve
● Assurance that resources are available for the program
● Collection of input for strategic progress reporting
● Establishment of frameworks and limits for making decisions about investments in
the program
● Compliance with corporate and legal policies, procedures, standards, and require-
ments.

The program board is not usually a consensus committee; the executive sponsor
is the key decision maker taking advice and commitments from others within the
board and program management team. Each member of the board represents key
internal stakeholders and may potentially include those external to the organization
impacted by the program’s outcomes.
The program board members do not work full time on the program; therefore, they
place great reliance on the program management team.
The organization may choose to set up a program management office (PMO) with
the responsibility of defining and managing the specific program-related governance
processes, procedures, and templates etc., with which all programs must comply.

Organizations may then choose to have the program management office provide
support to all programs. Typically, the role of the program management office is to
support individual program management teams or program managers by handling
administrative functions centrally.
Figure 1-8 illustrates the hierarchy of governance and the deliverables that the roles
are expected to generate for the organization.

CHAPTER 2

Program Life Cycle and
Organization

As defined in Chapter 1, programs and program management exist within a strategic
context and operate as strategy implementation vehicles. The program manager must
understand this wider context to be able to adapt the life cycle model and program
benefits to satisfy the corresponding requirements assigned to the program.
This chapter describes some of the key life cycle considerations in the program
management context. The topics include:
2.1 Program Life Cycle
2.2 Program Themes Across the Program Life Cycle
2.3 Program Management Life Cycle Phases

2.1 Program Life Cycle

Organizations and their project managers recognize that current best practice in proj-
ect control involves breaking the project into discrete stages or phases. The manage-
ment of programs has the same requirement. To ensure effective program control,
the program moves through discrete, though often overlapping phases. These phases
facilitate program governance, enhanced control, and coordination of program and
project resources and overall risk management.
Program life cycles serve to manage outcomes and benefits, as contrasted with
project life cycles, which serve to produce deliverables. Project products deliver capa-
bilities to the organization, while the program manages and accrues the corresponding
benefits during the Delivering the Incremental Benefits phase as shown in Figure 2-
1 and explained in detail in Section 2.3.4. It should be noted that this is the phase in
which the main effort and time of the program are expended as the benefits are
progressively delivered. As such, it is of an iterative nature with internal links to project
and program governances. To ensure that the program delivers and tracks the expected
benefits, there is usually senior management oversight of a program by means of
phase-gate reviews as shown in Figure 2-2, in order to comply with program governance
as described in Section 1.7.3 in the previous chapter. In the context of a program,

some projects may produce benefits that can be realized immediately whereas other
projects may deliver capabilities that must be integrated with the capabilities delivered
by other projects before the associated benefits can be realized.

Figure 2-2. A Representative Program Life Cycle

The type of program being managed may influence a program’s life cycle; however,
the major life cycle phases and their deliverables will remain similar. An example of
this is pharmaceutical or medical device manufacturers who have to conduct extensive
clinical trials (projects) during and after a product has been developed. The regulators
for these industries also review the organization’s use of risk management to assess
potential flaws in their products. Each of these steps will normally be run as one or
more projects, or, if required, as a program.
The key distinctions between program and project life cycles are:
● Programs often have an extended life cycle as some projects transition to operations
while other projects are only just being initiated.
● Projects generate discrete deliverables at the completion of their life cycle, and the
resulting benefits subsequently flow into the program.
● The capabilities delivered by several of the program’s projects may need to be
integrated in order to provide some or all of the program’s benefits.

The PMBOK威 Guide—Third Edition addresses the use of a project life cycle to assist
in the control and management of the project deliverables. Within a program there
are several projects, each following its own project life cycle. In fact, each project
could use a different life cycle model, depending on the type of project. In such cases,
the program manager may define a project life cycle model to create a common
language among stakeholders and facilitate reporting and monitoring the status of all
projects within the program.
An example of this could be:

Table 2-1. Example of a Project Life Cycle Model

2.2 Program Themes Across the Program Life Cycle

As introduced in Chapter 1, three themes permeate all activities of a program: benefits
management, stakeholder management, and program governance . These themes
evolve over time and require a program manager’s focus throughout each phase of
the program’s life cycle.

2.2.1 Benefits Management and the Program Life Cycle

The program life cycle is designed not only to comply with the needs of corporate
governance, but also to ensure that the expected benefits are realized in a predictable
and coordinated manner. Benefits management requires the establishment of pro-
cesses and measures for tracking and assessing benefits throughout the program life
cycle. In fact, the management of program benefits has a life cycle of its own, which
runs parallel to that of the program. Benefits management evolves as the program
evolves through its phases. This relationship between program life cycle and the
benefits management life cycle is illustrated in Figure 2-3.
To be successful, benefits management must begin when the program is initiated,
in the Pre-Program Set Up and Program Set Up life cycle phases. There should be
clear definition and agreement among stakeholders on the factors contributing to
benefits, as well as a supporting structure and processes to help plan, manage, measure,
track, and realize the benefits. The benefits expected from each project should be
defined in the project business case before the project is initiated, together with the
benefit tracking and assessment processes.
The Program Management and Technical Infrastructure phases should be estab-
lished in such a way as to be capable of recording, tracking, and evaluating benefits
in accordance with the benefits definition and assessment processes defined in the
preceding phase.
During program end-of-phase reviews and at the Closing Program phase, benefits
management includes reporting planned versus actual benefits at the current point

in time as well as the forecast for their ongoing value, reasons for any deviations, and
recommendations on how gaps can be bridged.

2.2.2 Stakeholder Management

As described in Chapter 1 (Section 1.7.2), program stakeholder management must
carefully consider the interests and concerns of the often extensive stakeholder list in
order to ensure program success. Program stakeholder management is a required
function that starts with the identification and analysis of all stakeholders and spans
all the life cycle phases of a program.
Each stakeholder can play a significant role in the success of any program. For this
reason, the program management team must identify stakeholders early in the program
life cycle, and then actively manage stakeholder expectations throughout all of the
life cycle phases to ensure their continued support of the program.
In many instances, a change to the program environment can add or remove
stakeholders; the program manager must manage the stakeholder list throughout the
lifetime of the program and take appropriate actions to handle expected or actual
changes.

2.2.3 Program Governance Through Phase-Gate Reviews

Program governance, as explained in Section 1.7.3 of Chapter 1, focuses on the over-
sight of programs by a steering committee or governance board. The use of additional
tools, such as pre-defined milestones or phase-gate reviews, can complement the

20

governance structure. The use in this way of a formal program methodology constitutes
a generally accepted practice for applying governance through a program.
The phase-gate reviews are generally focused on strategic alignment, investment
appraisal, monitoring and control of opportunities and threats, benefit assessment,
and the monitoring of the program outcomes. In cases where the program was initiated
as part of a portfolio, these reviews will be carried out within the context of the
corresponding portfolio.
The phase-gate reviews, shown in Figure 2-2, are a recommended approach to
aiding program control and program management, as well as facilitating program
governance. Phase-gate reviews are carried out at key decision points in the program
life cycle. The purpose of phase-gate reviews is to provide an objective check against
the exit criteria of a completed phase to determine readiness to proceed to the next
phase in the program life cycle. Phase-gate reviews also provide an opportunity to
assess the program with respect to a number of strategic and quality-related criteria
including:
● Program and its constituent projects are still aligned with the organization’s strategy
● Expected benefits are in line with the original business plan
● Level of risk remains acceptable to the organization
● Identified generally accepted good practices are being followed.

Phase-gate reviews are often based upon the core investment decisions within the
life cycle. The focus of each phase-gate review is specific to the phase just completed
by the program. Each phase-gate review functions as a ‘‘go’’ or ‘‘no-go’’ decision point
on the program as a whole. In the case of phase-gate G5, shown throughout the
graphics here, it is a convention to indicate confirmation of program closure.
Phase-gate reviews do not substitute for periodic program performance reviews
that assess performance against expected outcomes and against the need to realize
and sustain program benefits into the long term.

2.3 Program Management Life Cycle Phases

This section defines the phases of the generic life cycle introduced in Figure 2-2. These
phases will apply to most programs most of the time. Between the phases are pre-
defined milestones or phase-gate reviews, as introduced in the previous section. The
gate numbers shown correspond to the five previously mentioned gates.

2.3.1 Program Governance Across the Life Cycle

While it is not, strictly speaking, a phase in the program management life cycle, this
process spans all of the program life cycle phases. Program governance—using the
governance mechanisms identified in Sections 1.7.3 on Program Governance and 2.2.3
on Governance through phase-gate review—monitors the progress of the program
and the delivery of the coordinated benefits from its component projects.
Program governance provides an appropriate organizational structure and the poli-
cies and procedures to support program delivery through formal program reviews
facilitated by the regular and phase-gate-based oversight of deliverables, performance,
risks, and issues by the program board.
Program governance is fulfilled through the following roles:
● Executive Sponsor. Responsible for creating an environment that will ensure pro-
gram success
● Program Director. Possesses executive ownership of the program policies

Figure 2-4. Program Governance

● Program Board or Steering Committee. Empowered to make decisions regarding
program scope, budget, and schedules and to resolve escalated issues and risks
● Program Manager. Supported by any associated program office and responsible
for conducting appropriate program management activities, as outlined in Chapter 3
● Project Managers. Responsible for providing accurate and timely status reports and
for reporting and escalating risks and issues as they are identified.

Program governance activities are conducted through all phases of the program
life cycle and require organizations to establish and enforce policies that address
the following:
● Common procedures for all projects within the program
● Appropriate controls to ensure consistent application of procedures
● Approach for developing and documenting program assumptions and decisions
● Approach for managing program change
● Quantifiable measures for evaluating the success of individual projects and the
program
● Common practices for capturing risks, issues, benefit measurements, and lessons
learned.

These policies are most often created by the program office with input from the
steering committee and project teams. The policies provide a framework for all pro-
gram activities.
Phase-gate reviews provide an opportunity for senior management to ensure the
initiative remains viable and continues to support the organization’s strategy. These
reviews can also provide an opportunity for senior management to review critical
program risks and issues. At each phase-gate review, the program may be approved
to go forward to the next phase or may be cancelled. Additional review gates can be
defined during the longest phase of the program, the delivering the incremental bene-
fits phase, to monitor the progress of the constituent projects.

2.3.2 Phase One: Pre-Program Set Up

The primary objective of the Pre-Program Set Up phase is to establish a firm foundation
of support and approval for the program.
In program and project management life cycles, there is a business-based selection
process that determines whether an organization will approve a program/project. A
strategic decision-making body in the form of a program board, portfolio management

22

©2006 Project Management Institute, Four Campus Boulevard, Newtown Square, PA 19073-3299 USA

89514$$CH2

group or executive sponsor of the program (usually a senior executive or portfolio
manager) initiates the program with a mandate or program brief detailing the strategic
objectives and benefits that the program is expected to deliver. This selection process
may range from a very informal one to a more formal, standardized approach. As shown
in OPM3威, the more mature an organization is in terms of program management, the
more likely it is to have a formalized selection process.

Figure 2-5. Pre-Program Set Up

The pre-program set up phase focuses on the preparation and navigation through
the selection process and typically consists of several activities:
● Understanding the strategic value of the proposed business change
● Identifying the key decision makers/stakeholders in the program selection process
and their expectations and interests
● Defining the program objectives and their alignment with the organization’s strate-
gic objectives
● Developing a high-level business case demonstrating an understanding of the needs,
feasibility and justification of the program
● Securing approval for the program charter by getting signatures of the key stake-
holders
● Appointing the program manager by the program board
● Developing a plan to initiate the program.

Program management provides a focused effort to achieve the strategic objectives
of the organization. Programs are more strategic in nature than projects. As a result,
in the Pre-Program Set Up phase, there is a significant need to show how the program
would map to and deliver the strategic objectives through alignment of its constituent
projects. Programs are generally undertaken by organizations as a catalyst for some
level of change. In this case, program plans should clearly show an understanding of
and integration with generally accepted methods of organizational change manage-
ment.
During this phase, the program manager or executive sponsor also needs to consider
and answer the question of why the expected business benefits would be best realized
through a program rather than a project. There should be a clear indication of the
type of program being recommended and the criteria used to arrive at the recommen-
dation. The rationale used could include considerations as:
● Shared resources across projects
● Program duration
● Participation across corporate entities
● Dependencies on deliverables between projects to create a set of benefits.
The stakeholders at this stage are:

23

● Those who are in a position to influence the selection of the program for approval or
● Those who are in a position to influence the success of the program if it is selected
(i.e., those impacted by the results of the program).

The information required, and the orientation of the selection committee, may be
significantly different from those of the stakeholders who will eventually benefit from
the program. This fact may have an impact on the analysis and documentation required
at this phase.
Once the strategic area to be addressed is clearly understood, and the stakeholders
w ith whom commun icat ion must be establ ished are identified , then a high-level
approach or plan needs to be developed. This plan must show that the program
manager clearly understands the stimuli that triggered the program, the program
objectives, and how the objectives align to the organization. The high-level plan should
include a clear statement of the following program components:
● Mission—why the program is important and what it needs to achieve
● Vision—what the end state will look like, how it will benefit the organization
● Values—how the program will evaluate necessary tradeoffs and balance the deci-
sions to be made.

The selection criteria and materials to be provided may range from vague and
informal to very detailed, specific, and formal. Typically, the following factors are
considered in selecting and approving programs:
● Total available resources (i.e., funding, equipment or people)
● Preliminary budget estimates required for this program
● Benefits analysis, which identifies and plans for their realization
● Strategic fit within the organization’s long-term goals
● Risks inherent in this program.
The results from this stage of the life cycle are:
● Approval from a governing board to proceed to the next phase
● Program charter that documents the vision, key objectives, expected benefits, con-
straints of the program, and any assumptions to be used for planning (key input)
● Assigned program manager
● Identification and commitment of key resources needed for planning
● A plan for the program set up phase.

2.3.3 Phase Two: Program Set Up

At this stage, the program has passed the first phase-gate review (G1) and has received
‘‘approval in principle’’ from a selection committee to proceed to program set up. A
program manager has been identified and the key input into this phase—a charter
defining high-level scope, objectives, visions, and constraints—has been generated.
The purpose of the Program Set Up phase is to continue to develop the foundation
for the program by now building a detailed ‘‘roadmap’’ that provides direction on
how the program will be managed and defines its key deliverables.
The desired outcome of this phase is approval authorizing execution of the program
management plan. To achieve that outcome, the detailed program management plan
contains answers to the following questions:
● What are the deliverables and when will they be ready?
● How much will it cost?
● What are the risks and issues?
● What dependencies, assumptions, and constraints are included?
● How will the program be managed/executed?

Figure 2-6. Program Set Up

If the program’s components have not already been defined, this phase will deter-
mine the components that need to be included with the program, as well as any
feasibility studies that may need to be conducted to address program issues. Activities
in this second phase could include:
● Aligning the mission, vision, and values for the program with the organization’s
objectives
● Developing an initial detailed cost and schedule plan for setting up the program
and outline plans for the remainder of the program
● Conducting feasibility studies, where applicable, to assess the proposed program
for technical and economic feasibility, as well as ethical feasibility or acceptability
● Establishing rules for make/buy decisions as well as those for selecting subcontrac-
tors to support the program
● Developing a program architecture that maps out how the projects within the
program will deliver the capabilities that result in the required benefits
● Developing a business case for each project in the program which addresses the
techn ica l , investment and regu la to ry/ leg is la t ive factors wh ich may per ta in to
each project
● Communicating with stakeholders and getting support.

Key results from this stage of the life cycle revolve around the program-level Planning
Processes and include:
● Scope definition and planning
● Activity definition and sequencing
● Duration estimates
● Schedule
● Procurement of external resources
● Internal/external resources/staffing allocation
● Cost estimates/budgeting
● Risk management consolidation
● Constituent component identification and definition
● Approval of the program management plan, based upon the individual business
cases and supporting feasibility studies
● Identification of preliminary program team.

2.3.4 Phase Three: Establish Program Management and Technical
Infrastructure

The purpose of this phase is to establish an infrastructure that will support the program
and its constituent projects as they deliver the expected benefits for the program.

Figure 2-7. Establish the Program Infrastructure

Once the program has passed the second phase-gate review (G2), the program
manager has a mandate to execute the program as defined by its roadmap, subject
to organizational boundaries beyond which the program manager would need to
reaffirm/ realign the program. In this phase, the program manager and the program
team need to establish the structure in which work will occur along with the technical
infrastructure to facilitate that work. More so than projects, programs usually have a
supporting infrastructure in place, including the following:
● Program-specific governance areas such as processes and procedures
● Program-specific tools such as Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP), program track-
ing tools, time/expense reporting, software development tools, benefit measure-
ment, monitoring and tracking, etc.
● Program facilities.

The program requires an organization to support the controlling and monitoring
of the program and its projects and to make decisions for the program. The program
organizational structure typically consists of:
● Program Board. Representing the interests of the organization, possibly supported
by a Program Management Office that is responsible for managing cross-program
governance.
● Program Manager. Representing the program team, including the corresponding
project managers, possibly supported by a Program Office to assist the program
manager in cross-project governance.
The key roles within this structure are:
● Executive Sponsor. Has primary responsibility to the business for delivery of benefits
and who sits with the program board to make business decisions about the program.
● Program Director. Has executive ownership of the program. The program director
and executive sponsor could be the same person.
● Program Manager. Responsible for managing and representing the program.
● Program Team. Responsible to develop program-level benefits.
● Program Office. Supports the program manager and program team.

89514$$CH2

04-11-06 14:15:27

The program structure and the relationships within the structure are defined in the
program framework and customized in the program charter and plan. The key results
from this phase include:
● Program team staffing
● Program office to support the program
● Program governance mechanism with approval and reporting procedures
● Program control framework for monitoring and controlling both the projects and
the measurement of benefits within the program
● Facilities and other required infrastructure to support the program
● IT systems and communication technologies with the necessary support arrange-
ments to sustain the program throughout its life cycle.

2.3.5 Phase Four: Deliver the Benefits

The purpose of this phase is to initiate the component projects of the program and
coordinate the deliverables to create the incremental benefits.

Figure 2-8. Deliver the Benefits

At this point in the program’s life cycle, the program has passed another phase-gate
review (G3) and the core work of the program—through its components—begins. This
phase is therefore iterative and can be of unlimited duration, since the activities described
below are repeated as often as required and the benefits are achieved in a cumulative
manner. The phase ends only when the planned benefits of the program have been
achieved or a decision is made to terminate the program for any other reason.
The program management team is responsible for managing this group of related
projects in a consistent and coordinated way in order to achieve incremental benefits
that could not be obtained by managing the projects as stand-alone efforts. The
following activities are performed during this phase:
● Establishing a project governance structure to monitor and control the projects
● Initiating projects in order to meet program objectives
● Managing the transition from the ‘‘as-is’’ state to the ‘‘to-be’’ or target state
● Ensuring project managers adhere to established project management methodolo-
gies
● Ensuring project deliverables meet their business/technical requirements
● Analyzing progress to plan
● Identifying environmental changes which may impact the program management
plan or anticipated benefits
● Ensuring that common activities and dependencies between projects or other pro-
grams in the portfolio are coordinated
● Identifying risks and ensuring appropriate mitigation actions have been taken

● Identifying issues and ensuring corrective actions are taken
● Coordinating the efficient use of resources across the program and project activities
● Reviewing change requests and authorizing additional work as appropriate
● Setting thresholds for corrective action when realized benefits are not delivered per
expectations
● Communicating with stakeholders and the program governance board.

The program manager or, for larger programs, the program management office
reviews the efforts by the constituent project teams. It will be up to the program
manager/PMO to determine the key intersections and critical interfaces of the project
and the program.

2.3.6 Phase Five: Close the Program

The purpose of this phase is to execute a controlled closedown of the program.

Figure 2-9. Close the Program

The last phase of a program begins after a phase-gate review (G4). All program
work is completed and benefits are accruing. The activities in this phase lead to the
shut down of the program organization and infrastructure as well as the transition of
artifacts, benefits monitoring, and on-going operations to other groups.
There are key activities that must be executed when a program arrives at the end
of its life cycle to ensure that the closure is smooth and safe.
● Review status of benefits with the stakeholders and program sponsor.
● Disband the program organization.
● Disband the program team; ensure arrangements are in place for appropriate re-
deployment of all human resources.
● Dismantle the infrastructure; ensure arrangements are in place for appropriate
redeployment of all physical resources (e.g., facilities, equipment, etc.).
● Provide customer support assuring that guidance and maintenance will be provided
in the case that an issue arises or a defect is detected after the release; this assurance
is generally defined by contract.
● Document lessons learned in the organizational database so they can be referenced
in the future by similar programs. Lessons learned are generally expressed as weak-
nesses or areas to improve and as strengths and best practices of the performing
organization to be utilized in the future.
● Provide feedback and recommendations on changes identified during the program’s
life but beyond the scope of the program that may benefit the organization to pursue.
● Store and index all program-related documents to facilitate reuse in the future.
● Manage any required transition to operations.

Program Management Processes

Program management is the centralized coordinated management of a program to
achieve the program’s strategic objectives and benefits. Good program management
requires visionary, entrepreneurial, and motivational zeal, combined with sound man-
agement processes.
The process definitions and terminology at the program level are very similar to
the processes at the project level. However, program management processes address
issues at a higher level and involve less detailed project-level analysis. The program
level is configured to resolve issues between projects and to enable a synergistic
approach, so as to deliver program benefits. Like project management processes,
program management processes require coordination with other functional groups
in th e o r g an i z a t i on a s w e l l a s s t a k e h o l d e r m a n a g em e n t in g e n e r a l — bu t i n a
broader context.
A guiding rule for applying program management processes is to ensure that the
program manager effectively delegates authority, autonomy, and responsibility for
day-to-day management of the projects to the designated project managers.
Program management processes are primarily integrative in that they coordinate
the outputs of various projects to derive the desired program outcomes. For this
reason, the program management processes can be mapped in terms of the various
Knowledge Areas outlined in the PMBOK威 Guide—Third Edition. This mapping is
described in Section 3.10.

3.1 Themes in the Program Management Life Cycle

In Chapter 1 of this standard, three major themes in program management are identi-
fied and described. In this chapter, the processes that support the themes are described.

3.1.1 Benefits Management

Benefits management is one of the three major themes in program management, since
programs are created to produce benefits that would not otherwise be realized. Benefits
management assesses the value and organizational impact of the program’s benefits,
identifies the interdependencies of benefits being delivered among various projects
within the program, and assigns responsibilities and accountability for the actual
realization of benefits from the program.
A benefits realization plan is a critical component of the Initiate Program Process
that includes: intended interdependencies between benefits, alignment with the strate-
gic goals of the organization, benefit delivery scheduling, metrics and measurement,
responsibility for delivery of the final and intermediate benefits within the program,
and benef it rea l izat ion . The interdependenc ies , benef it de l ivery schedu ling , and
responsibility for delivery, lie within the program management domain.
Expected benefits should be defined in the business case on which the program is
based. The benefits realization plan for the program is based on this information and
is the main output from the Initiate Program Process. In this case, where the program
is launched as a component of a portfolio, the benefits realization plan should be
available from the portfolio management domain or a strategic planning function.
This plan is the basis for the program management plan and helps to determine how
benefits will subsequently be realized, and provides a baseline for tracking progress
and reporting any variances.

3.1.2 Stakeholder Management

As stated in Chapter 1, stakeholders play a critical role in the success of the program.
This role is recognized and addressed throughout the processes defined in this chapter.
The program stakeholders’ expectations need to be taken into account and managed
in all of the Program Management Process Groups from initiation through closure. A
stakeholder analysis and management plan needs to be produced as the program is
being initiated.

3.1.3 Program Governance

Chapter 2 of this standard provides the life cycle focus on program governance, whereas
Chapter 3 establishes the processes by which program governance is implemented.
Program governance is a combination of the activities of a program board, or other
entity with oversight of the program, and the program manager and program team, who
accomplish program governance by means of the program management processes.
The processes of program management and their outputs and results are necessary
for governance to occur, but program governance itself operates in a manner external
to the program. Governance controls the program, and therefore bridges the program
life cycle and the program management processes.

3.2 Program Management Process Groups

This section identifies and describes the five Program Management Process Groups.
These Process Groups align to those defined in the PMBOK威 Guide—Third Edition
and are independent of application areas or industry focus.
These Process Groups are not linear and do overlap. Interaction occurs both within
a Process Group and between Process Groups. It is important to note that these Process
Groups do not bear any direct relationship to phases of a program life cycle. In fact,
one or more processes from each Process Group will normally be executed at least
once in every phase of a program life cycle. The five Program Management Process
Groups are briefly discussed below:
● Initiating Process Group. Defines and authorizes the program or a project within
the program and produces the program benefits statement and benefits realization
plan for the program.
● Planning Process Group. Plans the best alternative courses of action to deliver the
benefits and scope that the program was undertaken to address.
● Executing Process Group. Integrates projects, people, and other resources to carry
out the plan for the program and deliver the program’s benefits.
● Monitoring and Controlling Process Group. Requires that the program and its
component projects be monitored against the benefit delivery expectations and
that their progress be regularly measured, to identify variances from the program
management plan. This Process Group also coordinates corrective actions to be
taken, when necessary, to achieve program benefits.
● Closing Process Group. Formalizes acceptance of a product, service, or benefit/
result; brings the program or program component (e.g., project) to an orderly end.

3.3 Common Program Management Process Components

Each of the program management processes may have components (inputs, outputs,
and tools and techniques) that are unique to that process, but there are also compo-
nents that are common to many processes throughout the Program Management
Process Groups. Among these are inputs and outputs such as assumptions, constraints,
historical information, lessons learned and supporting details, and controls such as
policies, procedures, and reviews.
Instead of repeating these components in many process descriptions, they have
been described and explained below in terms of how they apply to the program
management process approach in general.

3.3.1 Inputs Common to Program Management Processes

There are a number of inputs that are common to most program management pro-
cesses. Generally, the common inputs fall into a category that can be considered
common knowledge within the organization. For example, assumptions or constraints
could be inputs to almost any process. Some of the inputs common to many program
management processes are presented below. In addition, others can be identified and
observed while studying the program management processes.

.1 Assumptions (Input and Output)
Assumptions are factors that, for planning purposes, are considered true, real,
or certain. Assumptions affect all aspects of program planning and are part of
the progressive elaboration of the program. Program teams frequently identify,
document and validate assumptions as part of their planning. Due to their
uncertainty, assumptions generally involve a degree of risk.

.2 Constraints (Input)
Constraints are factors that limit the program team’s options. They are factors
external to the program that will limit the flexibility of the program manager.
Constraints generally fall in the categories of time, cost, resources, or specific
deliverables.

.3 Historical Information (Input)
Previous programs can be a source of lessons learned and best practices for a
new program. This is particularly true for programs where a substantial amount
of work is done by virtual means or when the work involves multicultural interac-
tion. Historical information includes all artifacts, metrics, risks, and estimations
from previous programs and projects that are pertinent to the current program.
Historical information describing the successes, failures and lessons learned on
past programs with respect to integrating multiple projects is especially impor-
tant to program planning and management.

.4 Organizational Process Assets (Input)
Organizational process assets, sometimes called a Process Asset Library (PAL),
are composed of a set of formal and informal program management process-
related plans, policies, procedures, and guidelines that are developed, docu-
mented, and institutionalized by the organization. These assets may also include
an organization’s knowledge bases, such as lessons learned and historical infor-
mation. Assets may exist as paper documents or in electronic form in an auto-
mated repository.

3.3.2 Outputs Common to Program Management Processes

There are also a number of outputs which are common among the processes. For
example, assumptions and lessons learned could be outputs from almost any process.
Some of the outputs common to many program management processes are presented
below. In addition, others can be identified and observed while studying the program
management processes.

.1 Lessons Learned (Output)
Lessons learned include causes of variances from the program management
plan, corrective actions taken and their outcomes, risk mitigations and other
information of value to management and stakeholders of future programs. Les-
sons learned should be identified and documented throughout the program
management processes, and flow to the Close Program Process for analysis
and archiving.

.2 Supporting Details (Output)
Supporting details vary by process and program size. Supporting details consist
of documentation and information not included in formal program artifacts but
deemed necessary to the successful management of the program.

.3 Information Requests (Output)
Requests for information on various aspects of a program are initiated continu-
ously and frequently by the program’s external and internal stakeholders and
are outputs from many of its program management processes. Information
requests flow to the Information Distribution Process, which creates the appro-
priate responses as outputs.

3.4 Initiating Process Group

Initiation of a program occurs as the result of a strategic plan, a strategic initiative to
fulfill an initiative within a portfolio, or as the result of a decision to bid for a contract
from an external customer. There may be a number of activities performed before the
Initiate Program Process, resulting in the development of concepts (for products or
services), scope frameworks, initial requirements, timelines, deliverables, and guide-
lines as to acceptable costs.
Program funding is required to support the program through the initiation and
planning phases until cost and budget estimating is complete. Significant resources
can be required for these early activities.

Figure 3-1. Initiating Process Group

3.4.1 Initiate Program

Often the starting point for a program is an organizational concept for a future state
to fit in with a future organizational environment. Initially, this concept may be inade-
quately defined and the purpose of Initiate Program is to provide a process that helps
define the scope and benefit expectations of the program. Initiate Program also ensures
that authorization and initiation of the program are linked to the organization’s ongo-
ing work and strategic priorities.
Candidates for program status include project work as well as non-project work,
such as new investments and ongoing operations. Initiating a program can entail
configuring or grouping proposed projects and existing projects into a program based
on specific benefit delivery or other criteria. Initiate Program also requires formal
acceptance of the program scope from the stakeholders. Such acceptance acknowl-

35

89514$$CH3

04-11-06 12:26:54

edges the necessity of the program as a way to achieve the desired portfolio or strategic
benefits. Formal acceptance usually means each stakeholder signs off on the scope
document.
Initiate Program generally calls for order-of-magnitude estimates of scope, effort,
and cost. Such estimates are often called feasibility studies or concept development.
A feasibility study may or may not occur before a formal initiation of a program.
This will depend on the culture of the organization and the type of program under
consideration. In either case, the results of the activities are used as inputs to one or
more of the Initiating and Planning Processes.
The Initiate Program Process takes into account the organization’s strategic plan
and its business needs, as documented in a business case and investment analysis,
which are developed externally to the program domain. The business case and invest-
ment analysis, then define the way in which those business needs will be achieved.
Programs are typically chartered and authorized by an organizational executive
committee, steering committee, or a portfolio management body. Key outputs of this
process include the program charter and preliminary scope statement. The program
charter links the program to the ongoing work of the organization. The charter often
contains the vision statement that defines the desired organizational end state to
follow for successful completion of the program, and is used as the vehicle to authorize
the program. The preliminary scope statement includes objectives and high-level
deliverables of the program.

Table 3-1. Initiate Program: Inputs and Outputs

3.4.2 Authorize Projects

Authorize Projects is the process of performing the program management activities
to initiate a component within the program. This process can occur during any program
phase except closing. The timing to initiate a project is usually controlled by the
program management plan. In some cases, the program team may discover the need
to initiate a project that was not previously planned.
The Authorize Projects Process at the program level includes:
● Developing a business case that will secure funding for and allocating budget to
the project
● Ensuring that a project manager is assigned
● Communicating project-related information to the stakeholders

04-11-06 12:26:54

● Initiating a governance structure that will monitor and track benefit delivery and
progress of the project at the program level.

In some cases, the program manager will be the sponsor for the project.
Authorize Projects may trigger the redeployment of human and other resources
from one project or activity to another. This is managed at the program level and may
require other program process activity if the managers of the releasing project are
unable or unwilling to release the resources required. Finally, all program-level docu-
mentation and records dealing with the project must be updated to reflect the new
status of the projects in question.

Table 3-2. Authorize Projects: Inputs and Outputs

3.4.3 Initiate Team

The Initiate Team Process gets needed human resources assigned to and working on
the program. The program management team is responsible for ensuring that the
human resources selected will be able to achieve the program requirements. This
responsibility typically involves designating personnel from within the organization
to be assigned to the program team. However, other human resources may be obtained
to augment the program, through recruiting new employees, retaining consulting staff
to support the program or incorporating human resources from subcontractors and
teaming partners.
Initiate Team commences in conjunction with the Initiate Program Process and kick-
off meeting. The objective is to formalize the appointment of the program manager by
the program sponsor and to put in place the key personnel who will comprise the
core program team. At this point in the program life cycle, the role of the program
manager and core program team is to accomplish the tasks necessary to position the
program to commence the Planning Processes. Some members of the core program
team may be assigned to the program only to participate in the initiation or start-up
of the program and may be replaced by permanent staff during the Resource Planning
and Acquire Program Team Processes.

3.5 Planning Process Group

The Planning Process Group contains the processes needed to lay the groundwork
for the program and position it for successful execution. These processes involve
formalizing the scope of the work to be accomplished by the program and identifying
the deliverables that will satisfy the program’s goals and deliver its benefits.
The key program-level deliverable that is created by the Planning Processes is the
program management plan, which defines the tactical means by which the program
will be carried out. Included in the program management plan, either as components
within the document or as subsidiary plans, are the plans that drive the basic elements
of managing the program. These plans include and address:
● Organization of the program
● Program work breakdown structure (PWBS) that formalizes the program scope in
terms of deliverables and the work needed to produce those deliverables/benefits
via the projects
● Internal and external resources required for performing the work defined in the
PWBS
● All aspects of scope, technology, risks and costs
● Program schedule that establishes the timeline for program milestones and delivera-
bles
● Program budget that defines the monetary plan for the program in terms of outlays
of funds over the program life cycle and the purposes to which those funds will
be applied
● Means by which the required quality of the program deliverables will be assured
● Plans for defining metrics and systems to track benefit delivery, realization and
sustainment
● Communications with stakeholders both internal and external to the program
● Approach and methodology to be followed to manage risks associated with the program
● Procurement management plan created during the first iteration of the Plan Program
Purchases and Acquisitions Process, and then updated as needed while performing
the Executing Processes.
● Plans for procurement of facilities, goods, services and other external resources needed
to accomplish the program, and to manage contractual vehicles for procurement
● Interrelationships between projects and non-pro ject tasks w ithin the program,
between the program and its projects or with factors external to the program.

The Program Planning Processes are iterative and are dependent upon information
generated at the project level. During this iterative process, a combination of top-down
and bottom-up approaches may be the most suitable. Re-planning is also required
at points in the program’s performance when scope changes or other unplanned
circumstances dictate the need.
Interactions among the processes within the Planning Process Group can vary based
on the nature and complexity of the program. The activities of the Planning Process
Group include interaction with the portfolio domain.
Planning is performed in the early phase of a program. However, because of both
the extended length and the multi-project nature of programs, there are additional
milestones where plans should be revisited and updated to ensure ongoing usefulness.
These milestones include, but are not limited to:
● New project initiation
● Project closure
● Organization’s fiscal year and the budget planning cycle for the program
● Unplanned events that should trigger a review of plans, such as acquisitions and
mergers and other major organizational changes
● The output of either the Risk Monitoring and Control Process or the Issue Manage-
ment and Control Process, when an event sufficiently affects the program, rendering
current plans inadequate or ineffective.

3.5.1 Develop Program Management Plan

Develop Program Management Plan is the process of consolidating the outputs of the
other Planning Processes, including strategic planning, to create a consistent, coherent
set of documents that can be used to guide both program execution and program
control. This set of plans includes the following subsidiary plans:
● Benefits management plan
● Communications management plan
● Cost management plan
● Contracts management plan
● Interface management plan
● Scope management plan
● Procurement management plan
● Quality management plan
● Resource management plan
● Risk response plan
● Schedule management plan
● Staffing management plan.

Develop Program Management Plan is an iterative process (along with all of the
other Planning Processes), as competing priorities, assumptions, and constraints are
worked and resolved to address critical factors, such as business goals, deliverables,
benefits, time, and cost.
Each of the other Planning Processes in the program Planning Process Group pro-
duces, at a minimum, a plan addressing a specific aspect of the program, such as
communications or risks, and a set of supporting documents and detail. These other
plans may be incorporated into the program management plan or they may serve as
subsidiary plans to the program management plan.

3.5.2 Interface Planning

Interface Planning is the process of identifying and mapping interrelationships that
exist within a program with other programs in active portfolios or with factors outside
the program. It involves describing the characteristics of these interfaces and creating
the plan to ensure that these interfaces are established and maintained.
Often, representatives from all involved organizations comprise an integrated pro-
gram team. Both internal and external interfaces must be addressed. Primarily, inter-
face plans will identify interdependencies; however, they will also support the program
communications plan to set up formal communications channels and decision-making
relationships.
Whereas the staffing management plan must support the required interfaces in an
efficient manner, the interface management plan must take into account existing
organizational structures. The risks involved with these interrelationships need to be
identified during all phases of program management. This process is typically executed
in conjunction with the Human Resource Planning and Communications Planning
Processes.

3.5.3 Transition Planning

Transition Planning is the process of identifying and planning for transitions from the
program team to the recipients of on-going activities that result from the program.
Typically, transitions are a formal handoff of control of the product, service or benefit/
result produced by the program. The purpose of Transition Planning is to ensure that
program benefits are sustained once they are transferred to the organization.
Delivered with the transition are all pertinent documents, training and materials,
and supporting systems, facilities, and personnel. Transition Planning ensures that
the scope of the transition is defined, the stakeholders in the receiving organizations
or functions are identified to participate in the planning, the program benefits are
measured and sustainment plans exist, and the transition itself is eventually executed.
Transition Planning must acknowledge that, within the life of the program, there may
be multiple transition events as individual projects close, as interdependent projects
close, or as other work activity within the program closes.
The receiver in the transition process will vary depending on the event and on the
program type. A product support organization could be the receiver for a product line
that a company develops. For a service provided to customers, it could be the service
management organization. If the work products are developed for an external cus-
tomer, the transition could be to the customer’s organization. In some cases, the
transition may be from one program to another.
Transitions are often formal contract-based activities, but they can also be activities
between functions in a single organization. The key to an effective transition plan is
a clear understanding of what is to be handed off and the requirements made of the
recipient in accepting the handoff.
Program management processes must be complemented by similar processes within
the receiving organization. In other words, Transition Planning and the activities within
the program are only one part of the complete transition process. The receiving
organization or function is responsible for all preparation processes and activities
within their domain to ensure that the product, service or result is received and
incorporated into their domain.

3.5.4 Resource Planning

Resource Planning is the process of determining the people, equipment, materials
and other resources that are needed, and in what quantities, in order to perform
program activities and optimize the use of available resources across the program.
Priority should be given to those skills that are critical to the program but are not
possessed by any current program team member. Operational teams and subject
matter experts should be actively involved in identifying candidates for the open
positions.
Resource Planning at the program level must pay careful attention to how common
program resources are allocated across projects to ensure that they are not overcom-
mitted. Historical information regarding what types of resources were required for
similar projects on previous programs should be used if available.
Contracts awarded by organizations external to the program can be issued by the
customer or sponsor. The product requirements, boundaries of the program, methods
of acceptance, and high-level scope statement may be documented in the form of a
contract, statement of work (SOW), or program scope statement.

Table 3-7. Resource Planning: Inputs and Outputs

3.5.5 Scope Definition

The Scope Definition Process starts with the program charter, the preliminary scope
statement, and benefits realization plan. The objective of this process is to develop a
detailed program scope statement. The appropriate approach for deriving the program
work breakdown structure (PWBS) (in Section 3.5.6) will also be defined here.
The primary outputs of this process are the program scope statement and scope
management plan. The program scope statement becomes the basis for future program
decisions and articulates the scope boundaries of the program. The scope management
plan identifies how the scope will be managed throughout the program.

3.5.6 Create Program WBS

The Create Program WBS Process produces a program work breakdown structure
(PWBS) that communicates from the program-level perspective a clear understanding
and statement of the technical objectives and the end item(s) or end product(s),
service(s), or result(s) of the work to be performed.
A PWBS is a deliverable-oriented hierarchical decomposition encompassing the
total scope of the program, and includes the deliverables to be produced by the
constituent components. Elements not in the PWBS are outside the scope of the
program. The PWBS includes, but is not limited to, program management artifacts
such as plans, procedures, standards and processes, the major milestones for the
program, program management deliverables, and program office support deliverables.
The PWBS is a key to effective control and communication between the program
manager and the managers of component projects: the PWBS provides an overview
of the program and shows how each project fits in. The decomposition should stop
at the level of control required by the program manager. Typically, this will correspond
to the first one or two levels of the WBS of each component project. In this way, the
PWBS serves as the controlling framework for developing the program schedule, and
defines the program manager’s management control points that will be used for earned
value management, as well as other purposes.
The PWBS components at the lowest level of the PWBS are known as program
packages. The complete description of the PWBS components and any additional
relevant information is documented in the PWBS dictionary, which is an integral part
of the PWBS.
The PWBS does not replace the WBS required of each project within the program.
Instead, it is used to clarify the scope of the program, help identify logical groupings
of work for components, identify the interface with operations or products, and clarify
the program’s conclusion. It is also the place to capture all non-project work within
the program. This includes program management artifacts developed for use within
the program office, external deliverables such as public communications, and end-
solution deliverables overarching the projects, such as facilities and infrastructure
upgrades.

3.5.7 Schedule Development

Schedule Development is the process of defining the program components needed
to produce the program deliverables, determining the order in which the components
should be executed, estimating the amount of time required to accomplish each one,
identifying significant milestones during the performance period of the program, and
documenting the outcome.
A program schedule is typically created using the program work breakdown structure
(PWBS) as the starting point. The individual project managers build the detail for their
specific project; this detail is rolled up at the management control points into program
packages for the PWBS. The interdependencies between the constituent projects must
also be reflected and managed in the program schedule. The schedule includes all of
the program packages in the PWBS that produce the deliverables. The program sched-
ule will include timelines of various program packages and non-project program
activities, and indicate significant milestones.
An essential element of schedule development is determining timing of the program
packages, which allows the scheduler to forecast the date on which the program will
finish, as well as finish dates for the milestones within the program (e.g., key delivera-
bles within each constituent project).
In addition to producing the program schedule, this process normally creates a
plan by which the schedule will be managed over the life of the program. This schedule
management plan becomes part of the program management plan.

3.5.8 Cost Estimating and Budgeting

Cost Estimating is the process of aggregating all costs at the program level into a
program estimate. It will include all program activity and project and non-project
activity. The estimates are either made by the program team for the entire program
or aggregated based on individual estimates of projects and work packages.
Cost Budgeting is the process of establishing budgets for the program based on the
budgets for the individual projects, the non-project activity and any financial con-
straints that impose boundaries on the budget. The latter may be a consequence of
fiscal year budgetary planning cycles or funding limits for particular periods. Since
programs can span multiple planning periods, the program team may use different
budget techniques over the program life cycle.

Table 3-11. Cost Estimating and Budgeting: Inputs and Outputs

3.5.9 Quality Planning

Quality Planning is the process of identifying the standards that are relevant to the
program and specifying how to satisfy them. Quality Planning and preparation must
happen early in the program to ensure that the competency is available during the
planning stages of critical program activities and processes. Quality Planning should

take advantage of existing quality expertise and methodologies (ISO 9000, Six Sigma,
etc.) within the program domain. If the latter are required but do not exist, then they
should be implemented within the program.

Table 3-12. Quality Planning: Inputs and Outputs

3.5.10 Human Resource Planning

Human Resource Planning is the process of identifying, documenting, and assigning
program roles, responsibilities, and reporting relationships. The individuals and groups
may be part of the program’s organization or external to it. Internal organizational
elements include the program management team, representatives from functional
areas within the enterprise, such as finance and human resources, and key individuals
in the project management teams that are under the jurisdiction of the program
manager. External organizational entities may include external end-users of the solu-
tion(s) delivered by the program, as well as other organizations with a stake in the
program and its successful outcome.

3.5.11 Communications Planning

Communications Planning is the process of determining the information and commu-
nication needs of the program stakeholders, who needs what information, when they
need it, how it will be given to them and by whom.
Adequate communications requirements must be conveyed as input to the projects
in order to facilitate information capture from the projects to be fed back into the
program.

Table 3-14. Communications Planning: Inputs and Outputs

3.5.12 Risk Management Planning and Analysis

Risk Management Planning and Analysis is the process of deciding how to plan and
analyze risk management activities for a program, including risks identified in the
individual program components.
Risk Management Planning and Analysis consists of four steps:
● Identification of the risks affecting the program and documenting their characteris-
tics on a regular basis throughout the program
● Qualitative risk analysis of the effects of risks and conditions on the delivery of
program benefits
● Quantitative risk analysis of the probability and consequences of risks, and evaluat-
ing the ir imp l icat ions for program benef its de l ivery , in order to pr ior it ize r isk
responses
● Risk response planning to develop procedures and techniques to enhance opportu-
nities and reduce threats to the delivery of program benefits.

It is important that the program management involvement in risk should support
the risk management activities of the program components. Program-specific risk
activities include the following:
● Identifying and analyzing inter-project risks;
● Reviewing the risk response plans of the program components for proposed actions
that could affect other components and modifying them as needed
● Determining root causes
● Proposing solutions to risks escalated by component managers

● Implementing response mechanisms that benefit more than one component
● Managing a contingency reserve (in terms of cost and/or time) consolidated across
the entire program.

3.5.13 Plan Program Purchases and Acquisitions

Plan Program Purchases and Acquisitions is the process of determining what to procure
and when, validating product requirements, and developing procurement strategies.
This process precedes the Plan Program Contracting Process and generates several
outputs that become inputs to contract planning.
A primary function of Plan Program Purchases and Acquisitions is to analyze the
program scope statement, the product descriptions that define the deliverables, and
the program work breakdown structure (PWBS). Make-or-buy decision techniques are
applied to the results of the analyses to determine which PWBS elements will be
produced using internal resources available to the program and which will be obtained
from outside suppliers. Once these determinations are made and approved, this infor-
mation is passed to the Plan Program Contracting Process, where potential sources
are identified and formal contracting documents are created.

3.5.14 Plan Program Contracting

Plan Program Contracting is the process of identifying the type and detail of documen-
tation required to implement contracts for suppliers either external to or within the
organization. For a program, the range and complexity of documentation for contract-
ing will be far greater than for a project. For example, most often contracting at the
program level needs to address legal issues and considerations. This process produces
the foundation and guidelines on which an effective program-level contract adminis-
tration process can be implemented.

3.6 Executing Process Group

The Executing Process Group is comprised of the processes that drive the program
work in accordance with the program management plan and its subsidiary plans, if
applicable. These processes ensure that benefits management, stakeholder manage-
ment, and program governance are executed in accordance with established policies
and plans.
Using these processes, the program team acquires and marshals the resources
needed to accomplish the goals and benefits of the program, including internal pro-
gram staff, contractors, and suppliers.
The Executing Process Group involves managing the cost, quality, and schedule
plans, often as an integrated plan, and providing status information and requested
change s to the p rog ram ’s Mon i to r ing and Con t ro l l ing P roces s G roup , th rough
approved change requests, corrective actions, and preventive actions.
The Executing Process Group also ensures that all stakeholders receive necessary
information in a timely manner. This includes administering all of the program’s
communications channels and providing information such as status updates, notifica-
tions of change requests and approvals, and responses to governmental and regula-
tory agencies.

3.6.1 Direct and Manage Program Execution

Direct and Manage Program Execution is the process of delivering the program’s
intended benefits. This process focuses specifically on those projects and program
work packages currently in progress and integrates other Executing Processes. Its
purpose is to produce the cumulative deliverables and other work products of the
program. It facilitates and resolves inter-project issues, risks, and constraints.
Program management plan execution becomes the primary responsibility of the
program manager and the program team once the initial planning activities are com-
pleted and execution of the program has begun (although the other Process Groups
remain active, particularly Planning and Monitoring and Controlling). Progress of the
work is tracked regularly via updates on individual projects, and is passed on to the
Performance Reporting Process.
In addition to producing deliverables, this process implements approved change
requests, corrective actions, and preventive actions once they have been integrated
with the relevant plans. Finally, this process is responsible for ensuring that all transi-
tion plans are executed at both the project and program level.

3.6.2 Perform Quality Assurance

Perform Quality Assurance is the process of evaluating overall program performance
on a regular basis to provide confidence that the program will comply with the relevant
quality policies and standards. It is performed throughout the life cycle of the program.
The Perform Quality Assurance Process, within and of a program, is not intended
to replace component quality assurance efforts. Rather, Perform Quality Assurance
focuses on cross-program, inter-project and non-project activities, including the ser-
vice management activities of the program and the overarching quality needs of
the customer.

Table 3-19. Perform Quality Assurance: Inputs and Outputs

3.6.3 Acquire Program Team

The Acquire Program Team Process addresses the provision of human resources for
the program through selection of internal or external candidates. The decision to use
internal versus external resources depends upon several factors. These include the
length of time that a particular skill set is needed, the availability of internal resources
with the right skill sets, the cost of external resources, and the timing of the need.

89514$$CH3

04-11-06 12:26:54

Staffing internally involves identifying existing personnel qualified for open posi-
tions, negotiating for their services with their current management, and then transi-
tioning them to the program position. Negotiations involve the tradeoffs encountered
when moving someone from an existing position, with its corresponding responsibilit-
ies and deliverables, to the program role in the most effective manner. Consideration
must be given to the needs of existing assignments, the person’s fit for the position,
the person’s career path, and his or her ability to fit into the program environment.
Staffing externally involves the process of identifying and evaluating external candi-
dates and then selecting the best candidate for the position. Staffing externally can
mean hiring a full-time employee or securing services on a contract or consulting
basis. Consideration must be given to the long-term value of the hired skill to the
organization, and whether intellectual property acquired by the person would be better
retained in the organization by full-time employment. Another consideration is the
cost of recruiting and hiring external candidates as employees versus subcontracting,
retaining consulting staff, or rescheduling activities based on the availability of inter-
nal staff.

3.6.4 Develop Program Team

Develop Program Team is the process of building individual and group competencies
to enhance program performance . Typ ica l ly, these are competencies spec if ical ly
needed on the program team for the effective performance of the program. A successful
development plan will balance the needs of the program with the needs of the individu-
al’s career path.
Develop Program Team is an ongoing process throughout the program. In addition
to developing personnel for current assignments and roles, personnel development
needs to address succession planning, preparing individuals to assume different or
larger roles within the program at some future date, and reassignment of personnel
as the program concludes.
The process will support development of personnel by providing necessary knowl-
edge and sk i l l s pa r t i cu la r to the p rog ram o r to re levan t p rog ram managemen t
competencies.

3.6.5 Information Distribution

Information Distribution is the process of providing timely and accurate information
to program stakeholders in useful formats and appropriate media. It includes adminis-
tration of three major communications channels: the clients, the sponsors, and the
component managers. Distributed information can include the following:
● Status information on the program and projects, including progress, cost informa-
tion, risk analysis, and other relevant information to internal or external audiences
● Notification of change requests to the program and project teams, and eventually
notification of the response to the change requests
● Internal budgetary information
● External filings with government and regulatory bodies as prescribed by laws and
regulations
● Public announcements communicating information useful to the general public.

Request Seller Responses is the process of issuing requests for information (RFI),
requests for proposal (RFP), and requests for quotation (RFQ), and obtaining the

responses. These formal documents (RFI, RFP, RFQ) are used in the early stages of
planning to help evaluate ‘‘make versus buy’’ decisions, as well as to gain an under-
standing of seller interest and qualifications.

Table 3-23. Request Seller Responses: Inputs and Outputs

3.6.7 Select Sellers

Select Sellers is the process for reviewing offers, choosing among potential sellers, and
negotiating the details of the contract, including technical terms and conditions, roles
and responsibilities, deliverables, and final cost. The program-level responsibility is
to negotiate and finalize program-wide policies and agreements such as basic order
agreements and integrated volume discounts. The activity of completing the contract
between sellers and customer formally and legally is the responsibility of the Program
Contract Administration Process.

3.7 Monitoring and Controlling Process Group

At the program level, monitoring and controlling involves obtaining and consolidating
data on status and progress from individual projects or program packages (i.e., non-
project tasks). Monitoring also entails interfacing with the program governance struc-
ture to ensure the organization has a clear picture of the current benefit delivery and
expected future benefits.
Effective program performance reporting supports appropriate preventive and cor-
rective actions at the program level, especially during the delivering benefits phase of
the program life cycle. In addition, these corrective actions could also be a result of
governance oversight, especially when programs require statutory compliance with
external and governmental agencies.
For programs, integrated change control involves redirecting or modifying the pro-
gram as needed, based on feedback from individual projects or work packages. In
addition, changes could originate from interfaces with other subsystems of the program
or factors external to the program. The latter could be due to government regulations,
market changes, the economy, or political issues.

3.7.1 Integrated Change Control

Integrated Change Control is the process of coordinating changes across the entire
program, including changes to cost, quality, schedule, and scope. This process controls
the approval and refusal of requests for change, escalates requests in line with authority
thresholds, determines when changes have occurred, influences factors that create
changes, makes sure those changes are beneficial and agreed-upon, and manages how
and when the approved changes are applied. Analysis of the change request involves
identifying, documenting, and estimating all of the work that the change would entail,
including a list of all of the program management processes that need to be carried
out again (such as updating the program work breakdown structure (PWBS), revising
the program risk register, etc.). Integrated Change Control is performed throughout
the entire program life cycle from initiation through closure.
Inputs for this process include change requests from components and from pro-
gram-level and non-project activities. The outputs from this process feed back to the
component level and, as such, the process is iterative between the program and
component domains.

3.7.2 Resource Control

Resource Control is the process of managing all program resources, and their associ-
ated cost, according to the program management plan.
Resource Control is the process of monitoring human resources to ensure that
committed resources are made available to the program consistent with commitments,
resources are allocated within the program according to the plan, and resources are
released from the program as dictated by the plan. Resource Control may include
authorized cross-charging or other forms of allocation of expenses between the pro-
gram, component, and contributing functions within the organization.
Other resources include plants, test beds, laboratories, data centers, office space,
and other facilities, including real estate leases or purchases, equipment of all types,
software, vehicles, and office supplies. Some resources, such as office supplies, are
consumed by the program and must be managed as an expense.

Table 3-25. Integrated Change Control: Inputs and Outputs

Purchased non-consumable resources must be tracked to ensure that they are
returned for other use or made available for sale when they are no longer needed for
the purposes of the program, and to allow accurate financial tracking and reporting.
Some resources (e.g., software programs, office equipment) are transferred to the
receiving entity when the program is transitioned. Leased resources must be tracked
to ensure that they are returned at the expiration of the lease or when they are no
longer required, to avoid penalties or the hidden expense of ongoing lease payments.
Finally, Resource Control includes analysis of resource expenses assigned to the
program to ensure correctness and completeness.

3.7.3 Monitor and Control Program Work

Monitor and Control Program Work is the process of collecting, measuring and consol-
idating performance information, and assessing measurements and trends to generate
improvements. The Monitor and Control Program Work Process focuses on individual
project reporting to understand each project’s performance as it relates to the overall
program, as well as reporting on non-project deliverables being produced at the
program level.

These reported project results, plus those from the non-project activities, are ana-
lyzed, focusing on their interrelationships to identify conflicts and adverse impacts
that must be corrected, to identify opportunities that can be leveraged, and to deter-
mine which of these factors should result in modification of the program management
plan. This is similar to risk management; however, it is focused on performance as
opposed to risks. The consolidated information can be made available to stakeholders
through the Information Distribution Process.

Table 3-27. Monitor and Control Program Work: Inputs and Outputs

3.7.4 Issue Management and Control

Issue Management and Control is the process of identifying, tracking, and closing
issues effectively to ensure that stakeholder expectations are aligned with program
activities and deliverables. This alignment can be accomplished by several approaches,
including modification of requirements or the program scope, adjusting organizational
policies, or changing stakeholder expectations.
Issue Management and Control at the program level can also include addressing
the issues escalated from the constituent projects that could not be resolved at the
project level. These unresolved project issues can impact the overall progress of the
program and must be tracked.
When an issue is identified, it is recorded in an issues register and subjected to
analysis by a reviewing authority or body. Issue reviews should be conducted on a
regular schedule to track the status of all open issues. It is essential that each issue
be associated with an owner who has the authority and means to resolve and close
the issue; when an issue is unresolved, it is then escalated progressively higher on the
authority scale until resolution can be achieved. There should be a governance process
and procedures that selectively allow issues to receive appropriate visibility for possible
impact across other portfolios within the organization.
The Issue Management and Control Process is carried out in parallel with controlling
risk, especially those risks which do not get resolved at the project level.

3.7.5 Scope Control

Scope Control is the process for controlling changes to the program scope. This is a
formal process for accomplishing the following tasks:
● Capturing requested changes
● Evaluating each requested change
● Deciding the disposition of each requested change
● Communicating a decision to impacted stakeholders
● Archiving the change request and its supporting detail
● When a request is accepted, initiating the activities required to have the change
incorporated into the program management plan.

Table 3-29. Scope Control: Inputs and Outputs

3.7.6 Schedule Control

Schedule Control is the process of ensuring that the program will produce its required
deliverables and solutions on time. The activities in this process include tracking the
actual start and finish of activities and milestones against the planned timeline, and
updating the plan so that the comparison to the plan is always current. Schedule

Control must work closely with the other program and portfolio control processes. It
involves identifying not only slippages, but also opportunities.

Table 3-30. Schedule Control: Inputs and Outputs

3.7.7 Cost Control

Cost Control is the process of controlling changes to, and producing information from,
the program budget. Cost Control is proactive, analyzing actual cost as incurred against
the plan to identify variance from the plan, and, where possible, doing trend analysis
to predict problem areas early. Cost Control is also reactive, dealing with unanticipated
events or necessary but unplanned activities that affect the budget either negatively
or positively. Cost Control is frequently thought of as merely holding down cost so
that the program remains on budget, or bringing it back to budget when there is an
overrun. However, of equal importance, cost control involves identifying opportunities
to return funding from the program to the enterprise wherever possible.

3.7.8 Perform Quality Control

Perform Quality Control is the process of monitoring specific program deliverables
and results to determine if they fulfill quality requirements. This process identifies
faulty outcomes and allows the elimination of causes of unsatisfactory performance
at all stages of the quality loop, from the identification of needs to the assessment of
whether the identified needs have been satisfied or not. The Perform Quality Control
Process ensures that quality plans are executed at project levels, via quality reviews
and project management health checks. Perform Quality Control is performed through-
out the program. Program results include both products and services, such as delivera-
bles, management results, and cost and schedule performance.

Table 3-32. Perform Quality Control: Inputs and Outputs

3.7.9 Communications Control

Communications Control is the process of managing communications to inform the
stakeholders about the program and resolve issues of interest to them. The Communi-
cations Control Process ensures that policies and procedures are received, recorded,
and routed to the intended recipients (through the Information Distribution Process).
The scope and extent of this process is much wider at the program level than at the
project level. Apart from the program sponsor, the other stakeholders involved in a
program could include product managers, financial managers, and senior manage-
ment personnel, especially those involved in strategic planning.
Furthermore, since programs tend to be of larger size, greater cost, and much longer
in duration, proactive communication is required with the community at large. Such
external communications will not only include addressing issues specific to a program,
such as environmental issues, but also managing public and media relations at the
social and political level as may be appropriate to the program.

3.7.10 Performance Reporting

Performance Reporting is the process of consolidating performance data to provide
stakeholders with information about how resources are being used to deliver pro-
gram benefits.
Performance reporting aggregates all performance information across projects and
non-project activity to provide a clear picture of the program performance as a whole.

Table 3-33. Communications Control: Inputs and Outputs

This information is conveyed to the stakeholders by means of the Information Distribu-
tion process to provide them with needed status and deliverable information. Addition-
ally, this information is provided to stakeholders of the program and its constituent
projects for the purpose of providing them with general and background information
about the program’s performance.

Table 3-34. Performance Reporting: Inputs and Outputs

3.7.11 Risk Monitoring and Control

Risk Monitoring and Control is the process of tracking identified program risks, identi-
fying new risks to the program, executing risk response plans, and evaluating their
effectiveness in reducing risk through the program life cycle. They include oversight
of risks and responses at the project level within the program. Risk Monitoring and
Control is an ongoing process.
Risk monitoring involves tracking program-level risks currently identified in the risk
response plan and identifying new risks that emerge during the execution of the
program, for example, unresolved project-level risks that demand resolution at the
program level. It includes determining whether new risks have developed, current

risks have changed, risks have been triggered, risk responses are in effect where neces-
sary and are effective, and if program assumptions are still valid.
Risk control focuses on risks that threaten to develop into actual problems or
have already done so. Risk control involves implementing the response actions and
contingency plans contained in the risk response plan.
When risks remain unresolved, the program manager ensures that these risks are
escalated progressively higher on the authority scale until resolution can be achieved.
Governance process and procedures should be in place to allow risks to be assessed
as necessary for possible impact across the organization.
Program risk situations, plans, and the status and the effectiveness of ongoing or
completed risk responses should be included in program management reviews. All
modifications resulting from reviews and other changes in risks should be entered in
the risk response plan.

3.7.12 Program Contract Administration

Program contract administration is the process of managing the relationship with
sellers and buyers at the program level, excluding such processes performed at the
componen t leve l . The p roce ss in c ludes pu rcha se s and p rocu remen t o f ou t s ide
resources that span the program domain and that are not covered by a specific project.
The program management team must be aware of the legal, political, and managerial
implications during implementation, since contractual issues can affect deadlines,
have legal and costly consequences, and can produce adverse publicity. The team
must effectively communicate with sponsors, sellers, governing bodies, and the project
and program management teams.
At the program level, program contract administration relies on the interaction of
other program and project processes.

3.8 Closing Process Group

The Closing Process Group formalizes acceptance of products, services, or results that
bring the program, or a project within a program, to completion. The Closing Process
Group includes the processes required to terminate formally all the activities of a
program, finalize closure of a project within the program and hand-off the completed
product to others, or to close a cancelled program or project within the program.
The purposes of the Closing Processes include the following:
● To demonstrate that all program benefits have been delivered and that the scope
of work has been fulfilled or to document the current state in the case of early
termination
● To demonstrate that contractual obligations with the seller and/or the customer
have been met or to document the current state in the case of early termination
● To demonstrate that all payments to the seller or from the customer have been
delivered or to document the current state in the case of early termination
● To release all human resources and to demonstrate that all other resources have
either been made available to other activities, sold, discarded, returned to the owner,
transferred to the organization maintaining the product or service, or transferred
to the customer, or otherwise disposed of
● To demonstrate that all required documentation has been archived in the manner
prescribed by the program management plan, or to document the current state in
the case of early termination
● To demonstrate that any intellectual property developed during the course of the
program has been captured and documented for future use, in a manner that
ensures legal protection of this valuable asset
● To transition ongoing activities such as product support, service management, or
customer support from a project or the program to an operational support function
● To leave in place a legacy of operational benefit sustainment, deriving optimum
value from the work accomplished by the program.

Program closure activities happen throughout the program, not just at program
completion. As specific projects and other activities are completed, closing activities
must occur. Otherwise, valuable program information will be lost, and there is a
potential that the program will not meet its closure obligations.

3.8.1 Close Program

Close Program is the process of formalizing the acceptance of the program’s outcome
by the sponsor or customer. However, administrative closure should not wait until
the program has completed the execution process. Projects under the program need
to be closed before the program is closed. As each project or each non-project activity
closes, the Close Program Process should be performed to capture information and
records, archive them, communicate the closure event and status, and obtain sponsor
or customer sign-off.
Formal acceptance of the program is achieved by reviewing, with the sponsor or
customer, the program scope and the closure documents of the program’s constituent
projects and non-project activities. These closure documents include the sponsor’s
or customer’s sign-off of the projects or non-project activities, and the results of any
verification of deliverables against requirements. Once the review is complete, the
sponsor or customer is asked to acknowledge a final acceptance by signing the closure
documents.
During this process, the lessons learned are input from other program management
processes that created them as outputs. In this process, they are analyzed, significant
lessons learned are incorporated into the closure report output, and all lessons learned
are included in the program archives.

3.8.2 Component Closure

Component Closure is the process of performing program management activities to
close out a project or other non-project activity within the program. Program compo-
nent closure deals with these closure issues at the program level, that is, it is informed
by and performed at a higher level than normal project closure occurring at the project
level. This process involves validating and ensuring that the project closure has indeed
taken place at the project level. The resources that become available may be reallocated
to other components that are either active or awaiting activation within the program.
Project records must be closed and archived as needed. Communications to a larger
or different set of stakeholders than those at the project level may be needed, as well.
The information required for this process is obtained from each of the projects or
work packages. For a program, component closure will normally be done at the end
of the project life cycle. However, project closure may need to be done if a project is
being terminated before the completion of its life cycle. This can be the result of a
program benefits review or changes in the external environment.

3.8.3 Contract Closure

Contract Closure is the process of closing out a contract executed during the program
and on behalf of the program, in accordance with the contract’s terms and conditions.
This process also applies to cases of premature contract termination.
Contract Closure involves both product verification (i.e., verifying that the work was
done) and the updating of all contract records. In the case of premature termination,
it involves documentation of actual work performed plus work not performed, the
circumstances that caused termination, and the updating of all contract records.
Contract records are important and include the contract itself and other relevant
documentation, such as progress reports, financial records, invoices, and payment
records. These are often kept in a contract file, which should be part of the complete
program file.
Contract documentation is also important should a procurement audit or legal
action be initiated. Such an audit is a structured review of the procurement process
from procurement planning through contract administration. In case of legal action,
accurate and complete documentation is critical for swift resolution.

3.9 Process Interactions

There are many interact ions among prog ram managemen t p rocesses . P rocesses
receive inputs from processes that logically precede them and send outputs to succes-
sor processes. In some cases, an output from a process becomes an input to the same
process, for example, when a Planning Process iteratively updates a plan over time.
There are cases where an output of a process may pass through several other
processes in succession before returning as an input to its originating process, and
more typically, cases where an output from a process travels along a ‘‘one-way street.’’
An example of this is lessons learned, produced as output from many processes and
flowing to a single closing process, Close Program, to be analyzed, incorporated into
a program closure report, and then archived.
The complexity of the program management process model is increased when
inputs and outputs flow between the project domain, the program domain and the
portfolio domain. This can be illustrated with a few examples:

● Project schedules flow to the program domain as inputs to the Schedule Control
Process, in order to update the program’s integrated master schedule.
● Project risks flow to the program’s Risk Management Planning and Analysis Process
in a similar manner to create a comprehensive view of risks to the program.
● Corrective actions may be created by program management processes and flow
back to the project domain.
● Funding availability outputs flow from the portfolio domain to the program’s Cost
Estimating and Budgeting Process as inputs to the program budget, while cost
performance reports from the program flow back to the portfolio domain.

3.10 Program Management Process Mapping

As previously discussed, the program management processes defined in this standard
are organized into five Program Management Process Groups. The PMBOK威 Guide—
Third Edition defines nine Project Management Knowledge Areas. In the table below,
the program management processes are associated with their respect ive Process
Groups and correlated to the nine Knowledge Areas in which most of the activities
associated with the program take place.

Initial Development of
The Standard for Program
Management

B.1 Introduction

Since 1996, project managers and organizations have recognized the standard for one
project: PMI’s A Guide to the Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK威 Guide).
Then in 2003, PMI introduced its first standard for organizations called the Organiza-
tional Project Management Maturity Model (OPM3威).
Early in 2003, recognizing that the project management profession encompasses a
much broader field, including managing multiple projects through programs and
portfolios, PMI’s Standards Program Team (SPT—which includes the PMI Manager
of Standards plus the Member Advisory Group) chartered the development of ‘‘a
standard, or standards,’’ for program management and portfolio management pro-
cesses.
Like the PMBOK威 Guide standard for ‘‘most projects most of the time,’’ the charter
for the PPMS (Program and Portfolio Management Standards) Program was to focus
on processes that are generally recognized as good practice most of the time. Moreover,
the new standard or standards were to emulate the PMBOK威 Guide—Third Edition,
specifically excluding Knowledge Areas as well as tools and techniques. The new
standard or standards, however, were to map content relationships to processes and
Knowledge Areas lined in the PMBOK威 Guide—Third Edition.

B.2 Preliminary Work

In the summer of 2003, the PPMS Team formed, eventually including 416 PMI volun-
teers representing 36 countries under the leadership of David Ross, Project Manager,
and Paul Shaltry, Deputy Project Manager.
One of the first challenges was the need to establish common agreement on the
key definitions, in this case, ‘‘program,’’ ‘‘program management,’’ ‘‘portfolio,’’ and
‘‘portfolio management.’’ The PMI Standards Manager brought together all of the
active standards teams to achieve consensus on these definitions. The involved team

leaders agreed in time for common definitions to be included in the PMBOK威 Guide—
Third Edition and form the foundation for the program and portfolio management
standards.
Next, the PPMS Team looked at whether the two subjects should be combined as
one standard or treated separately. A sub-team was formed to perform a literature
survey and poll the PM community to determine the differences and similarities
between program and portfolio management processes. The research confirmed that
while program management processes provide for the management of a group of
interdependent projects, portfolio management comprises continuous, repeatable,
and sustainable processes designed to map business requirements and objectives to
projects and programs. As a result of this investigation, the PPMS Team concluded
that the profession would be best served with two standards.
Despite the differences in these processes, the PPMS Team believed that because
of the relationships between the two subjects and that these were first time standards,
it would be best to manage them both under one program. The PPMS Core Team
proposed this approach to the SPT, which approved the recommendation. In kind,
the PPMS Team developed detailed requirements for each standard that the SPT also
approved. The Core Team developed a program plan and general team orientation,
which was mandatory, to help volunteers engage effectively. Development of both
standards began in early 2004.

B.3 Drafting The Standard for Program Management

The Program Management Architecture Team (ProgMAT), jointly led by Clarese Walker
and David Whelbourn, organized into four sub-teams: one for each chapter (1-3) and
integration.
The team recognized early that the processes for program management closely
paralleled those of project management, but were larger in scope. In addition, program
management further distinguished itself by containing three broad themes that are
common throughout each program: benefits management, stakeholder management
and governance.
While most of the work was done virtually, the team gathered for a meeting in
Philadelphia in October 2004 to finalize the document. In the last quarter of 2004, the
ProgMAT’s draft standard underwent separate reviews by the PPMS Edit and Quality
Teams in preparation for a broader review by, potentially, the whole PPMS Team.
This broader review emulated the eventual global exposure draft review that PMI
would conduct. The ‘‘mini-exposure draft’’ process generated over 400 comments
from PPMS volunteers around the world.
The ProgMAT’s work benefited from these comments and recommendations in
the improvement or confirmation of content, even though a significant number of
comments received were editorial. In general, this internal exposure draft process
validated that the ProgMAT’s draft was on target, as reviewers did not identify any
major gaps.

B.4 Delivering the First Standard for Program Management

The PPMS Core Team guided the final revisions and submitted the revised version to
the general PPMS Team for a consensus vote. The overwhelming majority of those
voting indicated acceptance of the proposed standard without reservation. The Core

Team approved the proposed standard before turning it over to the SPT for review
and approval in March 2005. The SPT engaged independent subject matter experts
to augment the review process. From there, minor refinements were made and the
proposed standard went on to a 90-day exposure draft process starting in June 2005.
The exposure draft period for The Standard for Program Management ended August
19, 2005. PMI received 465 comments that the PPMS Adjudication Team reviewed.
More than half of these comments were accepted, accepted with modification, or
identified for review in the next version of the standard. The PPMS Core Team approved
the actions of the Adjudication Team and directed the final edit and approval of the
proposed standard. Only one adjudication action was appealed, and PMI’s Adjudica-
tion Appeals Team subsequently resolved it.
In December 2005, the PPMS Core Team transferred the final draft for approval by
the PMI Standards Consensus Body and subsequent publication.

Appendix D

Program Management Tools and
Techniques

Common tools and techniques can be thought of as common practice. They are those
influences on the processes that the program team brings to the program. Among the
tools and techniques common for many program management processes are those
presented below.

1. Expert Judgment
Expert judgment may be obtained from a variety of sources both internal and
external to the program. These sources often include functional and technical
area specialists assigned to the program and in other organizational units within
the enterprise, external consultants, professional and technical associations, and
specialized governmental and industry bodies.

2. Meetings
All Program Management Process Groups require some form of deliberation
and discussion before decisions are made or output of a process is achieved.
Meetings can be face-to-face or in a virtual setting. Since many of the program
management processes require participation from various personnel, groups or
functions, conducting meetings serves as an effective technique that provides
benefits from the synergistic approach taken.

3. Reviews
Reviews are typically internal activities such as management or peer reviews
conducted before communicating with program stakeholders. Reviews can take
other forms as well.
Project reviews provide insight into status and plans for each project and the
impact on the overall program. As stated in Chapter 1, benefit reviews are also
very important to ensure that the outlined benefit process is followed, and that
each benefit is being monitored and tracked effectively.
Phase gate reviews are carried out at key decision points in the program life
cycle to provide an independent assessment of the status of the program and
to provide an assurance that identified critical success factors, best practices,
and program risks are being addressed.

Policies and procedures serve to implement standards, processes, and work
methods, resulting in the completion of the work required by the program.
Policies and procedures cover classification of information, restrictions on distri-
bution, and requirements for retention. Organizational policies dictate required
contents of a program management artifact such as a plan, the specific method-
ology used to create the artifact, and the approval process for the artifact.
Risk responses may include taking steps to mitigate or avoid a risk, developing
plans to be carried out if a risk becomes real, transferring a risk by means such
as subcontracting or third-party insurance or accepting the risk. Conversely,
risk responses may include an effort to increase the likelihood of capitalizing
on known opportunities.
It is important that the program management involvement in risk should
support the risk activities of the program component. Program-specific risk
activities include the following:
● Identifying inter-project risks;
● Reviewing the risk response plans of the component projects for proposed
actions that could affect other component projects—and modifying them as
needed;
● Determining root causes at a multi-project level;
● Proposing solutions to risks escalated by component project managers;
● Implementing response mechanisms that benefit more than one component
project;
● Managing a contingency reserve (in terms of cost and/or time) consolidated
across the entire program.

Appendix E

Benefits Assurance and
Sustainment

E.1 Purpose

This appendix addresses aspects of program management beyond the multi-project
management and benefits management that are the main focus of this standard. These
other aspects are firmly grounded in previous project management standards but
apply less universally in program management organizations.

E.2 Background

The 1996 and 2000 editions of the PMBOK威 Guide addressed programs in paragraph
1.5 defining a program as ‘‘a group of projects managed in a coordinated way to obtain
benefits not available from managing them individually. Many programs also include
elements of ongoing operations.’’ These editions of the Guide listed examples which
included ‘‘ongoing manufacturing and support . . . in the field’’ along with the project
elements which design and deliver the product. These editions went on to cite other
examples that include multiple releases over time and repetitive or cyclical undertak-
ings.
The PMBOK威 Guide—Third Edition and the Organizational Project Management
Maturity Model (OPM3威) standard use the same def in it ion o f P rogram , wh ich is
changed from the earlier editions of the PMBOK威 Guide. The first sentence remains
unchanged while the second sentence was revised to say, ‘‘Programs may include
elements of related work outside the scope of the discrete projects in the program.’’
This broader definition is consistent with and does not exclude the ‘‘ongoing opera-
tions’’ aspects cited in the earlier PMBOK威 Guide editions.
While the examples given in the third edition no longer include ‘‘support in the
field,’’ they continue to refer to multiple releases and the repetitive or cyclical undertak-
ings. The intent is confirmed in OPM3 paragraph 4.4 which states that ‘‘The linking
of Program Management to ongoing operations positions it as more inclusive than
Project Management, and indicates a greater involvement with the general manage-
ment of the organization and other management disciplines.’’ OPM3 goes on to say
that, in addition to multi-project management, program management is also differenti-
ated from project management by ‘‘elements of ongoing operations, such as post

deployment management of the products and services produced and deployed by the
program’’ and notes that ‘‘Program Management may include the entire product life
cycle considerations such as upgrades or additional releases.’’
The OPM3 standard goes on to note that ‘‘Ongoing operations may include several
recurring or administrative functions that are the responsibility of the program, such
as supplier relationship and equipment maintenance’’ and can include ‘‘the ongoing
activity of monitoring and ensuring the benefits expected of the program.’’ OPM3
offers specific guidance to its use in the area of program management stating that
use of its best practices and capabilities must consider both aspects—multi-project
management and product-related.

E.3 Assuring and Sustaining Benefits

In the context of Program Management, as used in the main body of The Standard
for Program Management, programs focus on benefits. The ongoing activities discussed
above can be said to focus on benefits assurance during the continuing delivery and
benefits sustainment during the field support of the product. Each project, by PMBOK威
Guide definition, is responsible for the creation and delivery of a product, service or
result the completion of which defines the end point in the project life cycle. Programs,
on the other hand, can continue beyond the project life cycle to continue the delivery
or deployment of the product developed by a project. This program activity focuses on
management activities such as production of additional product and the preparation of
additional customers to receive and use the product.
Clearly, the groundwork for ongoing deployment must be laid by the project during
its life cycle, but the activity involved in continued deployment and sustaining the
benefits after deployment is beyond the scope of the project. It is an inherent element
of project management to ensure that the intended customer can use and maintain
the product. This levies a responsibility for product support planning and execution
on most projects.
The responsibility for benefits sustainment (product support) to ensure that the
customer remains able to use and maintain and that the product continues to deliver
the benefits expected by the customer falls outside the traditional project life cycle,
but very often within the program life cycle. While it may follow a structured approach,
ongoing product support does not usually define its work with a WBS and control
activities such as earned value management are generally not applicable. Program
Management of ongoing product support can entail the following activities:
● Monitoring the performance of the product from a reliability and availability-for-
use perspective and comparing that performance to that predicted during the devel-
opment of the product.
● Monitoring the continued suitability of the deployed product to provide the benefits
expected by the customers owning and operating it. This can include the continued
viability of interface with other products and the continued completeness of the
product functionality.
● Monitoring the continued availability of logistics support for the product in light
of technology advancements and the willingness of vendors to continue to support
older configurations.
● Directly responding to customer inputs on their needs for product support assis-
tance or for improvements in performance or functionality
● Providing on-demand support for the product either in parts, improved technical
information or real-time help desk support.

04-11-06 12:29:47

● Planning for and establishing operational support of the product separate from the
program management function without relinquishing the other product support
functions.
● Initiating new projects to respond to operational issues with the deployed product
being supported. Such issues can include the need to improve reliability problems,
address software anomalies, update configurations to ensure continued effective
interface with other products or to provide additional functionality to meet evolving
requirements.
● Initiating new projects to respond to logistics issues with the deployed product
being supported. Such issues can include the continued ability to support a physical
product or associated support equipment with spare parts which may require engi-
neering retrofit changes to ensure continued supportability.
● Updating technical information concerning the product in response to frequent
product support queries.
● Planning the transition of product support from program management to an opera-
tions function within the organization.
● Planning the retirement and disposition of the product or the cessation of product
support with appropriate guidance to the current customers.

E.4 Organizational Differences

Some organizations consider these aspects of program management to be the responsi-
bility of operational management functions and the nature of this distinction between
operational and program management hence differs from organization to organization.
In some product-oriented organizations, a program team is continually monitoring
the performance of, and customer satisfaction with delivered products.
Such organizations use program management to coordinate the processes of perfor-
mance assurance, launching of new projects to improve products or satisfy emerging
customer desires, and ongoing delivery of products both baseline and improved. Other
organizations separate the functions of product development, production/delivery,
and product support depending on an operations element to maintain contact with
customers using the product and expecting them to identify the need for project
activity to improve products or create new products in response to emerging demand.
Still others maintain a close working relationship between program and operational
management, but ensure that the functions and responsibilities are separate after
some point in time in the product life cycle. In most cases, the functions of product
support from a logistics perspective are separated from program management once
the project or program has ensured the successful deployment of a properly sup-
ported product.

E.5 Critical Success Factors

Critical success factors associated with these ongoing benefits assurance and sustain-
ment elements include:
● Assuring that, in the project and program environments, the creation of a new
product or service is accompanied by the development and deployment of support
for that output.

89514$$CH8

04-11-06 12:29:47

● Assuring that the demands for continuing delivery/deployment are understood so
that resources can be appropriately applied to maintain the schedule and satisfy
customer expectations.
● Assuring that ongoing product support adds value by managing the post-production
product life cycle. The value added by that management must be greater than the
cost of management. Since every product has a life cycle and every project has a
beginning and end (is a temporary endeavor), project management principles can
be leveraged to increase value within the program.
● Assuring that upstream projects (the performing organization or the project that
creates the product) define and otherwise provide life-cycle information to support
benefits sustainment (product support) for management of the product life cycle.
● Assuring that there is ongoing benchmarking of support practices.
● Assuring that ongoing product support representation is present at beginning of
the project that produces the product.
● Assuring that there is a customer support organization.
● Assuring that support is properly scheduled when changes are made to the deployed
product so that customers will be able to support the updated products.
● Assuring the availability of training for support staff to understand product support
requirements.
● Assuring that repair/return facilities/processes requirements are developed and
implemented.

Program managers performing product support need to be conversant in a wide range
of quality and logistics disciplines:
● Reliability and Maintainability (R&M)—Program managers need to understand the
differences between measuring R&M during the developmental phases when such
measures usually result from laboratory testing under controlled conditions and
the operational environment where the customer is concerned with availability of
the product for use and can consider all unexpected maintenance actions as failures.
The program manager also needs to understand the processes for determining the
effectiveness of a scheduled maintenance program and optimizing such a program.
● Integrated Logistics Support (ILS)—Program managers need to understand the
elements of integrated logistics support so that they can be properly managed for
products in operational use by customers. These elements include spares support,
support equipment, technical data, packaging/handling/storage/transportation,
training, training equipment and facilities. Program managers also need to under-
stand how to respond to customer experience with the products to properly influ-
ence redesign efforts to correct problems.
● Configuration Management (CM)—Program managers dealing with deployed prod-
ucts need to ensure that configuration management efforts consider maintaining
the supportability of the products when changes are being fielded either forward
in production or via retrofit of already fielded products. It is essential to consider
that updated support must be made available on a schedule pacing the actual
deployment of the changed end items. The requirement for new configuration
equipment and support for training of personnel prior to fielding for operational
use must be considered. The program manager must be able to effectively plan
and manage retrofit efforts.

Appendix F

Program Management Controls

The Project Management Institute’s Organizational Project Management Maturity
Model (OPM3威) Knowledge Foundation introduced a new attribute for program man-
agement processes called ‘‘controls.’’ OPM3 defines controls as, activities, policies or
procedures that govern the execution of the process, so that the process operates in a
consistent, predictable manner. Program management controls can be thought of as
common knowledge. They are those influences on the processes that the program
team brings to the program.
Chapter 3 of The Standard for Program Management does not associate specific controls
with the program management processes described therein. However, because of the
importance of this concept, this appendix provides a general discussion of the role played
by controls with respect to the program management processes. Among the controls
applicable to many program management processes are those below.

A. Standards
Industry and trade associations, governmental bodies, including the military,
and other groups have developed widely recognized and accepted standards,
often international in scope. Where applicable, these standards may be invoked
in contractual documents prepared by a procuring agency for a program. Stan-
dards may also be developed specifically for a program and may include quality
standards, schedule standards, training standards, and work breakdown struc-
ture standards.

B. Policies and Procedures
Policies and procedures implement standards, processes, and work methods
that result in the work required by the program being performed. They cover
classification of information, restrictions on distribution, and requirements for
retention. Organizational policies dictate required contents of a program man-
agement artifact such as a plan, the specific methodology used to create the
artifact, and approval process for the artifact.

C. Program Plans
Typically, a program is driven by a strategic plan, which includes the statement
of the business goals for the program. All work in a program should contribute
to one or more business goals. Business goals are the criteria against which
potential program activities are judged.

91

89514$$CH9

04-05-06 17:50:37

Various plans are generally encompassed in a program management plan,
which formulates and documents the management strategy and approach for
the program. The program management plan comprises a number of subsidiary
management plans, such as a:
● Cost management plan
● Communications management plan
● Procurement management plan
● Quality management plan
● Resource management plan
● Risk management plan
● Schedule management plan
● Scope management plan
● Staffing management plan.
These and other subsidiary management plans may be incorporated directly
into the same document as the program management plan or may exist as
individual document artifacts.

D. Reviews
Reviews are typically internal activities such as management or peer reviews
with their outcomes communicated to program stakeholders.
Reviews are executed as controls on numerous program management pro-
cesses in all of the Program Process Groups. Reviews may include periodic
program risk reviews and program management reviews, including phase-gate
reviews as noted in Chapter 2. Reviews of projects within the program provide
insight into status and plans for each project and the impact on the overall
program.

E. Oversight
Oversight by an executive review board or an individual executive may cause
modifications to the program if the overarching business or strategic needs
change. Executive oversight plays the key role in evaluating the proposed pro-
gram management plan with respect to the business objectives and constraints.
Resource contention at the program level will typically involve other programs
or activities outside of the program. These are the responsibility of first the
stakeho lders and then the execut ive leve l of the organ izat ion . Ove rs ight is
required during estimating and budgeting to ensure that they are well within
limits of overall organizational plans. Oversight bodies often include change
control boards with the authority to approve changes to the program’s scope,
budget, and schedule.
Oversight controls should result in sign-off by the stakeholder to confirm that
the requirements to be met by the program are both necessary and sufficient
to successfully perform the stakeholder’s function.

F. Audits
Audits may be an internal control or may be an activity imposed by the client.
In either case, the audit would require that information distributed be substanti-
ated by stored program information from which reports and distributions were
compiled. Additionally, audits could require demonstration of a process that
meets certain criteria as spelled out in the contract or agreement. Types of
audits may include: control point audits, financial audits, process audits, risk
response audits, and quality audits.

89514$$CH9

04-05-06 17:50:37

G. Contracts
Standard contractual terms and conditional clauses may be pre-developed and
approved for inclusion in contracts awarded by a procuring agency. These may
be specific to an enterprise or in the case of government agencies may apply
to all government contracts awarded.

H. Directories and Distribution Lists
Standard lists are established and maintained to control the routing and recipi-
ents of all of the formal communications and messages sent to program stake-
holders. This may include documents, presentations, reports, and memoranda
in electronic or paper media, electronic mail, information uploaded to web
sites, and information to be formally transmitted by other means and media.

I. Documentation
Documentation controls may include requiring that all formal documents relat-
ing to the program conform to style guides and documentation templates to
be created and used for documentation of a repetitive nature, such as plans,
specifications and periodic reports.

J. Regulations
Regu lat ions may st ipu late the co l lect ion of pert inent data. Regu lations can
include environmental legislation, government regulations and laws, legal opin-
ions, legislative requirements, legislative restrictions, organizational legislation,
and regu la t ions rega rd ing the sa le o r d ispo sa l o f equ ipmen t , fac i l i t ie s , o r
other property.

Appendix G

Examples of Organizational
Structuring of Programs

Section 1.6 addresses program management in relation to organizational planning.
The relationships between portfolios, programs and projects, as illustrated in Figure
1-2 of Section 1.4, not only establishes the differences between the three entities, but
the organizational implications as well. Depending on the organization’s acceptance
of portfolio management, similar business situations could conceivably result in the
establishment of one or several programs.
Take, for example, an organization that has project portfolios and whose strategic
business plan identifies three strategic initiatives:
● Develop a new customer base
● Focus on growth revenue options
● Develop a new product line.

The initiative to develop a new product line is the highest priority and two programs
are initiated to deliver the expected outlined benefits. The relationship between the
portfolio, programs and projects is depicted in Figure G-1.
On the other hand, if the organization is not using portfolio management, the
relationship might consider the program as the highest level of the hierarchy. Therefore,
the relationship between the business plan, programs and projects is as displayed in
Figure G-2, where the new product line initiative triggers a single program.

Variance From or Extensions to
Other Related PMI Standards

The Standard for Program Management has been preceded by two authoritative stan-
dards published by the Project Management Institute (PMI). These are A Guide to the
Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK威 Guide)—Third Edition and the
Organizational Project Management Maturity Model (OPM3威).
The PMBOK威 Guide—Third Edition addresses only project management processes,
the Project Domain, but served as a reference point for developing The Standard for
Program Management. The variances between the two standards are discussed below
in Section H.1.
OPM3 introduced the concept of program management processes, the Program
Domain, and described them briefly in Appendix I of that document, with the expecta-
tion that this standard would expand and elaborate upon them. The variances between
this standard and OPM3 are discussed in Section H.2.

H.1 Comparison of The Standard for Program Management and
PMBOK姞 Guide—Third Edition Processes

A Guide to the Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK威 Guide)—Third Edition
addresses project management and is the generally accepted standard for project
management processes. As a companion standard, The Standard for Program Manage-
ment addresses program management and focuses on the processes that apply to
program management. Although these processes are similar to project management
processes in many respects, they are not equivalent to them.
Whereas the PMBOK威 Guide—Third Edition identifies 44 project management pro-
cesses, this standard identifies 39 processes for program management. Furthermore,
not all of these processes are the same. Table H-1 provides a comparison of the two
sets of processes.
Program management and project management processes may have many similarit-
ies at the descriptive level. However, there are very significant differences in program
management process inputs, controls, outputs and tools and techniques and the
inputs, outputs and tools and techniques associated with project management pro-
cesses. These differences are too extensive to detail here but a comparison of the two

standards will quickly reveal many of them. This is attributable to the differences in the
roles played by processes for program management and those of project management
processes. Program management processes operate on a broader scale and at a higher
level than project management processes and must accommodate the management
of multiple projects within a program at any given point of time. This is further
complicated in that different projects in the program may be in different life cycle
phases concurrently and program management processes must allow for this situation.

H.2 Program Differences

While there are many similarities between programs and projects in the activities
required for planning at this stage of the life cycle, there are some key differences
between programs and projects.
Programs are made up of a variety of projects. In the same manner that the program
needed to go through a selection/approval stage, generally the projects that make up
the program will likewise need to be approved and prioritized. This project selection
may also have to take into account any interdependencies of the projects. This implies
that the program will either define a project selection criterion or will use one that
the organization already has in place. Either way, the program will need to consider
the projects that it will formulate and initiate for the solution, and track any work
required to get them through a selection process.
Program management generally must consider the full life cycle of the products/
initiatives that are being implemented. While project may be targeted at one particular
aspect (e.g., development of a new financial system, or deployment of new servers/
workstations for the application), programs need to consider the entire picture.
For example, on a major computer application upgrade, the following areas should
be included in the program:
● Feasibility studies for key requirements
● Development of the new version of the application system
● Project enablers such as deployment of the new hardware and software required
● Any data conversion and system transition items going from the previous version
to the new application
● Life cycle support and maintenance of the application (including help desks, train-
ing, documentation, testing and configuration management systems)
● Any shutdown costs at the end of the program (will office facilities/equipment need
to be sold/scrapped?)

The requirement to consider different phases during the life of the program also
provides some freedom for the program manager. For example, trade-offs can be
made between spending more resources during the development stage, in order to
reduce costs during support (e.g., on-line tutorials); or more time in architecture may
result in less hardware needing to be procured during deployment.
The duration of programs tend to be longer than that of projects. This has an impact
on the planning and the management of a program in different ways compared to a
project. There are greater chances of changes in:
● Staff during the program
● The sponsor’s and client’s organizations
● Technology during the life of the program
● The business environment (and hence requirements) during the program.

04-11-06 12:33:08

All of these potential changes mean that the management of the scope and communica-
tions processes will be of relatively greater importance and targeted at a more senior level
of management during the program. With the potential changes in the organizations, the
ability to maintain key senior management support is also more of a challenge.
In projects, one problem is personnel anxiety that increases towards the end of the
project. With the end coming into sight, some people are concerned with what their
next assignment may be. This creates a challenge to maintain the focus of the team
to ensure that the project completes all of the deliverables. With the duration of
programs, this can be an even greater challenge, as resources may have been on the
program for a number of years or decades. As the life cycle of a program nears, these
shut down issues can be even harder to deal with.
One of the capabilities of a program is that it may use feasibility studies and short-
term projects to determine answers to issues and verify proposed directions. Programs
will have a greater propensity to need to adjust overall direction during their life cycle
than projects as they accommodate project failures, change in deliveries/schedule
and negative results from feasibility studies. Likewise, programs have a better capacity
to adjust to ‘‘lessons learned’’ during their life cycle. These all combine to require a
tighter planning/adjusting approach than may be required in projects. The program
may need to redo significant parts of their plan during its life cycle.

H.3 Organizational Project Management Maturity Model

Organizational Project Management is defined as ‘‘The application of knowledge, skills,
tools and techniques to organizational activities and project, program and portfolio
activities to achieve the aims of an organization through projects.’’1
In December 2003, the Organizational Project Management Maturity Model (OPM3威)
was published by the Project Management Institute (PMI). The concept of organiza-
tional project management is based on the idea that there is a correlation between
project, program and portfolio management and this has been used to develop a
sequential model which will help an organization to improve its maturity and achieve
its strategic objectives. Program management is one of the domains of OPM3.
While developing the model, and as stated by the OPM3 Knowledge Foundation,
it was recognized that knowledge of program management processes is an essential
part of the route to organizational project management maturity. This aspect has been
considered while stating the charter for the PPMS project. It has been mandated that
the program management processes along with inputs, tools, and techniques, controls
and outputs as enumerated in OPM3 be taken as the first point of reference in develop-
ing The Standard for Program Management. The requirements also stated that once
developed, The Standard for Program Management should be used to update the
OPM3 Standard during its subsequent revisions.
Therefore, developing a standard for program management will be of immense use
in understanding and using a model like OPM3 and will form an integral part of its
development in future versions.
Thirty-nine program management processes were identified and defined with their
inputs, tools and techniques, controls and outputs in OPM3. These processes, along
with the project management processes contained in A Guide to the Project Manage-
ment Body of Knowledge (PMBOK威 Guide)—Third Edition served as the starting point
for the further development of the program management processes contained in this
standard. Table H-2 compares the program management processes in this standard
with those in OPM3.

The program management processes defined in OPM3 were essentially an extension
of the PMBOK威 Guide—2000 Edition project management processes. During the devel-
opment of The Standard for Program Management, considerable further research and
thought was given to the differences between program and project management. The
outcome was a set of processes that do not conflict with those in OPM3, but are much
more attuned to the nature of program management. Recognizing that programs often
include multiple projects, processes have been added to initiate and conclude projects
within the scope of a program. One significant difference is in the Planning Process
Group where some processes have been consolidated, reflecting a higher level and
less detailed planning in the Program Domain compared to the more detailed lower-
level planning that takes place in the Project Domain. A second major difference is
in the area of controls. In the Program Domain, control must be exercised over a far
broader scope and range of activities than is the case for a single project. In addition,
it was recognized that earned value management is gaining wide acceptance in the
Program Management Domain and an Earned Value Control Process was added. The
third significant difference is in the Closing Process Group in recognition that a pro-
gram often manages a more diverse range of resources, including multiple contracts
and facilities, than is usually the case with a single project.

The organizational environment needed for  project  success 
is ultimately created by management. The way that the man- 
agers define, structure, and act toward projects  is  critical  to 
the success or failure of those projects, and consequently the 
success or failure of the organization. An  effective  project 
management culture is essential for  effective  project manage- 
ment. 

This Center for  Business  Practices series of books is 
designed to help you develop an effective  project manage- 
ment culture in your organization. The  series presents the best 
thinking of some of the world’s leading project management 
professionals, who identify a broad spectrum of best prac- 
tices  for you to consider and then to implement in your own 
organizations. Written with the working practitioner in mind, 
the series provides ”must have” information on the knowl- 
edge, skills,  tools, and techniques used in superior project 
management organizations. 
A culture is a  shared set of beliefs, values, and expec- 
tations. This culture is embodied in your organization’s poli- 
cies,  practices, procedures, and routines. Effective cultural 
change occurs and will be sustained only  by altering (or in 
some cases creating) these everyday policies,  practices, pro- 
cedures, and routines in order to impact the beliefs and val- 
ues that guide employee actions. We can affect the culture by 
changing the work climate,  by establishing and implement- 
ing project management methodology, by training to that 
methodology, and by reinforcing and rewarding the changed 
behavior that results. The Center for Business  Practices series 
focuses on helping you accomplish that cultural change.

Having an effective  project management culture in- 
volves more than implementing the science of project man- 
agement, however - it  involves the art of applying project 
management skill.  It  also  involves 
the organizational changes 
that  truly  integrate  this  management  philosophy. These 
changes are sometimes structural, but they always involve a 
new  approach to managing a business: projects are a natural 
outgrowth of the organization’s  mission.  They are the way in 
which the organization puts in place the processes that carry 
out the mission. They are the way in which changes will be 
effected that enable the organization to  effectively compete 
in the marketplace. 
We hope this Center for  Business  Practices series will 
help you and your  organization excel  in  today’s rapidly chang- 
ing business world.

SOLUTIONS, 

PROJECT MANAGEMENT 
INC. is a full-service consult- 
ing and training organization supporting project management 
initiatives at Global 1000 firms.  Since its founding in 1996, 
PM Solutions has distinguished itself by focusing on improv- 
ing corporate project performance through project  office de- 
velopment, streamlining processes, just-in-time training and 
mentoring  programs,  and  corporate project management 
implementations. The  company’s  holistic approach integrates 
critical business elements with processes, enabling sound 
management decision-making. 
A cornerstone product of I“ Solutions has been its 
Project Management Maturity Model.  This model has con- 
tributed to widespread success in assisting organizations in 
improving their  project management processes.  The model 
has been used to baseline project management practices in- 
dustry-wide (see Appendix B), becoming the industry  stan- 
dard in measuring project management maturity. This  book, 
the first publication of the complete I” Solutions Project 
Management Maturity Model,  describes the model in full and 
provides you with a comprehensive tool  to help you improve 
your organization’s project management practices. 
PM Solutions Project Management Maturity Model 
provides your organization with a conceptual framework 
within which specific  project management processes  can be 
optimized to  efficiently improve the capability of your orga- 
nization. The  Project Management Maturity Model provides 
best practices to help you to: 
determine the maturity of your organization’s project 
management processes 

Project Managemen t  Ma tu r i ty  Mode l

map  out a logical path to improve your organization’s 
processes 
set priorities for short-term process improvement ac- 
tions 
discern the need for a project  office, and assess where 
it fits in your organizational structure 
track progress against your project management im- 
provement plan 
build  a culture of project management excellence. 

By focusing on  specific  processes, your organization 
can  best leverage the resources for their improvement activi- 
ties while rallying the organization around specific  goals. A 
project management maturity model can  be a roadmap show- 
ing an organization how it  can systematically move to more 
mature levels of performance and  do it  in more effective and 
efficient ways. After an objective assessment, your organiza- 
tion  can set its goals  for increasing the capability of its pro- 
cesses.  The ultimate goal of this  book  is  to help you improve 
the capability of your organization’s project management 
processes. 

How This Book is Organized 
Chapter 1 describes project management maturity and offers 
a brief description of the PM Solutions Project Management 
Maturity Model. The chapter also describes the process of 
assessing your organization using this model, and provides 
best practices  for using an assessment. 
Chapters 2 through 11 are the heart of the Project  Man- 
agement  Maturity Model. Chapter 2 defines the levels of 
project management maturity (from Level 1 through Level 
5). The following chapters are based on the nine project man- 
agement knowledge areas specified  in the Project Manage- 
ment Institute’s standard, A G u i d e t o the Project Manag em en t

Body of Knowledge (PMBOKO Guide). In these chapters, each 
knowledge area is defined at each  level of maturity. In order 
to provide as complete a definition as possible, these knowl- 
edge areas have been broken down  into their specific compo- 
nents (along with the additional special-interest subcompo- 
nent areas mentioned earlier). Then progressive maturity is 
described, level by level,  for  each component (see  Figure 1). 
So Chapters 3-11 are organized as follows: 
PMBOKO Guide Knowledge  Area (chapter title) 
General description 
Components of maturity 
Maturity level  characteristics  (for  Levels 1-5) 
Description of component qualities in each  level 

N o t e s : Definitions of component maturity are grouped by level 
within knowledge area. Achievement of a given knowledge 
area  level  by an organization is cumulative-that  is,  for each 
succeeding PMMM  level, the assumption is that all criteria 

Project Managemen t  Ma tu r i ty  Mode l 

-

for the preceding levels  for that knowledge area are being (or 
have been) fulfilled. So Level 5, for  example, assumes that 
Levels 1-4 are being fulfilled, plus Level 5. 
Finally, the appendices provide a checklist  for  self-as- 
sessing your organization’s  project management maturity, as 
well as  summary results of an industry-wide benchmarking 
survey of project management maturity.

THIS BOOK IS a great example of one of project management’s 
signal features: the creative team. As with any product that 
distills the experience and knowledge of many people work- 
ing together  over  time,  it  is 
a little hard to  give  all credit where 
it is due. I will do my best  to name names here, with the un- 
comfortable  feeling that someone is bound to be inadvert- 
ently left out. For any oversight, I apologize in advance. 
The PM Solutions Project Management  Maturity 
Model, while the product of the efforts of many PM Solu- 
tions associates over the past four years, were prepared for 
publication by  David  Yosua, PMP, Product Integration Man- 
ager. Also involved in our project to create a maturity model 
were Dianne  Bridges,  PMP, Managing Consultant; Eric Foss, 
Managing Consultant; Dave Phillips, PMP, Eastern  Region 
Manager;  Patrick  Sepate, Central Region  Manager; and Karen 
White,  PMP, Managing Consultant. 
Jim Pennypacker, director of the Center for  Business 
Practices, was invaluable as a source on project management 
research and also kept our relationship with Marcel  Dekker 
seamless. 
Thanks to  Debbie  Bigelow,  PMP,  Executive  Vice-Presi- 
dent,  Jim Oswald, PMP, Vice-president of Professional  Ser- 
vices,  Bruce  Miller,  PMP,  Vice-president of Business  Devel- 
opment, and Lori Gipp, Vice-president of Marketing and Al- 
liances, all of  PM Solutions, and Jimmie West,  Ph.D.,  PMP,  of 
I‘M College, who so effectively managed the ongoing opera- 
tions of these businesses during the writing of this book. 
I also can’t forget the many current and former associ- 
ates of  PM Solutions and the PM College who by their work

x on  behalf of clients in the field have helped to develop and 
refine our project management maturity model. 
Finally,  my deepest thanks must go to my  wife Linda 
and to  my children who tolerated my sabbaticals and many 
hours set aside to  focus  on the content of this book.

CHAPTER 1 

Describing  Project 
Management Maturity 

U NTIL JUST A few years ago, the concept of ”maturity” 
was seldom used to  describe the state of an 
organization’s effectiveness at performing certain tasks. 
Today, we find this maturity concept being used 
increasingly to map out logical ways to improve an 
organization’s services-particularly  across the software 
industry. Why has this evolved in this industry-why not 
in other areas? And why is this of interest to the project 
management profession? The answer to both of these 
questions rests in the underlying complexities that go into 
the successful  completion of a project-software 
development or otherwise. 
Looking at software, where the existing maturity 
models originated, it  is  easy to see that there are many 
ways to approach the resolution of any single software 
problem. Software efforts  typically include many more 
variables, unknowns, and intangibles than we would 
consider ”normal” for a project in many other industries. 
Because of this complexity, the expected result of a 
particular software project  may be more dependent on the 
”star” developer in a company than  anything else. 
Unfortunately, star developers go away, and,  when they 
do, or the projects  get so large and complex that the

developer’s influence on them is no longer dominant, the 
variation in project results becomes great and leads to 
inevitable frustration and disappointment. Obtaining 
predictable results becomes a real challenge. Hence the 
extensive, government-funded research into how to evolve 
and measure an organization’s  effectiveness at developing 
software, which resulted in the Software Engineering 
Instit Ae’s Capability Maturity Model. However, as we 
have seen through repeated use of this model in 
assessments, even getting organizations to the “repeatable 
results” level  can be challenging, never mind moving 
toward optimization of processes. 
It  is  logical  that  those of us  in  the  project  management 
arena  learn  from  the  efforts  to  improve  effectiveness  in  the 
software industry. Applying  project  management  concepts  in 
any organization has many  similarities  to  the  complexities and 
intangibles of software  development.  Obtaining  consistent 
results  in  any  project  environment  involves understanding 
and measuring as many  variables  as  those  that  exist  in  the 
software  development industry. We have all seen  the  results 
of heroic  efforts  from  project  managers-those  that  rise  above 
the  processes and systems tha t support them.  Take  this  single 
project  manager  (just  like  the  single “star” developer  in  the 
software environment)  out of the picture, and there  goes  the 
ability  to ensure success.  Hence  the  need  to  look  at  an 
organization’s  ”complete”  picture of project  management 
effectiveness, or project  management  maturity. 

Project  Management Maturity Model 

In organizations  where we have  done  assessments,  we  have 
seen  that  the  evolution of project  management  typically  lags 
behind development of other  capabilities  within a company. It 
isn’t until  the  need  for  project  management  becomes  critical 

Describing Project Managemen t M a t w i t y

that  organizations  pay  attention  to  improving  the  project 
management  skills  within  their  organization.  This 
lack  of 
foresight  frequently  creates  an  environment  where  the  project 
management  systems and infrastructure  are  not in  place  to 
support the  needs of the  practicing  project  management 
community.  Eventually, it becomes  necessary  to start taking a 
proactive  look at the  infrastructure  necessary  to  progress  in 
project  management  capability. In short,  the  need  becomes so 
great  that  the  organization  must  respond 
to growing  business 
pressures.  Often,  this happens when  executive  management 
decides  to  take  proactive  action-but  the  question  is:  action  in 
what direction, and to what end? 
There are a great number of interrelated challenges 
to deal with in improving an organization’s infrastructure: 
project managers aren’t getting the information they need 
to manage effectively; management is not getting accurate 
forecasts of completion data; there is inconsistent 
understanding of expectations, etc. This is often where the 
value of a maturity assessment comes into play. Any model 
selected to measure project management maturity must 
point out a logical path for progressive development. It 
may not be so important to know you are a Level 2 
organization, but rather what specific  actions you will be 
implementing to  move the organization forward. What is 
most important is that the organization has a vision and is 
moving to improve the capability of  project management 
with very targeted efforts. Improving project management 
is a series of smaller steps, not giant leaps, and many 
organizations will never need to  realize  Level 5 in maturity. 
Many organizations will  achieve  significant benefit by 
reaching the repeatable process  level area. In effect, a good 
model for the measurement of project management 
maturity creates a strategic plan for moving project 
management forward in an organization.

Key Attributes of the Knowledge Areas 

The Project Management Institute’s A G u i d e  t o  t h e Project 

M a n a g em e n t  B o d y of Know ledge ( P M B O P G u i d e ) is an 

excellent point of reference for starting  an  examination of 
project management capability.  It is already  an accepted 
standard,  and  there is a great  deal of “best practices” 
information  in existence around  the  knowledge  areas

Describing Project Manag em en t  Ma tu r i t y 

outlined in the document. Unfortunately, this  is a huge 
mass of knowledge to deal with. Measuring an 
organization’s effectiveness  in any one of the areas requires 
that  the area be broken down further into major 
components that relate that area  to the successful 
implementation of project management. 
The model that I” Solutions has developed utilizes 
the PMBO P Guide’s nine knowledge areas and is patterned 
after the SEI’S CMM. The model has five distinct levels of 
maturity and examines an organization’s implementation 
across the nine project management knowledge areas (see 
Figure 1.1). The  five  levels, similar to those in the SEI CMM 
model, are described below. Each of the levels represents a 
discrete organizational capability based on the summary- 
level characteristics.

General  Component  Description 

As mentioned previously, because the knowledge 
requirement is very large within each of the P M B O P Guide 
knowledge areas, it was necessary  to break down each of 
the nine areas into key components (see  Figure 1.2). This  is 
where the real measurement of maturity takes place. For 
example, under the scope management knowledge area, 
there are six components that must be measured to 
effectively understand maturity. The  six areas that we have 
identified within scope management include: business 
requirements definition, technical requirements definition, 
deliverables identification, scope definition, work 
breakdown structure, and scope change control. These  six

project  management  practices.  These  components  are  given  special 
attention in the PM  Solutions  Project Management  Maturity  Model. 

I 

components  are examined independently  to  determine  the 
adequacy of defining  and  controlling  the project scope. 

Business  requirements  definition is the assessment and 

development of processes, procedures, and  standards 
relating to the collection of the business-related 
requirements of the project. 

-

Describing Project Management M a t u r i t y 

T e chn i ca l  r equ i r em en t s  d e f in i t ion 

is the assessment and 
development of processes, procedures, and  standards 
relating to the collection of the technical requirements of 
the project. 
De l iverab les  iden t i f ica t ion is the process established to 
identify key items that are necessary  to complete the 
project. 
Scope d e f in i t ion involves the processes in place to 
adequately define the scope, assumptions, and constraints 
of the project. 
W o r k  b r e a k d ow n  s t r u c t u r e examines the formality with 
which an organization identifies the complete scope of 
work to be performed. This includes looking at the 
related dictionary. 

Scope  change controI looks at the process of incorporating 
additions, changes, and deletions to the project. 

From a quick  look at these six,  it’s  easy  to see that 
understanding the intricacies of project  processes  is a key 
element in determining project maturity. All knowledge 
areas must be similarly broken down. 

Three  Special  Interest  Components 

There are three areas where PM Solutions has  found 
significant influence on the adoption of project 
management practices.  These three are project  office, 
management oversight, and professional development. 
Each  of these areas has special attention given  it in the 
maturity model (see Figure 1.3). 

Project Managemen t  Ma tu r i ty  Mode l 

- 

IO Project Office. The  project  office makes the lives of project 
team members easier  by supporting the team in the areas of 
scheduling, status reporting, project  tool operation, and 
training, among others. Some of the key items of support 
that the project  office provides include consulting and 
mentoring of current staff, developing and promulgating 
methodologies and  standards relating to  project 
management, and serving as  the central source for help in 
planning  and managing efforts.  The  project  office  facilitates 
the improvement in project management maturity by being 
the focal point for consistent application of processes and 
methodologies. Often, without a project  office, the project 
management efforts of the organization are not consistent 
and are not focused toward a common vision. So, the 
project  office serves as the proverbial glue that  holds the 
project management efforts of the organization together. 
Management  Oversight. Another key component in 
facilitating an increase in project management maturity is 
the amount of management oversight and involvement that 
key leaders of the organization have in the project 
management function. The bottom line here is that if 
management isn’t interested then it  is  unlikely that 
improvement will  occur. If no one is holding the project 
manager responsible for  project accomplishment and 
consistently measuring project performance, an unwritten 
signal is being sent to the project management community. 
Managers must make  use of the data that is provided by 
the project management community and find ways to use 
this information to improve organizational performance. 

Professional  Development. The need for continued 

development of project managers is essential. Project 
management is  itself an  odd mixture of technical  skills, 
management skills, and leadership skills that few people 

Describing Project Managen len t M a t n r i t y 

naturally exhibit. Most of us require continued refinement 
and renewal of the skills.  The  project management 
profession also continues to broaden its knowledge base- 
there are always new skills  to learn in the project 
management profession.

The  Five levels of Maturity 

Why SEI CMM Is Used as the Standard 

As mentioned earlier  in this chapter, research into why 
software projects were so often completed late, over- 
budget,  and failed  to deliver what the end user really 
wanted resulted in the Software Engineering Capability 
Maturity Model  (SE-CMM), a way of measuring an 
organization’s maturity in those software engineering 
processes generally accepted as crucial  to  successful  project 
completion. This Capability Maturity Model has in turn 
become a de facto standard for  process modeling and 
assessing an organization’s maturity in several process 
areas (i.e., personnel management, systems engineering). 
Since the CMM concept has received such widespread 
acceptance,  it makes sense to develop a Project 
Management Maturity Model  (PMMM) that follows the 
same structure. 
The Key Practice  Areas with the SE-CMM include 
areas familiar to those who have read the PMBOP Gu ide: 
project  execution and control. The PMMM takes those areas 
and  further decomposes them into specific knowledge 
areas and the processes  associated with those areas. 

Notes in Measuring  Against the Five  Levels 

Too often we see the implementation of new tools  or 
techniques as a panacea that will  solve  all of our problems. 

Project Management Maturity Model 

- 

12 Maturity models can be misapplied the same way. First, 
there is the possibility of error in the performance of the 
assessment. Determining the correct  level of maturity in an 
organization is something less than science but more than 
art. There are many factors that go into determining this 
level including individual interviews, as well as evaluating 
artifacts, processes, standards, knowledge, and company 
culture. So there is a subjective nature to determining the 
level of maturity, although it’s  unlikely that a wide margin 
of error will occur. It  is  extremely important to use an 
assessment tool that has been tested and proven to  achieve 
consistent and correct results. 
Additionally,  the results of an assessment  can be 
misused. An assessment should really  be  aimed a t providing 
a  path forward for the organization  in improving its  project 
management capabilities.  Typically,  organizations start with 
a baseline  assessment of their current situation. This  is 
accomplished  by  performing a comprehensive  assessment 
evaluating all areas where project  management has an 
influence.  From  here, a periodic,  abbreviated  assessment  can 
indicate where progress is being made in the application of 
project management methodologies.  The  baseline  assessment 
enables  an  organization  to  identify  those areas that will 
provide the greatest return on  investment and will show 
where immediate actions  will  have  an impact. 
There is a great difference between each of the five 
levels; organizations should strive to  fill in the pockets that 
are weak while advancing those that will provide benefit. 
Striving to  increase the maturity level  just  for the sake of 
having a higher level  is an unwise use of the tool.  It is also 
recommended that an organization attempt to maintain a 
close relationship of levels across the various knowledge 
areas. It has been our experience that the benefits associated 
with achieving a Level 5 maturity in one knowledge area

may be erased if the other knowledge areas are all at Level 
2 maturity. 
So, what takes place during a maturity assessment? 
Any thorough assessment has the following four 
ingredients (at  a minimum): 
Personal and /o r group interviews 
Artifact  collection and evaluation 
Widespread survey input 
Benchmark comparison to established standards. 

Project Manag em en t  Ma tu r i t y Model 

- 

14 There  is  little substitute for  the  sense of discipline, 
understanding, and buy-in that can  be obtained from a direct 
personal interview with a project  management  practitioner. 
This  is a necessary  element of an assessment  to  uncover  the 
degree  to  which  policy  is put into  practice. Coupled with this 
is the collection of evidence  (artifacts) supporting the 
implementation of project  management-are  all the 
documents required by  policy  complete,  are  they of high 
quality, etc.? Third, are the  concepts of project management 
understood and utilized  by the major population that should 
have knowledge about the policies and procedures?-what 
is  the  general  view of the  project  management  requirements, 
etc.? Last, synthesizing the data and comparing this 
information against  an  established standard that is  logical, 
sound,  and clear to provide a path forward is  essential.  Any 
assessment that does not consist of at  least  these  elements 
may  leave an organization wondering where the  benefit  lies 
with the  process. 

Using the Results of an Assessment 

The real value in performing an assessment comes into play 
across several areas. Several of these areas are listed in the 
paragraphs below. 

Culture  Change 

One of the more difficult and most important aspects of 
instilling project management discipline in an organization 
is changing the behavior and habits of the people doing the 
work.  Through the process of performing an assessment, 
the work products  and process that people are using will be 
evaluated and compared to  some best-practice scenarios. 
As this process takes  place,  staff members have the 

- 

15 

Describing Project Managemen t  Ma tu r i ty 

opportunity to identify with the logic in the new processes 
and gain an initial understanding of what project 
management has to  offer. Thus culture change starts to take 
place with the start of the initial assessment. Staff members 
begin to realize that they need to think differently than they 
have in the past. In many cases, individuals already know 
that change is necessary. They’re just not sure in what 
direction change should occur. During the interviews 
performed during  an assessment some indication of that 
direction is given to the staff members. 
Another good avenue for starting cultural change is 
the communication of a vision. The results of the 
assessment provide a clear path  and tangible  actions that 
can be implemented for the company to  move forward. 
This information can be communicated across the company 
in an easily understood fashion  to start people thinking in 
new directions. By using the assessment information 
(which is based on information provided by  all  levels of 
employees), staff members become a pa r t of the plan to 
promote change or at least  feel  they have an understanding 
of where the future for the company lies.  This  is one 
starting point to generate interest and enthusiasm to 
improve project management. 

Project  Office  Implementation 

The assessment can help answer another important 
question: What  is the appropriate level of the organization 
a t which to implement a project  office?  The  project  office, 
by definition, is the center of excellence  for  project 
management. Less  clear  is the level of the organization at 
which the center should exist.  This  will depend on the 
degree of maturity that exists within the rest of the 
organization. More mature organizations typically have a 
project  office a t higher levels of the organization than those 

Project Manag em en t  Ma tu r i t y Model 

- 

16 

that are just starting in the project management 
progression. Normally, what we see is that organizations 
who have fairly  well-established  processes  for  project 
management already have competently functioning project 
offices a t Level I (see  Figure 1.4) and are working on their 
implementation of a Level I1 project  office.  Those 
organizations that are very mature will  likely be working 
on enterprise-level project  offices. In each  case, the 
assessment will  reveal the actions  necessary  to ensure 
success in the next step of the project  office implementation. 
In  all of the above cases,  it  will  become evident that the 
ownership for improving project management within the 
organization must rest within a centralized location- 
usually the project  office. 

Repeated/Periodic  Use as a Progress and 
Effectiveness Tool 

We find many of our clients periodically ask themselves: 
“Are we making a difference?” or “Are we advancing the 
project management capability in the right areas, and in 
general?” Recurring use of the assessment can show the 
progress that the project  office  is making toward helping 
the organization reach its goals. This can  become a  part of 
the metrics that are used to measure success of a project 
office on a recurring basis. If the project  office owns  the 
project management capability improvement action, then 
the results of the assessment can be attributed to the actions 
taken by the project  office  to improve project management 
capability. It  is possible to use these measures as the basis 
of incentive rewards. 
Periodic assessments ensure improvements are 
taking root, reinforcing adoption of new ways. Essentially, 
repeated assessments can be used to  track progress against 

- 

17 

Describing Project Manag em en t  Ma tu r i t y 

the project management deployment plan that would be 
developed a s a result of the initial assessment. 

Target  Six-Month  Improvement  Goals 

We often find that organizations want to  use the assessment 
as a tool  to identify specific areas of improvement that 
become goals for the next incremental period of time.  They 
then tackle one area, one level, at a time.  This allows 
organizations to show improvements over a 6-12 month 
period so that the improvement sponsors see a solid ROI. 
Small  victories provide an  opportunity to  cheer  for 
successes and reevaluate specific direction while 
reenergizing staff members. These are important  “peg 
points’’ that allow organizations to  see how much they’ve 
learned, plan for what they didn’t know in the first 
planning session, and  adapt/adjust direction for the next 
short-term (6 months) initiative. 
Another value of the short-term reassessment is that 
it provides a tool  to communicate success and meeting 
milestones to  executives and management. Leadership 
sometimes has a fairly short-range memory, and 
commitment to change initiative budgets can waiver with 
time. 

Setting Your Maturity Goals 

Is Level 5 for  Everyone? 

Level 5 maturity is not for everyone. Each organization 
needs to determine the minimum level of maturity at which 
the return on investment is  achieved and then determine 
the ROI associated with achieving the next level. I t is 
important to realize that these  levels are evolutionary steps. 
We recommend that our clients establish an incremental 

Project Manag em en t  Ma tu r i t y Mod e l 

- 

18 improvement program with specific  focus and measurable 
goals that allow  their organization to realize some benefits 
within a short period of time. We recommend 6-month 
increments, whenever possible. 
We have also found it  beneficial  to maintain project 
management maturity in synch with other corporate 
process maturity, including financial management, 
software engineering, etc. For instance, implementing 
mature project management processes such as earned value 
tracking is meaningless if the organization has not 
implemented time reporting processes.  Experience shows 
that advancing project management practices far ahead of 
other corporate processes  can cause turmoil and mistrust. 

Assessing Your Level 
So, how do you determine where you are currently? There 
are two  kinds of assessments that can be conducted. The 
first assessment approach is the i n d e p e n d e n t  a s s e s s m e n t . 
Project management experts, possessing a strong blend of 
project controls, organizational structure, project 
management, professional development, and management 
skills, plus an in-depth understanding of the PMMM, 
would conduct the assessment. Using a prescribed set of 
tools and processes  (like PM Solutions’ PMMM Assessment 
and HealthCheckSM), these experts would determine your 
organization’s maturity levels in the various knowledge 
areas and present the results to your management team. 
The management team and the assessors would then work 
together to develop your improvement plan. This 
independent approach is the preferred method when an 
external ”expert voice”  is needed to communicate to senior 
executives. 
The second assessment approach is a f a c i l i t a t e d 
a s s e s s m e n t . A small team of experienced assessors would 

- 

19 

Describing Project Manag en l en t M a t u r i t y 

team with representatives from your staff  to conduct a self- 
assessment. Following the same procedures that an 
independent assessment would follow, this team of 
individuals would determine your organization’s maturity 
levels in the various knowledge areas. The  team would 
then work with your management staff  to develop an 
improvement plan to achieve your desired maturity level. 
The primary challenge in the self-assessment approach is 
maintaining the confidentiality of individual findings. The 
assessment fact-finding  activities include staff interviews. 
The quality of the information provided in these interviews 
can be skewed if staff members are not comfortable sharing 
negative information with other staff members. The  self- 
assessment approach can  also  suffer from an inherent bias 
towards a higher level of maturity; no one likes  to hear they 
are at Level 1 maturity. 

Conclusion 

The benefits of a  structured assessment of project 
management maturity lie in setting direction, prioritizing 
actions, and beginning cultural change rather than  in 
understanding the current level at which an organization is 
performing. The emphasis is on ”structured.” I t is 
important that the assessment itself be repeatable, provide 
consistent measurements and results, and provide for some 
degree of benchmarking with other organizations. This 
provides the basis  for any assessment to be utilized as a 
“checkup” tool to measure progress, and to identify the 
next  logical steps forward. Like  it or not, maturity 
assessments may be here to s tay in this complex  project 
management world we live in-not  too distant or different 
from the software development world  and SEI’S CMM.

CHAPTER 2 

Definitions  of Maturity 

LEVELS IN the PM Solutions Project Management 
Model are a s follows: 

Level 1: Initial Process 

Although there is a recognition that there are project 
management processes, there are no established 
practices  or standards, and individual project 
managers are not held to  specific accountability by 
any process standards. Documentation is  loose and 
ad hoc. Management understands the definition of a 
project, that there are accepted  processes, and is 
aware of the need for  project management. Metrics 
are informally collected on an ad hoc basis. 

Level 2: Structured Process and Standards 

Many  project management processes  exist in the 
organization, but they are not considered an 
organizational standard. Documentation exists on 
these basic  processes. Management supports the 
implementation of project management, but there is 
neither consistent understanding, involvement, nor 
organizational mandate to  comply  for  all  projects. 

Project Manag em en t  Ma tu r i t y Model 

- 

24 

Functional management is involved in the project 
management of larger, more visible  projects, and 
these are typically  executed in a systematic fashion. 
There are basic  metrics  to  track  project  cost, 
schedule, and technical  performance, although data 
may be collected/correlated manually. Information 
available for managing the project  is often a mix 
between summary-level data  and detail-level data. 

Level 3: Organizational Standards and 
Institutionalized Process 

All project management processes are in place and 
established a s organizational standards. These 
processes involve the clients a s active and integral 
members of the project team. Nearly all projects  use 
these processes with minimal exception- 
management has institutionalized the processes and 
standards with formal documentation existing on all 
processes and  standards. Management is regularly 
involved in input  and  approval of key  decisions and 
documents and in key  project issues. The  project 
management processes are typically automated. 
Each  project  is evaluated and managed in light of 
other projects. 
Important note: At  Level 3, the processes must 
become  tailorable  to the characteristics of each 
project. An organization cannot blindly apply all 
processes equally to  all  projects. Consideration must 
be given to the differences between projects.  The 
important thing is  to note how the processes are 
tailored-that  is,  is there a process  to customize the 
implementation of applicable processes/policies to a 
particular project? 

Definitions ofMaturity Levels 

Level 4: Managed Process 

25 

Projects are managed with consideration a s to how 
the project  performed  in  the past and what is 
expected  for  the future. Management  uses  efficiency 
and effectiveness  metrics  to  make  decisions 
regarding 
the project and understands the impacts  on other 
projects.  All  projects,  changes, and issues are 
evaluated based upon metrics  from  cost  estimates, 
baseline  estimates, and earned value calculations. 
Project  information  is integrated with other corporate 
systems to  optimize  business  decisions.  Processes and 
standards are documented and in  place  to support 
the practice of using such  metrics  to  make  project 
decisions.  Management  clearly understands its role in 
the project  management  process and executes  it  well, 
managing at the right  level, and clearly  differentiating 
management  styles and project  management 
requirements for  different sizes/complexities of 
projects.  Project  management  processes, standards, 
and supporting systems are integrated with other 
corporate processes and systems. 

Level 5: Optimizing Process 
Processes are in  place and actively used to improve 
project management activities.  Lessons learned are 
regularly examined and used to improve project 
management processes, standards,  and 
documentation. Management and the organization 
are focused not only on effectively managing 
projects but also on continuous improvement. The 
metrics  collected during project  execution are used 
not only to understand the performance of a project 
but also  for making organizational management 
decisions for the future.

CHAPTER 3 

Project Integration 
Management 

T HE PURPOSE OF project integration management is  to (1) 
coordinate project  activities and integrate all  efforts into 
a project plan; (2) integrate, analyze, and report the project 
results in carrying out the project plan; (3) control changes 
to the baseline plan; and (4) collect, integrate, and organize 
project information in a project information system. 

Components 

Project  Plan  Development 

Project plan development integrates planning 
information from the other knowledge areas to 
create a project plan. The  project plan  provides a 
roadmap for  project  execution and is the integration 
vehicle that ensures all  project management areas 
are addressed, developed, and managed within the 
context of the project.  The outcome of this 
component is a project plan. 

Project  Plan  Execution 

Project plan execution  is performing the work by 
carrying out the project plan. During project 

Project Managemen t  Ma tu r i ty  Mode l 

- 

28 

execution, work progress is examined from the 
perspective of each knowledge area  (i.e.,  scope,  time, 
cost, quality, etc.). The status  and performance of the 
project from the perspective of each knowledge area 
is consolidated and integrated into progress reports. 
The main product of this component is information 
on the work results, usually depicted in project 
status  and performance reports. 

Change  Control 

Change control involves managing the project 
baseline. Change control includes implementing a 
change control system (to include configuration 
management), identifying and assessing changes to 
the baseline, coordinating the changes across the 
knowledge areas, managing the authorized changes, 
informing stakeholders, and identifying corrective 
actions. The main products from this component 
include change requests, updates to the project plan, 
corrective  actions, and lessons learned. 

Project  Information System 

This component covers the project’s information 
system that collects, integrates, and organizes 
project-related information, tools,  processes, and 
procedures across the knowledge areas. The main 
product of this component is information about the 
project that is readily accessible  to  all stakeholders. 
Note, this includes manual-based systems. 

Special  Interest  Component-Project Office 

The  project  office  is an ”office”  staffed  by  project 
management professionals who serve their 
organization’s project management needs. In 

- 

29 

Pro jec t  In tegra t ion  Managemen t 

particular, this office provides project management 
support services, provides project management 
consulting/mentoring, develops and maintains 
project management methodologies/standards, 
trains project managers within the organization, and 
supplies project managers for  major  project 
initiatives. 
The  project  office  can make the lives of 
project team members easier  by providing support 
in the areas of project scheduling, report production 
and distribution, operation of project management 
software, maintenance of the visibility  room, and 
maintenance of the project workbook. The types of 
activities that can reasonably be expected from a 
project  office include: 

Consulting/Mentoring 

As organizations mature in project management, the 
project  office  satisfies an increasing need for internal 
project management consultants. These people will 
provide the organization with the expert insights it 
needs to  execute  projects  effectively. 

Processes/Standards 

The  project  office  is the unit within the organization 
that develops and promulgates common 
methodologies and  standards relating to  project 
management. 

Training 

The  project  office trains project managers, team 
members, and clients regarding project management 
principles, tools, and techniques. Both training 
materials and instructors originate in the project 
office.

The project  office  can house a group of professional 
project managers who can be assigned to carry out 
the organization’s projects. 

Project  Management Software Tools 

As the project  office matures it  becomes the focal 
point in the organization for software tools 
supporting the project management effort. 

Project lntegration Managemen t 

Level 1 

Initial Process 

There is  recognition of the need for  accepted  processes, but 
there are no established practices or standards. Individual 
teams or parts of the organization may have their own way 
of doing things in an ad hoc, informal fashion. 
Documentation of the processes  is  loose and makes it 
difficult  to repeat the activities elsewhere. Management is 
aware of the importance of project integration on an ad hoc 
basis and asks for information on work results. 

Project  Plan  Development 

Some  project managers have developed individual 
versions of project plans on an ad hoc  basis; thus 
each plan looks different with varying amounts of 
content and levels of detail. If a project plan exists,  it 
may include a scope statement and work breakdown 
structure (WBS) that consists of a basic set of 
milestones and, occasionally, deliverables. The plan 
may include independent milestones and key 
resource requirements. 

Project  Plan  Execution 

Assignment of work is informal and is  typically 
through verbal communications. The information on 
work results is developed on  an  ad hoc  basis, in 
response to specific requests. 

Change  Control 

Changes are communicated in an ad hoc manner to 
the project manager and, in some cases, directly to 
the team without project manager awareness/ 

Project Manag em en t  Ma tu r i t y Model 

- 

32 

involvement. The  project manager sometimes 
documents them. There  is no documented change 
control process and individual project teams are 
applying their own approach to managing and 
controlling change. Changes are unequally managed 
and, in many cases, not monitored. Functional, 
physical, and data configuration control is  loosely 
managed and controlled, if at all. 

Project Information System 

There is no system that collects, integrates, and 
organizes project-related information tools, 
processes, and procedures across knowledge areas. 
Each project manager uses whatever system she or 
he desires. 

Project  Office 

An informal project  office may exist that generally 
consists of one or two people who have an interest 
in bringing project management standards to the 
organization and  are acknowledged as successful 
project managers. This  is a very basic  project office- 
basically in name only. More  often, a project  office 
does not exist at all. 

Project  Support 

Assistance  is  available from the project  office  to 
project teams on scheduling of projects. 

Consulting/Mentoring 

No help is available within the organization. 

Processes/Standards 

Each project manager manages his or her project in 
the manner he or she desires. 

Project ln tegra t ion  Managemen t 

Training 

No formalized training is  available. If training is 
requested, individuals are directed to seek outside 
sources. 

Project Management 

Guidance on  project management concepts may be 
available to individuals upon request. 

Project Management Software Tools 

Each  project manager uses whatever scheduling tool 
and methodology she or he desires. There is  no tool 
commonality in the organization.

Level 2 

Structured  Process and Standards 

There are basic, documented processes  in  place  for 
developing project plans and integrating, analyzing, and 
developing the reports on work results. Summary-level 
information is consolidated into reports. The  focus  is  on 
summary  status  and performance reporting for the triple 
constraint items (scope,  time, cost). Although the processes 
are in place, they are not considered an organizational 
standard. Management supports the efforts and is involved 
on large, highly visible  projects. 

Project  Plan  Development 

The organization has  a documented process  for 
developing a project plan. At this point, the project 
plan incorporates a project charter, scope statement, 
and top-level WBS. The plan also includes a 
summary-level cost estimate and schedule with 
major milestones. The plan includes key resource 
requirements and identified risks, as well as a list of 
key stakeholders and a communication strategy with 
those key individuals. The plan includes basic  staff 
management items such as time reporting and 
vacation request procedures. The  project plans are 
updated to  reflect approved scope changes from the 
change control process. 

Project  Plan  Execution 

Summary-level information on work results is 
developed. Both status  and performance reports are 
produced tracking progress toward achieving 
scheduled milestones. Technical status information 

Project ln tegra t ion  Managemen t 

is integrated with the cost and schedule information 
to depict the project status. Basic metrics (such as 
planned budget, milestone percent complete) are 
collected and integrated into project performance 
reports. 

- 

35 

Change  Control 

There is a defined and documented change control 
process  for scope changes. For large and highly 
visible  projects, scope changes are identified with a 
change request form, tracked on a change request 
log, are formally approved,  and project plans  are 
updated  and corrective actions incorporated, if 
necessary. Cost and schedule changes are not yet 
controlled since  baselines are not yet common 
practice nor established as an organizational 
standard. Functional,  physical, and data 
configuration is documented and maintained. Large, 
highly visible  projects are required to use the 
principles of change control. 

Project Information System 

There is a basic  project system that collects, 
integrates, and organizes project-related information 
tools,  processes, and procedures across knowledge 
areas for large and highly visible  projects.  The 
system may  be something a s simple a s a central file 
system. There  are guidelines for acceptable 
information systems for individual project teams, 
but the responsibility for selection/ deployment lies 
with the project managers.

36 Project  Office 

A basic  project  office  is established and recognized 
by upper management as having the responsibility 
to define the processes and  standards by which 
projects should be managed. The individuals within 
the project  office (sometimes a part-time 
responsibility) advise and offer input  when asked. 

Project  Support 

The  project  office assists project teams in the creation 
and maintenance of their  project workbooks. 
Assistance  is  offered to project teams on developing 
scope,  project scheduling, and issue and change 
control, upon request. 

Consulting/Mentoring 

On major  projects the project  office  is asked to 
provide personal consulting and mentoring to 
project managers on project initiation and  planning 
processes. 

Processes/Standards 

The  project  office has  put in place a basic  project 
management process;  it  is not considered an 
organizational standard,  and only large or highly 
visible  projects are using it. 

Training 

Basic project management concepts training is made 
available to project managers. 

Project Management 

A database of all  project managers in the 
organization is maintained, along with their 
experience and skill set. 

Project Integration  Management 

Project Management Software Tools 

There is an accepted  project management scheduling 
tool as a guideline; however, the responsibility for 
project management tool selection/deployment lies 
with the project managers.

Level 3 

Organizational Standards and 
Institutionalized Process 

Additional processes are developed and documented for 
creating project plans, reporting information on work 
results, controlling changes, and evolving the project 
information system. There  is a coordinated effort within the 
organization to have a common information system set up 
for individual project  teams.  The  project management 
processes are considered standard practice  for  projects. 
Management supports project management and is  actively 
involved-particularly on large, visible  projects. 
Management monitors status, performance, and changes 
and  responds with corrective  actions, as required. Systems 
are becoming more integrated: the project information 
systems are integrated with the project  office. Management 
fully supports project integration efforts and has 
institutionalized the procedures and  standards related to 
integration activities. 

Project  Plan  Development 

The  project  plan  development  process  is  fully 
documented and implemented within the 
organization. The  organization’s  process  for 
developing project  plans  incorporates  management 
plans (procedures, processes,  etc.)  from  cost, 
schedule,  risk,  quality,  procurement, 
communications, and human resources (staff 
management and staff development). In addition to 
management plans for  each  knowledge  area,  project 
plans will  typically include specific  scope,  time,  cost, 
and risk  information a t an appropriate level of detail. 
For example, the project plans will include the project 

- 

39 

Pro jec t  In tegra t ion  Managemen t 

charter,  scope  statement, and WBS (possibly down to 
level three). The  plan  will  also include cost  estimates 
and schedule information at the  level needed for 
visibility and control.  The plan includes the  cost and 
schedule  baseline.  The plan identifies key resource 
requirements from  the staff management plan. The 
plan  identifies  risks and planned mitigation 
strategies, as appropriate, and includes a list of key 
stakeholders and the communication strategy with 
those  key individuals. The  project plans are updated 
to  reflect approved project  changes  from the change 
control  process. Program plans are developed for 
common,  related  projects. 

Project  Plan  Execution 

Summary and detail-level  information  on  work 
results  is integrated and analyzed, and reports are 
developed. Status and performance reports are 
produced addressing items  such a s technical 
performance of the project,  time spent on project 
activities, and the amount of hours or dollars spent. 
These reports will include informal  variance and 
performance measurement analysis.  (Note:  At  this 
point, the actuals are estimated  by  project  teams as 
opposed to  being  extracted  from corporate finance/ 
accounting  systems.)  Report  templates  may  exist.  The 
status and performance reports include information 
from  knowledge areas such as risk,  quality, human 
resource, and procurement management (in addition 
to  scope,  time, and cost).  Metrics are collected  from 
the  knowledge  areas and integrated into project 
performance reports.

40 Change  Control 

There  is a defined and documented project  change 
control  system  that  incorporates  the  change  control 
processes  for  scope,  cost, and schedule.  The  process 
includes the  change  control  form and change log. The 
project  change  control  system and processes are 
implemented and utilized  by the project  teams 
(changes are identified,  assessed,  coordinated, 
managed, stakeholders are informed, and corrective 
action  is taken). The  process  is documented, 
repeatable, and project  plan updates are consistently 
incorporated with corrective  actions and approved 
changes.  Baselines are established, adhered to, and 
managed. 

Project  Information System 

There  is a central  project  system  that  collects, 
integrates, and organizes  project-related  information 
tools,  processes, and procedures  across  knowledge 
areas.  The  systems  are  becoming standardized across 
projects and may  encompass a central  file  system and 
project  workbooks.  The  project  office  provides 
guidance and coordinates  the  selection and 
implementation of project  management  systems. 

Project  Office 

Functions and services of the project  office are 
defined and communicated to the organization. The 
project  office  is considered b y most  project 
managers as a reference site and an overseer of 
project management methodology. It  is considered 
by organizational management as the focal point of 
the project management thrust for the organization. 
There is a comprehensive standardized project 
management methodology in  place and project  team 

- 

41 

Project ln tegra t ion  Managemen t 

resources are being actively trained in its usage. The 
project  office  is an accepted part of the 
organizational project management landscape. It  is 
integrally involved with the project managers in the 
organization. 

Project Support 

The  project  office  closely monitors the issue and 
change control systems and is consulted on crucial 
change (scope) decisions on large, highly visible 
projects.  The  project  office monitors risk analysis on 
large, highly visible  projects and is involved in the 
risk analysis and control processes on these projects. 
Assistance  is  offered  on  project resource and cost 
estimating. The  project office offers assistance to 
project teams in preparing project performance 
reports  and closely monitors time reporting to 
projects. All support roles (schedulers, etc.) report to 
the line organization. The  project  office  offers 
assistance to  project teams upon request in 
preparing schedule and progress reports. 

Consulting/Mentoring 

The  project  office works closely with the project 
teams of major  projects in the planning process.  This 
assistance is also  available  to smaller projects upon 
request. 

Processes/Standards 

The  project management methodology is enhanced 
with templates and samples for project management 
deliverables. The  project  office  actively works with 
the project managers to ascertain the best practices 
for the organization; they are documented in the 
project management methodology. The  project  office 

Project Manag em en t  Ma tu r i t y Mod e l

provides quality standards  and processes.  There  is 
a 
project management guide in place that provides a 
reference  for  project managers on the entire life  cycle 
of managing a project.  It integrates with the more 
basic  process already in  place and the templates/ 
samples in place.  The  project  office  is involved in 
regular quality walk-throughs and checks 
throughout the project  life  cycle 

Training 
Project management essentials training is considered 
mandatory for  project managers and is made 
available to  project team members. 

Project  Management 
The  project  office  is consulted for the assignment of 
project managers to  major  projects.  The  project  office 
works closely with the project managers on  major 
projects.  The  project  office has an initial, generic 
resource listing (labor categories) in place  for the use 
of project teams. Resource leveling is performed at 
the project  level. 
There is  concern about balancing and 
scheduling key resource usage at an organizational 
level, but no such tools are in place, so this is done 
manually, if at all. 

Project  Management  Software  Tools 
The project  office provides guidance and 
coordinates the selection and implementation of 
project management software tools-project 
managers in the organization are involved in tool 
selection. 

Project Integration  Management 

Level 4 

Managed Process 

All  processes are in place, documented, and being utilized 
by all  projects.  Processes and  standards are integrated with 
other corporate processes and systems. Integration includes 
incorporating project plans and program plans into 
organization strategic plans. In addition, the reporting 
process and project information system are integrated with 
the project  office, finance/accounting, strategic planning 
systems, and risk management process. There is a  mandate 
to  comply with the organizational project management 
processes and procedures. Management takes an 
"organizational view" of projects.  Projects are managed 
with consideration as to how the project performed in the 
past and what is  expected  for the future. Management uses 
efficiency and effectiveness  metrics  to make decisions 
regarding the project.  All  projects,  changes, and issues are 
evaluated based upon metrics from cost estimates, baseline 
estimates, and earned value calculations.  The  metrics are 
used to understand the performance of a project during 
execution  for making management decisions for  the  future. 

Project  Plan  Development 

All  processes are in place, documented, and being 
utilized. Project plans  and program plans are 
integrated into  and  support organization strategic 
plans. Data from project plans feed into financial 
and other organizational systems to complement 
business execution.

process  is integrated with the project  office, finance/ 
accounting, strategic planning systems, and risk 
management systems. Formal variance and 
performance measurement analysis is conducted 
and  reported. (Note: At this point, the actuals are 
extracted from corporate finance/accounting 
systems.) Metrics are collected from the knowledge 
areas and integrated into project performance 
reports. 

Change Control 

All change control processes are in  place, 
documented, and being utilized. The  project change 
control process,  to include configuration 
management, is integrated with the organization’s 
control systems, monitoring programs, and risk 
management process.  Functional,  physical, and data 
configuration is  consistently documented, 
maintained, managed, and controlled for  all 
projects. 

Project  Information  System 

The central project system collects, integrates, and 
organizes project-related information tools, 
processes, and procedures across knowledge areas. 
The systems are standardized across  projects and 
are integrated with the project  office and other 
corporate systems, as applicable. Data require 
minimal manual effort in moving from, and to, the 
project manager. 

Pro jec t  In tegra t ion  Managemen t 

Project Office 
Project management best practices are collected  by 
functional area and maintained at the project  office. 
Realistic management-level reporting is in place. 
"Ego-less" reviews of major  projects are regularly 
done against standard methodologies and processes. 
Realistic resource projections are done by the project 
office.  There are few surprises on projects. 

Project Support 
The  project  office  is  responsible  for 
the organizational 
skill  inventory  database,  coordination of the 
assignments of critical  resources,  organizational 
resource  leveling, and resource  projections  (also 
involved  in the requisition of additional/replacement 
resources).  The  project  office provides project-level 
variance  analyses  to  organizational management. 
They  also  design and produce executive dashboard 
management reporting on  all approved projects.  The 
project  office maintains visibility  rooms  for  all  major 
projects, and possibly a room(s) for smaller  projects  to 
share. The  project  office determines the project report 
consolidation  process  for  management reporting and 
is  responsible  for carrying it out on a regular cycle. 

Consulting/Mentoring 

There is a project audit process in place.  Projects that 
are in trouble are immediately put into a project 
recovery  process that is managed by the project 
office. A formal mentoring process  is in place, 
whereby all project managers are mentored at some 
point.

Processes/Standards 

The  project management methodology is now a 
standard. All projects are expected  to  use these 
processes as their normal operating process. A 
central project documentation repository is in place 
and  is actively monitored by the project  office. 
Projects are required to utilize this repository. The 
project  office conducts benchmarking of selected 
projects  to ascertain estimate accuracy and improve 
estimating techniques. 

Training 

Advanced project management topics are 
considered mandatory for  project  managers-a 
training plan, tied into the career plan, is created for 
each  project manager. Project management 
essentials training is made available to  project 
managers. Advanced project management topics are 
made available  to  project managers. Project 
management essentials training is mandatory before 
a project manager manages a project and is 
suggested for all team members. 

Project  Management 

Performance reviews of project managers are done 
jointly by the line organization and the project  office. 
There is an accurate resdurce repository in  place; the 
project  office  is responsible for maintenance of this 
information, which is used for organizational 
resource projections.  The  project managers report to 
the line organization; however, there is a dotted-line 
responsibility to the project  office.  Regular status 
reports go to both the line organization and the 
project  office. There may  be a small cadre of senior 
project managers who report to the project  office.

Project Integration  Management 

They manage the more complex,  visible  projects  for 
the organization. The  project  office provides input to 
the line manager for the project  manager’s 
performance review. The  project  office  is responsible 
for the acquisition and  updating of resource 
information (especially  for  key resources), and this 
process has begun. The  project  office manually ties 
in resource leveling to resource availability a t an 
organizational level.  The  project  office  is responsible 
for integrating project performance reports into the 
consolidated report, which  is sent into the 
management oversight process. 

Project  Management Software Tools 

Since estimates are now being entered for  all 
projects, the project  office  is capturing estimated and 
actual costs.  The  project  office drives the selection of 
project management software tools, soliciting input 
from the line organization. The  project  office  is 
responsible for deploying project management 
software tools.  The  project management software 
tool has resource repository information.

includes efficiency and effectiveness considerations. 
A process utilizing such metrics for management 
decisions during project  execution  is developed, 
documented, and in place.  Lessons learned are being 
captured in a repository. 
An improvement process  is in place to 
continuously improve the project change control 
process  to include configuration management. 
Lessons learned are captured and used to improve 
the monitoring and control efforts. Historical 
changes on projects are examined to identify trends 
in change control actions and improve upon the 
initial project planning process. 

Project Information System 

An improvement process is in place  to continuously 
improve the project information system. Lessons 
learned are captured and used to improve the 
project systems. The  project information systems 
support the collection and organization of project 
efficiency and effectiveness metrics. In addition, the 
system employed to  collect, integrate, and organize 
project information becomes more efficient and 
effective. 

Project  Office 

The  project  office manages the project portfolio, 
provides project management tools and training, 
and oversees scoping of projects.  Project managers 
are significantly accountable to the project  office. 

Project Managemen t  Ma tu r i ty Model 

- 

50 

The  project  office  is 
responsible for organization- 
wide resource leveling and assignment of critical 
resources. The  project  office has processes  in  place  to 
capture lessons learned from  projects completed, 
and modifies  project management methodologies a s 
a result. Projects are measured against best practices. 
Lessons learned are captured and  applied. Project 
management is now thoroughly accepted as the 
standard practice throughout the organization. 

Project Support 

There is a project management help desk function 
available from the project  office.  The  project  office  is 
involved in the closure process of every major 
project (and many smaller ones). The  project  office 
provides, as part of management reporting, full-cost 
tracking, including what is  necessary for earned 
value calculations by  project. 
Lessons learned are captured and  used. 
Additionally, customer satisfaction surveys of 
project  office support are conducted and 
improvement areas identified and acted on. 

Consulting/Mentoring 

The  project  office staff coaches  project managers in 
the managing of smaller  projects within the 
organization. The  project  office works closely with 
project managers and business clients on business 
analysis and proposal preparation for  major  project 
initiatives. 

Processes/Standards 

A process is  in  place whereby project management 
methodologies are improved as better practices are 
discovered. All  project management methodologies, 

- 

51 

Project lntegration M a t l a g e nm t 

processes, and  templates/samples are available on 
the Intranet. The  project  office maintains an internal 
web site. 

Training 

An evaluation is made at the end of every major 
project  to ascertain weak skill areas. This 
information is used to  bolster training plans for 
individuals on the project and to create changes to 
existing training courses (and, occasionally, new 
courses). Full training program is  available, leading 
to  certification as a Project Management Professional 
( PM P ) . Project management essentials training is 
considered mandatory for  project managers, and is 
suggested for  all  client personnel who will  be 
involved in projects. 

Project Management 

The  project manager works closely with the line 
organization to anticipate new programs  and 
projects on the horizon. There is an active program 
for  feedback  from all parts of the organization for 
project management improvements. Many  project 
managers in the organization report to the project 
office, with dotted-line responsibility to the line 
organization. The  project  office does performance 
reviews of project managers with  input from the line 
organization. 
Project managers are well integrated into the 
client organization (although they may report to the 
project  office) and are considered part of the client 
management teams. 
Resource leveling is done in an automated 
fashion a t the organizational level. 

Project Manag em en t  Ma tu r i t y Model

5 2 

Project Management Software Tools 

On every project, part of the closure  process is to 
review the project management software tools and 
their interfaces  to ascertain improvements. These 
lessons learned are regularly integrated back into 
the tools/interfaces through a  standard process. 
The  project management software tool 
provides earned value reporting, which the project 
office has made a part of the executive dashboard 
reporting. The resource repository is now integrated 
with  the  human resource system for the 
organization. The  project management software tool 
is integrated with the corporate accounting system 
for budgeting  and cost reporting and with the 
organizational procurement system for obtaining 
actual costs of goods and services. 

CHAPTER 4 

Project  Scope 
Management 

S COPE MANAGEMENT CONSISTS of the processes required to 
ensure that the project includes all the work required, 
and only the work required, to complete the project 
successfully.  Scope management has the components listed 
below. 

Components 

Requirements Definition (Business) 

This is the assessment and development of 
processes, procedures, and  standards relating to the 
collection of the business-related requirements of 
projects. 

Requirements Definition (Technical) 

This is the assessment and development of 
processes, procedures, and standards relating to the 
collection of the technical requirements of projects.  It 
has to do with how business requirements are 
translated into technical requirements. 

Project M a n a g em e n t  M a t w i t y Model 

- 

54 Deliverables  Identification 

This  is the process established to identify project 
deliverables. Stakeholder involvement is described 
(client, management, etc.), and mapping to the 
original business request is covered. 

Scope Definition 

This involves the processes in place  for the 
definition of project  scope, assumptions, and 
constraints. Are they formal or informal? Do these 
processes cause the project  scope  to be well defined? 
Are  projects always begun with  a project charter? 
Are scope, assumptions, and constraints regularly 
tracked for  projects? 

Work  Breakdown Structure 

This covers the process  for the development of a 
work plan, the quality, quantity, and overall 
sophistication of the organization’s use of the WBS. 
Do they develop a WBS dictionary? Does the WBS 
form the basis  for the automated plan? Is the WBS 
tied  to the accounting system for reporting 
purposes? 

Scope Change  Control 

This  section  covers the change management 
processes as they relate  to  project scope. It  covers the 
regularity of use and the overall evaluation of 
proposed changes. Are changes really evaluated/ 
prioritized or are they merely listed? Is the change 
management process  tied into the issues tracking 
system? Is there regular follow-up and  reporting? Is 
the change management process  closely  tied  to the 
organizational management process? 

Project Scope Managemen t 

Level 1 

Initial Process 

- 

55 

There is a very general statement of business requirements 
that is reduced to a requirements list by the project team. 
Documentation and management of all elements (issues, 
changes, etc.) is very loose and ad hoc. Although there is  an 
awareness of the need for managing project  efforts, there 
are no  standards in the organization for  project 
management. Management is  generally aware of the scope 
of the initiatives, but typically  is only aware to the point of 
definition of a few  key  milestones. 

Requirements Definition (Business) 

Business requirements are only a statement of 
purpose--”this  is what we think we need.” 

Requirements  Definition (Technical) 

Technical requirements/deliverables are 
documented for  projects;  those deliverables have 
some general definition of what will be produced if 
these deliverables are met. 

Deliverables Identification 

Deliverables are documented only by naming them 
(perhaps a bulleted list). 

Scope Definition 

Generally a statement of scope is prepared on a 
project. However, the format and content of this 
statement are ad hoc-that  is, 
there are no standards 
for such, and each one looks different. 

Project Manag em en t  Ma tu r i t y Model 

- 
56 Work  Breakdown  Structure 

The WBS consists of a very basic set of identified 
work to be accomplished, and occasionally 
deliverables (may not truly be a decomposition of 
the project, but more of a listing). The  project  may 
have a schedule, but that schedule has  no real basis 
in work to be performed, and there are no specific 
guidelines as to how the work plan or schedule 
should be developed. 

Scope Change  Control 

Changes are communicated in an ad hoc manner to 
the project manager, who sometimes documents 
them. There is no documented scope change control 
process. 

Project Scope Managen len t 

Level 2 

57 

Structured  Process and Standards 

There is a basic  project management scope process in  place. 
There is a process  to involve management in the project 
scope management process, but not all management is 
participating in this process.  Many of the projects  in the 
organization are utilizing the standard project management 
process  to identify and manage project scope. 
Organizational management is involved in  project 
management processes  on the larger, more visible  projects, 
but there may not be consistent management involvement 
across all  projects, nor an organizational mandate to utilize 
the basic  project management processes  on all projects. 
Management is supporting the project management 
processes and the scope management process in particular. 

Requirements  Definition [Business) 

A documented process  is  in  place by which the 
project manager solicits and receives inputs  and 
develops business requirements. The result is 
documentation for business requirements. There is a 
documented process  in  place by which the project 
manager seeks/receives management sign-offs 
(from either individual manager or management 
team) to approve the business requirements. 

Requirements  Definition  (Technical) 

Deliverables have some quantitative/qualitative 
basis behind them-that  is, 
the deliverables should 
be performed in a specific way. There is a basic 
process for establishing a base set of deliverables for 
a project.  The  project manager (or team) always 

Project Managemen t  Ma tu r i ty Model 

- 

58 

verifies  project scope (what is  to be included/ 
excluded in project) with the client area. 
Management signs off on the technical aspects/ 
expectations for the planned deliverables; there is 
agreement on how those deliverables will operate 
when produced. 

Deliverables Identification 

There is a process in place by which key deliverables 
are identified and listed. There is a process in place 
requiring management and customer involvement 
in the deliverables identification/approval process. 

Scope Definition 

There is a clearly defined and documented process 
describing the preparation of project charters and 
scope statements, which is  enforced  by 
organizational management for larger, more visible 
projects.  Projects are consistently started with the 
defined project charter; scope statements are 
consistently prepared in accordance with the 
defined process and format. 

Work Breakdown Structure 

There is a basic  process defined that includes a top- 
level WBS template (probably first and second 
levels) showing the organization’s preferred 
primary project work breakdown structure). From 
the second WBS level on, the WBS is structured such 
that it has a built-in codification structure (task 
numbering) so that management reporting can “roll 
up” and take place rather naturally, consistent with 
the organizational requirements. There is a WBS 
template available that goes down to a t least the 

- 

59 

Project Scope Ma l lagenzen t 

third level (the level a t which the structure begins to 
flesh out how each of the product  groups defined in 
the first and second  levels  is  to be delivered-the 
final level in this structure will define the tasks for 
the project). Management reviews and  approves the 
WBS developed for new projects.  Because of 
management’s involvement, many of the projects  in 
the organization that are medium-to-high levels of 
complexity have developed a comprehensive WBS 
for the project.  These WBS structures are used to 
develop the project schedule, and a s a 
communication vehicle with the sponsor, as the 
primary communication vehicle  for the status of the 
project,  etc. 

Scope Change  Control 

There is a defined and documented scope change 
control process, but not all of the projects  follow this 
process. Management supports the documented 
scope change control process and monitors to ensure 
it  is being followed  for larger, more visible  projects. 
For those projects, there is a high degree of 
compliance in following the scope change control 
process.

Level 3 

Organizational Standards and 
Institutionalized Process 

There  is a full, rigorous project  management  process 
documented and standardized for the organization;  this 
process  is  in  use  by  nearly  all 
of the projects.  All  project 
management processes  involve the clients as active and 
integral members of the project  team.  This  team develops 
requirements, scope, and so on. The  team as a unit seeks 
management input and approval of key decisions and 
documents;  management is actively and integrally  involved 
in key  project  decisions and issues.  Stakeholder  management 
is  involved  in the scope  management  process.  The  process 
requires, and management  is  actively participating in,  key 
decisions where they pertain to  project  scope  issues. 

Requirements Definition (Business) 

There is a documented process  in  place that 
specifically prescribes the steps by  which the project 
manager goes about the creation of the business 
requirements. This process involves all stakeholders: 
the business unit, the technical unit(s), other 
supporting organizations, and the client 
organization. This  process  may involve the 
utilization of facilitated rapid application 
development (RAD) techniques where all 
stakeholders come together to  flesh out the business 
requirements, or a more traditional method whereby 
all stakeholders are involved in the analysis process. 
This  process provides for the formation of the 
integrated project team, which is fully responsible 
for the requirements: creation, documentation, full 

Project  Scope Mnnagernent 

understanding, agreement, and sign-off.  The  team 
sign-off  is  followed  by management sign-offs a t the 
business unit level, the technical  level, and the client 
level. 

- 

61 

Requirements  Definition (Technical) 

There is in place a  standard format for  technical 
specifications and  a  standard process  by which these 
specifications are produced. This ”standard process” 
may be a widely recognized  process such as James 
Martin, LBMS, etc., but it  is a detailed process (set of 
steps) through which the specifications  for the 
deliverables are produced. This  process  is used on a 
continuing and ongoing basis. The integrated project 
team has key input into the technical requirements 
and specifications.  This represents an additional  step 
toward an integrated/facilitative process where the 
project  team develops the requirements and 
specifications and thereby is buying into the process 
and its products. 

Deliverables Identification 

A Level 3 organization includes client involvement in 
a facilitated  process, and complete integrated project 
team  involvement  in  the  process of identifying and 
documenting the deliverables.  This  process includes a 
deliverables  dictionary, where the  dictionary 
discusses what each  deliverable  is,  the  scope of each 
deliverable, the expectations of what each  deliverable 
will  achieve, the business or  technical requirement/ 
specification that each  deliverable  will  satisfy.  The 
process must include a documented agreement  by the 
client to this  deliverable  dictionary. 

Project Managemen t  Ma tu r i ty Model 

- 

62 Scope Definition 

Project assumptions and constraints are clearly 
documented in the scope statement. A statement of 
work is created for  each  project with specific 
definition of the work and is approved by 
organizational management. The project scope is 
regularly determined and documented by a fully 
integrated project  team, including the business unit, 
technical groups, strategic groups as necessary, the 
client,  etc. 

Work Breakdown Structure 

The WBS is always determined and documented by 
the fully integrated project team using a facilitated 
process that includes the business unit, technical 
groups, strategic groups as necessary, the client,  etc. 
The WBS is always the basis for determining project 
tasks. Management is involved with development 
and  approval of project WBS. 

Scope  Change Control 

The scope change control system, reporting, and 
analysis processes are followed  by the project teams 
(scope changes/status are being identified, 
evaluated, managed, and stakeholders are 
informed). A performance measurement process is 
developed and documented to evaluate project 
scope status  and take corrective  actions.  The  process 
is documented and repeatable. Baselines are 
established, adhered to, and managed. 

Project Scope Managemen t 

Level 4 

Managed Process 

All  project management processes are in place, being 
actively used on all  projects, and  are the normal (assumed) 
method of performing projects. There is an ”organizational 
view” of all pro jec ts-even from within any single project.

p ro j e c t s . Organizational management: 
Understands its role in the project management process 
Is regularly involved in the project management process 
Manages at  “the right level” (delegating when 
appropriate  and managing at a lower level when 
necessary) 
Holds the project managers and the project teams 
accountable for deployment against a comprehensive 
project management process on appropriate levels of 
projects (that is, on large, complex  projects all steps of the 
project management process should  be performed, all 
project management deliverables created, etc.-but on 
smaller, simpler projects a scaled-down set of steps  and 
deliverables should  be followed) 
Is managing against the improved process, not against the 
basic  process. 

Requirements  Definition  (Business) 

Business requirements are fully documented by the 
project team. The business requirements take careful 
account of other existing functions, systems, and 
other active  projects. If, in the course of deploying 
the project, changes come about that affect the 
business requirements, the change control analysis 

Project Manag em en t  Ma tu r i t y Model 

- 

64 

should include an analysis of impacts on existing 
functions and other active  projects. 

Requirements Definition (Technical) 

Technical requirements/specifications are fully 
documented by the project team, based in part on 
organizational standards. These  specifications are 
created only  after an analysis of ramifications of the 
proposed system on the current technical 
environment, other existing systems (interfaces, as 
well as performance ramifications), and other active 
projects. 

Deliverables  Identification 

Organizational management has  mandated that 
deliverables must be planned and delivered with a 
clear consistent view  to other existing functions, 
systems, and active  projects.  The development of a 
WBS is  closely aligned with deliverable 
identification and documentation. 

Scope Definition 

Scope, assumptions, constraints, and interproject 
dependencies are thoroughly documented and 
actively monitored and managed throughout the 
project. 

Work Breakdown  Structure 

The WBS is included in the change control process. 
The  creation of the WBS is  closely aligned with 
documentation of deliverables. This  process 
identifies that there are acceptable  levels of change 
to the WBS that the project manager can make 

Project Scope Managemen t 

without approval. The  project manager understands 
that WBS changes having impact on scope,  time, or 
cost (or other major  decisions) must  be  approved a t 
the appropriate level of the organization.

Scope Change Control 

All  processes are in place, documented, and being 
utilized. The scope change control system is 
integrated with the organization’s control systems, 
monitoring programs, and risk management 
process. Scope,  cost, and schedule reports are 
integrated with technical status reports.

Level 5 

Optimizing Process 

The organization now has its focus not only on effectively 
managing all  projects, but also  on improving the  manner in 
which future projects  can be managed-that  is,  on  process 
improvements. Projects are managed with high  utilization of 
value  considerations. Effectiveness and efficiency  metrics are 
regularly  calculated and tracked.  There  is a clear 
understanding of a project’s value to the organization;  all 
changes,  issues,  etc.  are evaluated based upon effectiveness 
and efficiency  metrics.  Scope determinations are made/ 
decided at the appropriate level of management,  based upon 
quantitative metrics determined by  the  project  team. 

Requirements  Definition  (Business) 

There is  full change control on business 
requirements. Any  change  is  only initiated if it is 
fully understood and documented; management has 
approval at appropriate levels. Incorporates quality 
assurance techniques. Also incorporates quality 
improvement processes  on an ongoing basis such 
that history is kept on how past projects defined and 
documented business requirements; this history is 
used to determine improvements in the process 
used for understanding  and documenting business 
requirements. Change decisions  for improvements, 
modifications, and additions to business 
requirements should include a judgment as to value: 
dollar impact, time impact, etc. There should be 
value metrics  in  place  for making such decisions.

fully understood and documented; management has 
approval  at  appropriate levels. Incorporates quality 
assurance techniques; incorporates quality 
improvement processes on an ongoing basis. All 
major  projects are examined during the close 
process  to ascertain needed changes to  technical 
standards. There  is a process  in  place whereby these 
changes are regularly incorporated. The decisions 
for any change  in  scope relative to  technical 
requirements/specifications must be based upon a 
value proposition: dollar impact, time impact, some 
value impact. There must  be metrics involved in 
such decisions. 

Deliverables Identification 

There is full change control on deliverables. Any

68 Scope Definition 

The  process of determining and documenting scope 
is regularly examined to ascertain process 
improvements. Experience data from a project 
repository are regularly used to improve upon 
standard templates for scoping and the 
development of requirements. Scope  is regularly 
monitored carefully and projected deviations from 
scope are foreseen and carefully documented. They 
are carefully evaluated based upon value 
propositions (cost/time/value) before the 
determination is made whether o r not to  proceed 
with the deviation. 

Work Breakdown  Structure 

The process of determining WBS and work plans is 
regularly examined (generally at project close-down) 
to ascertain lessons learned regarding process 
improvements. WBS and work plan are regularly 
monitored carefully and projected changes are 
foreseen and carefully documented. They are 
carefully evaluated based upon value propositions 
(cost/time/value) before the determination is made 
whether or not to  proceed with the change. 

Scope Change  Control 

An improvement process  is in place to continuously 
improve the scope control process.  Lessons learned 
are  captured  and used to improve the monitoring 
and control efforts. Metrics are gathered and 
analyzed to ascertain the accuracy of the scoping 
process. Scope variances are incorporated into the 
determination of project  efficiency and effectiveness. 

Project Scope Managemen t 

A process utilizing scope variances and cost 
assessments for management decisions during 
project  execution  is developed, documented, and in 
place.  Lessons learned are being captured.

CHAPTER 5 

Project  Time 
Management 

T” OVERALL PURPOSE of time management is  to develop 
the project schedule, manage to that schedule, and 
ensure the project completes within the approved 
timeframe. Time management involves defining project 
activities, sequencing the activities, developing the 
schedule, executing the schedule, and controlling the plans 
during project  execution. 

Components 

Activity  Definition 

Activity definition involves identifying and 
documenting project activities that must be 
accomplished to produce the product(s) or services 
identified in the work breakdown structure. The 
outcome of this component is a list of all activities 
with any  supporting detail including activity 
definitions, constraints, and assumptions. 

Activity  Sequencing 

Activity sequencing involves sequencing project 
activities and depicting when each product or 

Project Managemen t  Ma tu r i ty  Mode l 

- 

72 

service must be  accomplished 
relative to other 
activities.  Activity sequencing also includes the 
development of dependencies between activities. 
The outcome of this component is a project network 
diagram. 

Schedule Development 

Schedule development involves determining the 
duration  and calculating the start  and finish dates 
for  each  project activity. Using the project network 
diagram, activity durations are established, resource 
requirements are confirmed, a project schedule is 
created, and a baseline schedule is established. This 
component includes the development of a schedule 
management plan. The main products from 
schedule development include the project schedule 
and  a schedule management plan. 

Schedule  Control 

Schedule control involves managing the schedule 
baseline to ensure the project completes within the 
approved timeframe. Managing the schedule 
baseline involves implementing a schedule control 
system, publishing schedule status reports, 
analyzing schedule performance metrics, 
determining changes to the schedule baseline, 
managing the authorized changes, informing 
stakeholders, and taking corrective action. The main 
products  from this component include schedule 
reports, schedule performance analyses, and revised 
schedule baselines. 

Project Time Mnnagenzen t 

Schedule Integration 

Schedule integration involves the integration of 
major components of project schedules. Schedules 
are integrated throughout the organization to 
accurately understand the impact of change. 
Program schedules reflect the integration of projects 
within a program to  accurately understand the 
impact of project changes on the overall program. 
The main products of this component are integrated 
project, program, and organizational schedules. 

Project Managemen t  Ma tu r i ty Model 

Level 1 

Initial Process 

There is  recognition of accepted  processes, but there are no 
established practices or standards. Individual teams or 
parts of the organization may have their own way of doing 
things in an ad hoc, informal fashion. Documentation of the 
processes  is  loose and makes it  difficult  to repeat the 
activities elsewhere. Management is aware of the 
importance of time management and  has periodically asked 
for schedule metrics. 

Activity Definition 

Generally, a scope statement is prepared for  projects 
and the work breakdown structure consists of a 
basic set of milestones and occasionally deliverables. 
The  project schedule is at the milestone  level. Few or 
no activities are defined to  achieve the milestones. 
Key milestones for functional support areas are 
sometimes overlooked. The way things are done  is 
ad hoc, not documented, and varies by project 
(milestones are not standard). 

Activity  Sequencing 

Project  activities are sequenced on an  ad hoc  basis, if 
at all. If project  activities are sequenced, they seldom 
reflect dependencies. Individual project teams may 
have access  to and  understand sequencing methods, 
but they are not standardized  throughout the 
organization. Network diagrams with dependencies 
do not usually exist. 

Schedule Development 

- 

75 

There  is no organizational process (only an  ad hoc 
approach) for developing a schedule that includes 
using the network diagram, determining activity 
durations, identifying and prioritizing resources, 
developing the schedule, and baselining the project. 
Schedule development is ad hoc and is  typically 
limited to independent milestones. Durations 
between milestones are rough guesses. Project 
managers have developed their own way of 
identifying resources and quantities needed. There 
is an  ad hoc approach to finding who is available to 
work on projects. No help is available from the 
project  office in developing the schedule or 
identifying a scheduling tool.  Project teams and 
segments of the organization may have varying 
ways of developing a schedule baseline using 
milestones. There is no tool commonality in the 
organization. 

Schedule  Control 

Individual project teams and segments of the 
organization are applying their own  approach to 
managing and controlling schedules. Schedule 
milestone changes are unequally managed and, in 
many cases, not monitored, and changes seldom 
involve corrective actions. Ad hoc schedule reports 
are provided upon request. Schedule performance 
(metrics) is tracked using inconsistent and 
nonstandard practices.

Occasionally, there is an informal ad hoc grouping 
of project schedules for umbrella program schedules 
or integrated organization schedules. On request, 
individuals group together project schedules to 
depict program milestone status  and organization- 
wide accomplishments.

Structured  Process and Standards 

There are basic, documented processes in place for 
identifying project  activities, sequencing the activities and 
establishing dependencies, developing summary schedules, 
publishing and distributing reports, and monitoring basic 
schedule metrics. Although the processes are in place, they 
are not considered an organizational standard. Basic 
metrics  exist  for schedule information (milestone percent 
complete) although they may be collected and correlated 
manually. Additional processes are developed and 
documented for  activity definition, schedule development, 
and managing and controlling the schedule. A mix of 
summary  and detailed information is developed and 
collected.  Project management processes are considered 
standard practice  for large, visible  projects. All documented 
processes are repeatable. Management supports project 
management, but they are only consistently involved on 
large, visible  projects. 

Activity Definition 

Generally, a scope statement is prepared  and  a scope 
process exists; however, management does not 
require adherence to the process. Summary activities 
are defined for near-term and long-term efforts. 
There is a basic, documented process  for defining 
activities with standard milestones/exit criteria 
established for  projects.  Large, highly visible 
projects are using the basic  process, WBS template, 
and  standard milestones/exit criteria. Scope 
statements are prepared  as  standard practice on 
large,  visible  projects.  There  is a WBS template that 

Project Mnnagenrent Ma tu r i t y Model 

- 

78 

goes down to a t least  level 
three. The  project 
schedule is at a detailed level  for large, visible 
projects.  Detailed-level  activities are defined to 
achieve the scope, at least  level three in the WBS, 
milestones, and deliverables. Detailed  activities are 
defined for near-term efforts.  The  activity definition 
process is expanded to  collect historical information 
(activities on similar projects). The  activity definition 
process  is documented and repeatable. The  top-level 
WBS template, an identified set of key milestones/ 
exit criteria, and  the activity definition process are 
standardized for large, visible  projects.  Small 
projects are encouraged to use the process. 

Activity  Sequencing 

The organization has a basic, documented process 
for sequencing activities and establishing 
precedence and dependencies. The  activity sequence 
process includes the formal identification of 
constraints and assumptions that impact the 
sequencing of activities.  The entire process  for 
sequencing activities and establishing precedence 
and dependencies is a standard for large, visible 
projects.  The organization has access  to different 
activity sequencing methods (precedence, arrow, 
and conditional diagramming). Mandatory 
dependencies are identified at a summary level. 
Network diagrams exist at a summary level with 
mandatory dependencies. Both discretionary and 
mandatory dependencies are identified at the 
detailed level. Network diagrams exist a t the 
detailed level with discretionary and  mandatory 
dependencies. 

Schedule Development 

Project T ime  Managemen t

The  basic guidelines represent a full, documented, 
repeatable process  for developing schedules. In 
addition, the process includes the development of a 
historical database to collect data on activity 
durations. A schedule management plan  and 
process is developed and documented. Large, highly 
visible  projects use the processes as a standard,  and 
other projects are encouraged to apply the processes. 
The  project  office  closely monitors and  supports the 
determination of project  activity durations, 
development of schedules, and establishment of 
project  baselines. I t is the norm to have a project 
schedule at a detailed level (showing the level a t 
which the structure begins to  flesh out the 
deliverables for  each product/service  group). To 
calculate durations, project teams rely upon expert 
knowledge and access  to industry methods, 
commercial databases, and  industry  standards  and 
factors. Factors and  standards may include 
capability and resource dedication measures. The 
organization has a complete resource listing, 
industry  standard tools, techniques, and /o r factors 
for  project teams to approximate quantities. Teams 
develop staffing plans and work with line 
management to acquire resources. The resources are 
inserted into the schedule. Cost estimates are used to 
support schedule development. Project risks are 
considered. The organization has a documented 
process for  allocating, timephasing, and baselining a 
project.  Baselines are established, but may change 
frequently. Project management software tools are 
standard for large, visible  projects and integration 
(dependency) is  accomplished within projects.  The 

Project Manag em en t  Ma tu r i t y Model 

- 

80 

organization has access  to different scheduling 
methods: deterministic CPM (specified network 
logic and single duration estimates); probabilistic 
GERT (probabilities in network logic and  duration 
estimates); and weighted average PERT (sequential 
network logic and weighted average duration 
estimates). 

Schedule  Control 

A process  is developed and documented for 
managing and controlling schedules and the concept 
of a schedule change control system is introduced. 
The process includes items such a s schedule 
statusing, a change control form, a change log, and 
an issues log/form. Summary and detailed schedule 
reports are developed and provided to  key 
stakeholders. The schedule reports are produced 
from a central system. Schedules are  statused  and 
tracked using planned versus actuals and milestone 
percent complete. Schedule baselines are 
established, but may change frequently. The 
organization is capable of simple variance analysis 
of schedule status (using planned status versus 
actual status). Metrics are collected such as schedule 
baseline, planned status,  and actual status. 

Schedule Integration 

A t the summary level,  project schedules are 
manually grouped together to depict program 
schedules and organization-wide schedules. There  is 
no attempt to integrate the dependencies and 
relationships within program schedules or the 
organization-wide schedules. At the summary  and 

Project T ime Managemen t 

detailed levels,  project schedules are still manually 
grouped together to depict program schedules and 
organization-wide schedules. Thought is being 
given to integrate program and organization-wide 
schedules. Guidelines to integrate schedules are in 
the early stages of formulation.

Organizational Standards and 
Institutionalized Process 

All processes are in place and documented. The  processes 
are considered an organizational standard  and are being 
utilized by nearly all of the projects.  The activity definition 
process  is expanded to include activity templates. Activity 
sequencing is expanded to include external dependencies 
and activity network templates. The schedule control 
process is expanded to include schedule performance 
analysis. The schedule integration process  is developed and 
implemented with program schedules. Metrics are collected 
and analyzed in areas such as the number of project 
activities, type of external dependencies, duration 
standards, capability factors, resource dedication factors, 
and schedule performance and efficiency. Management 
fully supports the schedule management processes and  has 
institutionalized the procedures and  standards. Processes 
and  standards are integrated with other corporate 
processes and systems. Integration includes organization- 
wide integration of projects with key dependencies 
established and monitored. In addition, the schedule 
development, schedule baselining, and cost control 
processes are integrated with the project  office, finance/ 
accounting, strategic planning systems, and risk 
management process. There is a mandate to comply with 
the organizational project management processes and 
procedures. Management takes an organizational view of 
projects. 

Activity Definition 

- 

83 

Scope statements with project assumptions and 
constraints are an organizational standard for all 
projects.  The WBS is always used as the basis for 
determining project  activities.  This information is 
used to  define  activities. A detailed schedule with 
detailed activities  is the organizational standard 
practice.  Detailed  activities are defined for near-term 
efforts and beyond, if appropriate. Project teams are 
beginning to identify external, dependent activities. 
Historical information on  common  activities  exists, 
and the activity definition process  is expanded to 
include activity templates with definitions specific  to 
the organization. The  activity definition process  is 
documented and repeatable. The  activity templates 
are integrated into the standard scheduling software 
environment. Metrics are being collected such as the 
number of activities per project.  Definition of project 
activities includes key tasks external to the project 
that may impact the project (external dependencies) 
and that need to be monitored and managed. The 
external activities  may be program-related and /o r 
organization-related. 

Activity Sequencing 

The  activity sequencing process  is expanded to 
include external dependencies and activity network 
templates. The network templates depict common, 
sequenced activities with dependencies. The 
repeatable process  is an organizational standard for 
all  projects.  Project teams document their network 
diagram approach, and  unusual aspects are 
documented. Network diagrams exist at the detailed 
level with discretionary, mandatory, and external

dependencies. The network templates are integrated 
into the standard scheduling software environment. 
Historical information is being collected such as the 
type of external dependencies. 

Schedule Development 
It is the norm to have a project schedule at 
appropriate levels of detail in line with the project 
scope and WBS. The  historical database is 
established and the organization is starting to collect 
and analyze actual project durations for similar 
activities. To calculate durations, project teams may 
rely upon expert knowledge, industry  standards, 
simulation techniques, and several organization- 
specific standards  and factors. The resource process 
to identify resource requirements is fully 
implemented within the organization. The 
scheduling process  is  fully integrated with the 
project  office, strategic planning systems, and risk 
management process.  The  project  office centrally 
manages resource prioritization. Baselines are 
established, adhered to, and managed. Project 
management software tools are standard for all 
projects and projects are integrated within program 
areas. Cost and schedule information is integrated. 
Metrics are collected and analyzed in areas such a s 
duration  standards, capability factors, and resource 
dedication factors. All processes are in place, 
documented, and being utilized. Cost and schedule 
information is integrated with technical information. 

Project T ime  Managemen t 

Schedule  Control 

The schedule change control system, schedule 
reporting process, and earned value analysis 
processes are followed  by  project teams. Schedule 
changes/status are being identified, evaluated, 
managed, and stakeholders are informed. A 
performance measurement process  is developed and 
documented to evaluate project schedule status  and 
take corrective action. Schedule baselines are 
established, adhered to, and managed. Cost and 
schedule reports are integrated. Performance  metrics 
(such as schedule variance and estimates a t 
completion) are monitored and analyzed, and 
corrective  actions  are implemented. All processes 
are in  place, documented, and being utilized. The 
schedule change control system is integrated with 
the organization’s control systems, monitoring 
programs, and risk management process.  Cost and 
schedule reports are integrated with technical 
reports. 

Schedule Integration 

A process is developed and documented to integrate 
program and organization-wide schedules. The 
process  is used for program schedules to depict and 
integrate program schedules at  summary  and 
detailed levels.  The program integration is centrally 
conducted, easily accomplished, and the process  is 
repeatable. A process, system, and approach is 
employed for integrating programs and schedules 
across the organization. The organization develops, 
distributes, and analyzes integrated program 
schedules and integrated master schedules for the

Projects are managed with consideration to how the project 
performed in the past and  what is  expected  for the future. 
Management uses efficiency and effectiveness metrics to 
make decisions regarding the project. All projects, changes, 
and issues are evaluated based upon metrics from the 
schedule baselines, planned status, actual status, and 
schedule performance efficiency.  The  metrics are used to 
understand the performance of a project during execution 
for making management decisions  for the future. 

Activity Definition 

Project  activities are regularly monitored, focusing 
on information that is dependent  upon other 
projects or programs throughout the organization. 
Management uses this information to make 
decisions regarding the project and related efforts. A 
process  focusing on this information for making 
management decisions  is developed, documented, 
and in place.  Lessons learned are being captured. 

Activity Sequencing 

Project dependencies are regularly monitored, 
focusing on dependencies between projects and

Baseline estimates (both revised and original) are 
not only used to manage individual projects, but are 
also used to make management decisions regarding 
project execution. Resource utilization is maximized 
and variance reports measure performance metrics 
of efficiency and effectiveness. Schedule status is 
used to support management decision-making. A 
process utilizing baseline, resource utilization 
measurements, and schedule status for management 
decisions is developed, documented, and in place. 
Lessons learned are being captured. The baseline 
process is fully integrated with the organization’s 
strategic planning systems and risk management 
process. 

Schedule  Control 

Schedule assessments are incorporated and included 
in the determination of project  efficiency and 
effectiveness. For certain projects, earned value and 
performance status reporting is integrated with cost 
and schedule systems. The schedule supports 
earned value analysis and the capability exists to 
calculate the budgeted cost of work scheduled and 
performed, and schedule estimate at completion. All 
earned value techniques are used, including 
performance indices,  to compare project 
performance to the project baseline and make 
forecasts, as  appropriate. Earned value techniques 
are used to update project schedules (revise the 
baseline costs) and to support the determination of 
project  efficiency and effectiveness. A process using 
schedule assessments and earned value techniques

CHAPTER 6 

Project  Cost Management 

T” OVERALL PURPOSE of cost management is  to determine 
the total costs of the project, manage to those costs, and 
ensure the project  completes within the approved  budget. 
Cost management involves identifying required resources, 
estimating the cost of those resources, developing a project 
baseline, comparing progress against the baseline, and 
controlling costs. 

Components 

Resource Planning 

Resource planning includes identifying what 
resources and quantities are needed for the project. 
Resources include labor  category, hours, material, 
and equipment. The outcome of this component is a 
listing of the project resource requirements. 

Cost Estimating 

Cost  estimating  is an analytical  process using factors, 
equations,  relationships, and expert knowledge to 
develop the cost of a product, service, or process. If 
detailed  resources are identified,  cost estimating 
applies rates and factors  to determine the cost.  The 

Project Managemen t  Ma tu r i ty Model 

94 

main outcome  is a project  cost  estimate and  a cost 
management plan. 

Cost Budgeting 

Cost budgeting involves developing a project  cost 
baseline by  allocating the cost estimate to individual 
elements in the work breakdown structure. Cost 
budgeting includes timephasing the cost estimate to 
develop the baseline. The main product of this 
component is a project  cost baseline. 

Performance  Measurement 

Earned value involves measuring the project 
performance to determine whether work has been 
accomplished in accordance with plans. Earned 
value uses the cost baseline and compares actual 
performance against the baseline plan. The main 
products are a comparison of actuals to the baseline 
and  earned value metrics. 

Cost Control 

Cost control involves managing the cost baseline to 
ensure the project  completes within the approved 
budget. Managing the cost baseline involves 
implementing a cost control system, publishing cost 
status reports, analyzing cost performance metrics, 
determining changes to the cost baseline, managing 
the authorized changes, informing stakeholders, and 
taking corrective action. The main products from 
this component include cost reports, cost 
performance analyses, revised project  cost baseline, 
and lessons learned. 

Project Cos t Managemen t 

Level 1 

Initial Process 

There is recognition of accepted  processes, but there are no 
established practices or standards. Individual teams or 
parts of the organization may have their own way of doing 
things in an  ad hoc, informal fashion. Documentation of the 
processes  is  loose and makes it difficult to repeat the 
activities elsewhere. Management is aware of the 
importance of cost management and  has periodically asked 
for  cost metrics. 

Resource Planning 

Project managers have developed their own way of 
identifying resources and quantities needed (labor 
category, hours, equipment, material). Functional 
support areas are sometimes overlooked. The way 
things are done is not documented and varies by 
project. 

Cost  Estimating 

Estimates are developed on an  ad hoc basis and may 
or may not capture all  costs.  Generally, the project 
manager will have a scope statement and a schedule 
that consists of a basic set of milestones, and 
occasionally deliverables, to determine what to 
estimate. The documentation for the estimates is 
incomplete, limited, and not required by the 
organization. Individual project teams may have 
access  to some tools and techniques, but they are not 
standardized  throughout the organization. 

Project Managemen t  Ma tu r i ty Model 

- 

96 Cost Budgeting 

Project teams and segments of the organization may 
have adopted ways of developing a cost baseline 
(allocating and timephasing the cost estimate). There 
is no established practice, and documentation of the 
processes is incomplete. 

Performance  Measurement 

Project performance analysis is calculated on an  ad 
hoc basis and  done informally.  Periodically simple 
performance metrics are developed (e.g., planned 
budget  and major milestones). There  is no 
established practice or procedure; individuals follow 
their own methods. The validity and consistency of 
the information is suspect since standards are not in 
place. 

Cost Control 

Individual project teams and segments of the 
organization are applying their own approach to 
managing and controlling costs.  Cost changes are 
unequally managed and, in many cases, not 
monitored. Ad  hoc  cost reports are provided on a 
by-request basis. When  cost performance is tracked, 
it is by the use of nonstandard practices. 

Project Cos t  Managemen t 

Level 2 

Structured  Process and Standards 

There are documented processes in place  for identifying 
generic  key resources (labor categories, hours, equipment, 
and material), generating and documenting project  cost 
estimates, publishing and distributing reports, and 
monitoring basic  cost  metrics. Although the processes are 
in place, they are not considered an organizational 
standard. Management supports the efforts and is involved 
on large, highly visible  projects. A basic cost-estimating 
template exists.  Metrics  exist  for  basic  cost information 
(planned  budget, percent complete) although they may be 
collected and correlated manually. Additional processes are 
likely  to  exist  for resource cost planning, historical cost 
database development, earned value techniques, cost 
reporting, and cost performance analysis. Summary and 
detailed information is developed and collected.  Project 
management processes are considered standard practice for 
large, visible  projects. All documented processes are 
repeatable. 

Resource Planning 

A complete resource listing is defined for  all labor 
categories, equipment, and material. Everyone is 
encouraged to utilize the listing as  a checklist  for 
identifying resources (it is standard practice  for 
large, highly visible  projects). A planning process is 
developed and documented to include the resource 
listing and methodologies for determining 
quantities. The organization has  industry  standard 
tools, techniques, and /o r factors for the project 
teams to approximate quantities. The planning 
process  is supported by management and is 

Project Manag em en t  Ma tu r i t y Model 

- 

98 

becoming accepted throughout the organization. 
The  generic resource listing is incorporated into the 
project  office’s resource repository and project- 
specific requirements are manually inserted into the 
repository. 

Cost  Estimating 

The organization has  a documented process  for 
generating and documenting project  cost estimates. 
Generally, a scope statement is prepared, a top-level 
WBS template (levels one and two showing the 
organization’s preferred primary project work 
breakdown  structure) exists, and  a  summary 
schedule is normally in place.  These items support 
the development of summary-level estimates for the 
upper levels of the WBS. A basic cost-estimating 
template is established (may include things such as 
description of item, WBS element, work hours 
estimate, number of resources, equipment, material, 
travel, risk  factors, source of estimate, and key 
assumptions). Average resource billing rates are 
developed for  generic resources. A cost-estimating 
historical database exists  to develop cost standards 
and factors. A cost management plan and process  is 
developed, documented, and is standard practice on 
large, visible  projects.  The organization has access  to 
tools, techniques, commercial databases, and 
industry cost standards  and factors, and 
organization-specific  cost standards  and factors are 
in the early formulation stages. Scope statements are 
prepared a s standard practice  on large, visible 
projects.  It  is the norm to have a project schedule a t 
least to  level three in the WBS. The  capability  exists 

- 

99 

Project Cost Managemen t 

to estimate most levels of the WBS (using the scope 
statement and WBS template) resulting in detailed 
project  cost estimates, a s appropriate. Project risks 
are considered. A system is in place  to record project 
estimates and collect actuals ("estimated" actuals 
from project teams versus accounting actuals from 
corporate systems) for future comparison. Average 
resource rates are developed for resources where 
standards can be established. 

Cost Budgeting 

Baselining  is not yet  common practice nor 
established as an organizational standard, except  for 
large, highly visible  projects.  The organization has  a 
documented process  for  allocating, timephasing, 
and baselining a project.  The  project has  a staff 
management plan that supports the development of 
the time-phased baseline. The capability exists to 
baseline projects, and most  projects are developing 
and documenting project baselines a t differing levels 
of detail. Baselines are established in line with the 
project schedule, but may change frequently. 

Performance  Measurement 

The organization is capable of t r a c h g summary- 
level hours  and  budget  and tracking progress 
toward achieving milestones.  The  basic process is 
documented. Basic metrics such a s planned  budget 
and milestone percent complete are utilized. The 
organization is capable of simple variance analysis 
of project hours  (using planned versus actuals). 
Metrics such as planned budget,  planned  hours, 
hours  spent,  and delta are established. A system is

- 

100 

in place  to  collect 
"estimated" project actuals 
(normally hours) from the project teams (versus 
extracting accounting information from corporate 
systems). 

Cost Control 

A process  is developed and documented to publish 
and distribute cost reports. Periodic  cost reports are 
developed at the summary level and provided to 
key stakeholders. Summary cost reports are 
produced from an integrated system. Basic  cost 
metrics (planned  budget  and percent complete) are 
collected and  reported. A process is developed and 
documented for managing and controlling cost and 
the concept of a cost  change control system is 
introduced. The  process includes items such as cost 
statusing, a change control form, a change log, and 
an issues log/form. Baselines are established in line 
with the project schedule, but may change 
frequently. Summary and detailed cost reports are 
developed and provided to  key stakeholders. 
"Estimated"  project actuals are provided by the 
project teams (versus extracting accounting actuals 
from corporate systems).

Organizational Standards and 
Institutionalized Process 

All processes are in  place and documented. The  processes 
are considered an organizational standard  and are being 
utilized by nearly all  projects.  The cost-estimating process is 
expanded to include analyses of alternatives. The 
performance measurement process  is expanded beyond 
simple variance analyses. The  cost change control system is 
in place and implemented. All processes are repeatable. 
Systems are becoming more integrated: resource 
requirements are uploaded into the project  office’s resource 
repository, project baselining is integrated with the project 
office’s automated scheduling system (or something 
comparable), and cost reporting is  easily accomplished. 
Metrics are collected and analyzed on the types of 
resources, cost estimates, and project performance and 
efficiency.  The  project teams reconcile ”estimated” actuals 
versus accounting actuals from corporate financial/ 
accounting systems. Management fully supports  the cost 
management processes and  has institutionalized the 
procedures and  standards. 

Resource Planning 

The planning process  is  fully implemented within 
the organization. Documentation exists on all 
planning processes and  standards for identifying 
resource requirements. The  project’s resource 
requirements are uploaded into the project  office’s 
resource repository. Metrics are collected and 
analyzed on the types of resources required by 

Project Manag em en t  Ma tu r i t y Model 

- 

102 

projects and the resource  availability  to 
determine 
organizational efficiency  in identifying and staffing 
resources. 

Cost  Estimating 

The  cost-estimating  process is further expanded to 
include cost analyses of alternatives. The entire 
process  is  fully documented and repeatable. The 
process outlined within the cost management plan is 
in place and implemented. Several organization- 
specific  cost standards  and factors are developed. 
Comparisons are made between actual project  costs 
(forecasts based upon actuals-to-date) and the 
original estimates. Metrics are collected, analyzed, 
and  reported. The  historical database is established, 
and data are collected and analyzed for future 
reference and quantitative application. 

Cost Budgeting 

Projects are developing and documenting project 
baselines at the lowest reasonable level.  The 
baselines are established in line with the project 
schedule. The capability  exists  to enter the time- 
phased estimates into the project software 
environment (or something comparable) at  any 
appropriate level of detail. The baseline process  is 
fully integrated with the project office’s project 
schedule system (or something comparable), 
documented, and repeatable. Baselines are 
established, adhered to, and managed.

Project Cost Managemen t 

The performance measurement process  is expanded 
beyond basic variance calculations  to include earned 
value analysis on appropriate projects.  The full 
process is documented and repeatable. The 
capability exists  to  calculate the budgeted cost of 
work scheduled and performed, the actual cost of 
work performed, budget  at completion, and estimate 
at completion. Metrics include basic performance 
measurement calculations with actuals provided by 
the project teams versus corporate financial/ 
accounting systems. 

Cost Control 

The  cost change control process, cost-reporting 
process, and performance measurement analysis 
processes are followed and utilized by the project 
teams (cost changes/status are being identified, 
evaluated, managed, and stakeholders are 
informed). Baselines are established, adhered to, and 
managed. Cost and schedule reports are integrated. 
Earned value and performance status reporting is 
integrated with cost and schedule systems. 
Performance metrics (such as schedule variance, cost 
variance, and estimates a t completion) are 
monitored, analyzed, and corrective actions are 
implemented. The project teams reconcile 
"estimated" actuals versus accounting actuals from 
corporate financial/accounting systems.

Managed Process 

Processes and  standards are integrated with other 
corporate processes and systems. Integration includes the 
resource planning process with the project  office and 
human resources management process.  In addition, the 
cost-estimating, cost-baselining, earned value, and cost 
control processes are integrated with the project  office, 
finance/accounting, strategic planning systems, and risk 
management process.  Actuals are provided by the 
corporate financial/accounting systems and analyzed by 
the project teams. There is a mandate to  comply with the 
organizational project management processes and 
procedures. Management takes an "organizational view" of 
projects. 

Resource Planning 

All  processes are in place, documented, and being 
utilized. The planning process  is  fully integrated 
with  the project  office  (for resource prioritization 
and scheduling) and the human resources project 
management process (for resource acquisition, 
assignment, and forecasts). 

Cost Estimating 

All  processes are in place, documented, and being 
utilized. The cost-estimating process  is fully 
integrated with the project  office, finance/ 
accounting, strategic planning systems, and risk 
management process.  Organization-specific  cost 
standards  and factors exist  for elements of the WBS 
that are consistently used and  standard in projects.

Performance  Measurement 

All earned-value techniques are used as  appropriate 
on key  projects where logical application provides 
measurable benefit, including performance indices, 
to compare project performance to the project 
baseline and make forecasts, as appropriate. Projects 
are employing such techniques, if applicable. The 
earned-value process is integrated with the 
organization’s finance/accounting, strategic 
planning systems, and risk management process. 
Earned value is used to update project  costs and 
revise the baseline costs, if applicable. Actuals are 
provided by the corporate financial/accounting 
systems and analyzed by the project teams. 

Cost Control 

All  processes are in place, documented, and being 
utilized. The  cost change control system is 
integrated with the organization’s control systems, 
monitoring programs, and risk management 
process.  Cost and schedule reports are integrated 
with technical status reports. Actuals are provided 
by the corporate financial/accounting systems and 
analyzed by the project teams. A performance 
measurement process  is developed and documented 
to evaluate project  cost status  and take corrective 
action. The  process  is documented and repeatable.

Optimizing Process 

Improvement procedures are in place and utilized. Lessons 
learned are regularly examined and used to improve 
documented processes.  Projects are managed with 
consideration as to how the project performed in the past 
and  what is  expected  for the future. Management uses 
efficiency and effectiveness  metrics  to  make  decisions 
regarding the project. All  projects,  changes, and issues are 
evaluated based upon metrics from cost estimates, baseline 
estimates, and earned value. The  metrics are used to 
understand the performance of a project during execution 
for making management decisions  for the future. 

Resource Planning 

An improvement process  is in place  to continuously 
improve resource planning to  completely identify all 
requirements as early as possible in the right 
quantities. Lessons learned are captured and used to 
improve resource-planning efforts.  The planning 
process includes a method to identify an 
organizational priority for obtaining additional 
resources during project  execution.  The priority 
designator is linked to the management decisions 
and gives project teams the ability  to identify the 
priority of their resource requests. The enhanced 
process is developed, documented, and in  place. 
Lessons learned are being captured.

CHAPTER 7 

Project Quality 
Management 

T” OVERALL PURPOSE of quality management is to satisfy 
the customer, to  conform to requirements, to ensure 
fitness for purpose, and to ensure the product is  fit  for use. 
I t is that set of activities/tasks that are required to ensure 
the project  satisfies  all the needs for which it was 
undertaken  (and which are documented in the statement of 
work), and includes a focus on quality management from 
the perspective of product, processes, and  the people 
needed to make quality an effective and efficient aspect of 
successful project completion. 

Components 

Quality Planning 

Quality planning involves  identifymg quality 
standards, practices, and associated quality activities. 
Planning  for quality should be done in parallel with 
other project planning processes.  The  main product 
from quality planning is the quality management 
plan, which  identifies the specific quality practices, 
resources, and activities  relevant  to the project and its 
deliverables. It includes strategies for implementing 
quality assurance and control. 

Project Managemen t Ma t i i r i ty Model 

- 

110 Quality Assurance 

Quality assurance involves developing and 
assessing processes, procedures, and standards to 
assure the project will meet relevant quality 
standards. 

Quality Control 

Quality control involves monitoring actual project 
results to see if they comply with relevant quality 
standards and identifying ways to eliminate causes 
of unsatisfactory results. Quality control activities 
are the procedures necessary to ensure the project 
deliverables meet the quality objectives and 
attributes defined in the team’s quality management 
plan. 

Special Interest Component-Management Oversight 

The overall purpose of management oversight is to 
understand, support, and be involved in project 
management activities. This includes the following 
two items: 

Awareness and Support 

Awareness and support involves management 
understanding and being cognizant of project 
management activities and advocating organization- 
wide implementation of project management 
processes and standards. 

Involvement 

Involvement covers management participation and 
inclusion in project management activities, 
processes, and standards. 

Pro jec t Q u a l i t y M a n a g e m e n t 

Level 1 

Initial Process 

Management has an awareness of the need for quality 
management, but there are no established practices or 
standards. Management is considering how they should 
define ”quality.” 

Quality Planning 
Some project teams may develop high-level quality 
plans, but on an ad hoc basis, with each project 
manager doing a s s /h e sees fit. 

Quality Assurance 
There are no established practices or standards for 
quality assurance, but some project teams establish 
project procedures for their project teams and on an 
ad hoc basis check to make sure everyone is following 
the procedures. 

Quality Control 
There are no established practices or standards for 
quality control, but many project team members will 
have someone ”look over” their work product before 
they submit it to management. On an ad hoc basis 
there may be testing applied to specific units or 
portions of the product for development-based 
projects (e.g., in an IT environment each analyst/ 
programmer does his/her own testing to see if his/ 
her part of the product works). 

Management Oversight 
Management recognizes that there are project 
management processes occurring within the 

Project Manag em en t  Ma tu r i t y Model 

- 

112 

organization  on an  ad hoc  basis  by 
individual project 
managers.  Management understands the definition of 
a project and is aware of the need for  project 
management. 

Awareness and Support 

Management is aware of project management 
processes and recognizes that there is a difference 
between the requirements for  project management 
and operational management. Management 
supports  individual interest in applying project 
management standards or processes on  an  ad hoc 
basis at the discretion of the project manager, but 
does not require any conformity of use. 

Involvement 

Management’s involvement in daily project 
activities is limited to inquiring about project status, 
should the need arise  for such information. 

Project Qua l i ty  Managemen t 

Level 2 

Structured  Process and Standards 

A basic organizational quality policy has been adopted  and 
management encourages the use of it on large and highly 
visible  projects. Management is supportive of the time 
required to add quality to a project, such as defining and 
implementing quality control metrics into a project. The 
organization’s quality policy has been bolstered to state the 
organization’s quality objectives, the level of quality 
acceptable  to the organization, and the roles/ 
responsibilities of members of the organization for 
executing the policy and ensuring quality. Management 
takes an active  role  in ensuring that quality standards are 
accounted for and applied to  most  projects. 

Quality Planning 

The quality planning process has been enhanced to 
include such quality assurance processes a s 
flowcharting and operational definitions (metrics) 
and quality control measures. Metrics include 
results of reviews and tests against criteria, 
specifications, quality standards,  and business 
requirements. Most people in the organization 
consider the quality planning process as the 
standard way of ensuring quality is accounted for 
within the project products/services. Most of the 
projects-and  all 
the large, highly visible  projects- 
are actually using these quality planning processes, 
including the development of a quality management 
plan. Management signs off on the quality plans on 
these larger projects. 

Project M a n a g e n m t  M a t u r i t y Model 

- 

114 Quality Assurance 

There is a basic approach for quality assurance. For 
large, highly visible  projects, teams establish project 
procedures and use walkthroughs or peer reviews to 
assure the team is  following procedures. The team 
may identify the points in the development process 
at which there may be a need for extra quality 
precautions. Quality assurance processes, including 
tools and techniques such a s flowcharting and 
operational definitions, are considered standard 
approaches on large, highly visible  projects.  The 
project  office provides a quality policy and project 
management processes and  standards to support the 
quality assurance measures on projects.  Project 
teams also have devised checklists  for use in 
checking/promoting quality throughout the project 
life  cycle. Other project teams use tools and 
techniques, such as design of experiment concepts 
throughout the project. 

Quality Control 

The basic quality process includes suggested 
approaches for quality control,  in that it provides 
guidelines for testing specific units or portions of the 
product, first-level integration test  (for development 
projects), and a review of individual project 
deliverables/products by the project team (e.g., in 
an IT environment guidelines are laid out for the 
testing of modules and programs, to ascertain that 
each part of the system works, and also for testing 
the system resulting when these modules and 
programs are integrated together). Summary-level 
testing metrics are collected and evaluated. The  tools 
utilized include acceptance criteria, performance 

- 

115 

Project Q u a l i t y Managerner t t 

standards, business requirements, specifications, 
and quality standards for the reviews/testing. The 
quality control processes are used on large and 
highly visible  projects and encouraged on all other 
projects.  Full  acceptance  criteria and specifications 
are developed, including business requirements and 
quality standards. The quality process includes 
templates and guidelines for: 
. Unit testing (testing of the individual 
Deliverable and  product testing (including 
evaluation by the customer) 
components of the product) 
Integration testing (testing how the major 
assemblies of the product work together). 
The  project team does unit and integration testing. 
Both summary-level and detailed testing metrics are 
collected and eyaluated. 

Management Oversight 

Basic  project management processes  exist in the 
organization, but they are not considered an 
organizational standard-only 
large or highly 
visible  projects are required to use them. Basic 
summary-level metrics have been established for 
projects  to  track  project  cost, schedule, and technical 
performance (triple constraint). Most  project 
management processes are in place and are 
considered standard practice  for larger, more visible 
projects. Management understands the value of 
project management and endorses its use 
throughout the organization. Although management 
is not consistently involved in the project 
management processes throughout the organization, 

Project Manag em en t  Ma tu r i t y Model 

- 

116 

they do take an active role and are consistently 
involved in the larger, more visible  projects. 

Awareness and Support 

Management oversight on large or highly visible 
projects encourages the establishment of project  cost, 
schedule, and technical performance planning and 
tracking and will provide the project managers with 
the tools  or training required to develop such project 
planning elements. Management receives status 
reports and formal acceptance  notification of project 
completion. Management supports the use of the 
standardized project management processes  across 
the organization for  all  projects and will provide the 
training or tools required by  project managers to 
implement these  processes.  Large or highly visible 
projects are required to implement these processes, 
as management recognizes that such processes are a 
contributing factor to project  success. 

Involvement 

On large or highly visible  projects, management 
encourages summary progress reporting of project 
performance at the milestone  level  for schedule and 
cost. If there are issues or changes that require 
management approval, management provides such 
on a requested basis. Management approves the 
project charter and assigns project managers. On 
large or highly visible  projects, management plays 
an active  role  in requiring regular project status 
reports that show baselined project plans and the 
collection of actual performance metrics. On these 
projects, management expects  to be apprised of 
project performance (and provides appropriate 
response), to be in the approval chain for change 

- 

117 

Project Qua l i ty  Managemen t 

control items that impact the triple constraints, and 
to be in the issues management process  for 
escalation and resolution of issues that cannot be 
resolved within the confines of the project team. If 
requested, management will  take a more prominent 
role in small and medium-sized projects, but 
otherwise only requires performance reporting from 
project managers when called upon. Management 
signs off on project completion. 

Project Managemen t M a t u r i t y Model

118 

Level 3 

Organizational Standards and 
Institutionalized Process 

The quality process is now well documented and is an 
organizational standard; most of the projects follow this 
standard. Management signs off on the quality plan and 
final testing for all projects and often participates in quality 
reviews. Quality has a program focus-that 
is, how well 
does the product perform within the context of all other 
products/systems in the immediate domain of the product? 
Management supports the development of a quality 
department and has identified one or two people whose 
focus is organizational project quality standards and 
assurance. 

Quality Planning 

The quality planning process has been enhanced to 
include guidelines for design of experiments 
(analytical techniques that help identify which 
variables have the most influence on the overall 
outcome), emphasis on quality milestones, and has 
standardized checklists for the use of the project 
teams in creating their quality plans. The process 
prescribes a formal quality plan and has templates for 
the creation of such; it includes organizational 
management at key approval points. The quality 
planning process now includes the scope /perspective 
of other entities in the immediate domain of the 
products of the project (e.g., in an IT environment, 
when a new system is the product, the systems with 
which this system interfaces are included in the 

Project Qua l i ty Management 

quality plan). The organization has identified one or 
two people whose focus is organizational project 
quality standards and assurance. 

- 

119 

Quality Assurance 

Tools and techniques, such as design of experiments 
and quality assurance checklists, are now 
considered standard approaches on large, highly 
visible projects and are suggested approaches on all 
projects. Projects take on a proactive stance in 
quality and plans for regular walkthroughs with 
organizational management and other project teams 
as major portions of the product are developed to 
assure that the product will function correctly with 
other elements of the environment. 

Quality Control 

Project performance standards are identified and 
begin to be established and measured against. The 
quality process includes templates and guidelines 
for: 
Model office that emulates a production 
environment and allows for product testing in a 
simulated situation 
Interface testing (testing how the product works 
in its environment with other systems/products) 
Acceptance testing (testing the human interface 
and testing against the original requirements). 

The client is actively involved in interface testing, 
although the actual testing is performed by the 
project team. The client d r ive s acceptance testing-in 

Pro jec t  Managemen t  Ma tur i ty Model 

- 

120 

fact,  acceptance testing requires a signoff from both 
the client and management before being accepted as 
completed. 

Management Oversight 

All  project management processes are in place, are 
repeatable, and most  projects are expected to use 
them. These  processes involve the clients as active 
and integral members of the project  team. 
Management fully supports  and has 
institutionalized the processes and  standards. 
Management is regularly involved in input  and 
approval of key  decisions and documents and in  key 
project  issues. 

Awareness and Support 

Management is required to attend project 
management awareness training that is geared 
toward their role in project management and 
establishing expectations for  project outcomes. 
Management supports the projects within the 
organization by ensuring they have visibility and 
prioritization. In addition, management recognizes 
and  supports the discipline of project management 
as  a profession unto itself, including the distinct 
roles within the field beyond project manager, such 
as project support-type roles and project leadership- 
type roles. 

Invo lvemen t 

Informal variance analysis, to compare project 
baseline and project actuals, is  expected  by 
management on most  projects.  This information is 

Project Qua l i ty  Managemen t 

- 

121 

then used by management in evaluating the relative 
progress of the project compared to other projects. 
Management is  actively involved in key  critical 
decisions within the projects, including change 
control, issue escalation,  risk response, quality 
assurance, and customer interaction. Management 
co-assigns  project managers. 

Project Managemen t  Ma tu r i ty Model

122 

Level 4 

Managed Process 

Organizational management has mandated that all  projects 
follow the quality planning standard processes. Nearly all 
of the projects employ them. Quality is viewed from an 
organizational perspective-the quality of the product is 
evaluated in light of all other products/systems in the 
environment and how well  it  will  meet the business 
objectives.  There  is an established quality office within the 
organization responsible for quality standards  and 
assurance to quality processes  for  all  projects. 

Quality Planning 

The quality planning process now includes the 
perspective of the entire environment into which the 
product of the project  is being placed. A quality 
office is established within the organization. The 
organization benchmarks its project results against 
industry  standard results. 

Quality Assurance 

Projects regularly include walkthroughs with 
organizational management and other project teams 
as major portions of the product are developed to 
assure that the product will  meet the business 
requirements and specifications. Documentation 
procedures are in place that require each  major 
component (subsystem, database, interface, etc.) of 
the product to be fully documented prior to moving 
into a final production mode. Nearly  all of the 
projects use quality assurance processes/methods as 
specified  by the quality standards. Metrics  collected 

Project Qua l i ty  Managemen t 

throughout the project  life  cycle are regularly 
compared to industry  standards to ascertain 
potential problem areas. 

Quality  Control 

The organization has performance standards in 
place;  project products are consistently tested 
against these standards. The organization has 
functional standards in place;  project products are 
consistently tested against these standards. The 
quality process includes templates and guidelines 
for testing that the products integrate with other 
products/systems in the organization, and  that all 
portions of the organization affected in any way by 
the product have an opportunity to adequately test 
those effects. 

Management Oversight 

Project management processes are integrated with 
corporate processes. Management clearly 
understands its role in the project management 
process and executes  it  well, managing a t the right 
level, and clearly differentiating management styles 
and project management requirements for different 
sizes/complexities of projects. An organizational 
mandate is  in  place  to  comply with the project 
management processes. 

Awareness and  Support 

Management actively endorses the project 
management processes as key  to organizational 
success  by ensuring project outcomes are successful. 
For example, the project  office has become 
integrated into the organizational framework as a 
full functioning area or division, management 

Project M a n a g em e n t  M a tw i t y Model 

- 

124 

perceives value of projectizing the organization and 
the utilization of matrixed  resources, and there is 
resource pool management and efficiency and 
effectiveness performance measurements. 
Management also encourages the evolution of the 
project management profession within the 
organization and actively supports the need for both 
project management expertise and technical 
expertise on all  projects. 

Involvement 

Formal variance analysis, to compare project 
baseline and project  actuals, is expected by 
management on all  projects. Management takes an 
active  role in performance measurement metrics of 
efficiency and effectiveness on corporate systems 
and project management processes. Management 
regularly serves in project-related  roles, such as 
project sponsor, executive change control board, 
customer liaison, and project mentoring. 

Project Qua l i ty  Managemen t 

Level 5 

Optimizing Process 

The quality process includes techniques/methods/ 
guidelines for feeding improvements back into the process. 
The quality process  focuses on the use of metrics in making 
benefit/cost comparisons, effectiveness and efficiency 
decisions, and final decision  on the quality of the product. 

Quality  Planning 

The quality planning process includes a process 
whereby the process  itself  is critiqued throughout 
the project.  Lessons learned are actively utilized to 
improve the process  for future projects.  The quality 
planning process integrates the usage of metrics and 
data from earlier projects, and from earlier stages of 
the given project,  to make benefit/cost comparisons 
and decisions regarding quality planning. The 
quality planning process uses the metrics and  data 
collected  to  make value-related trade-off  decisions 
regarding quality planning. 

Quality Assurance 

Feedback  is gained from the quality assurance 
processes and is  actively used to improve project 
management processes  for future projects. 
Effectiveness and efficiency  of both  the  product  and 
the project  processes are regularly measured using 
metrics collected throughout the project. 

Quality  Control 

Quality control/testing results are examined on a 
regular basis throughout the project  to ascertain 

Project Manag em en t  Ma tu r i t y Model 

- 

126 

improvements, which are integrated back into the 
process. Management uses quality control results to 
make  decisions  on the usability and fit of the 
product  and  when/if the product is  acceptable. 

Management Oversight 

Improvement procedures are in place and utilized. 
Lessons learned are regularly examined and used to 
improve documented processes.  Projects are given 
high value within the organization; thus there is 
high visibility  to the individuals who are actively 
involved in projects  on a regular basis.  All  projects, 
changes, and issues are evaluated based upon 
efficiency and effectiveness  metrics, and 
management takes an active role in management 
oversight and executive sponsorship of projects 
within the organization. Projects are directly tied  to 
the success of the organization; thus there is a 
financial tie  to  success of the organization and the 
project-related positions that are responsible for 
successful  project performance. 

Awareness and Support 

An improvement process is in place to continuously 
improve management’s awareness and  support of 
corporate projects and their needs. Lessons learned 
are  captured  and used to improve the monitoring 
and control efforts.  Projects are managed with 
consideration a s to how the project performed in the 
past and what is  expected  for the future. 
Management is aware of the need to capture lessons 
learned and the value of making decisions based 
upon efficiency and effectiveness  metrics.

T” OVERALL PURPOSE of human resource management is  to 
identify the requisite skill sets required for  specific 
project  activities,  to identify individuals who have those 
skill sets, and to  assign  roles and responsibilities for the 
project, managing and  ensuring high productivity of those 
resources, and forecasting future resource needs. 

Components 

Organizational Planning 

This  refers  to the activities of identifying, 
documenting, and assigning project  roles, 
responsibilities, and reporting relationships for the 
project. 

Staff Acquisition 

This covers identifying, soliciting, and acquiring the 
necessary resources for the project. 

Team Development and Buy-In 

Team development is the act of creating synergy 
between project team members to enhance

productivity, efficiency, and overall project success. 
Are there guidelines and  standards in place  to 
promote team buy-in to the project?  They should 
feel a part of the process of requirements analysis, 
scope development, etc. 

Special Interest Component-Professional 
Development 

The overall purpose of professional  project 
management development is  to develop the level of 
professionalism that exists within the organization’s 
project manager and project team member resource 
pool, as well as to develop how the organization 
supports  and views the professional requirements 
for  project management. This  is viewed by the 
following subcomponents: 

Individual Project Management Knowledge 

Individual knowledge base refers  to the knowledge 
acquired by the individual in project  management- 
a degree, a certificate, an awareness of the need for 
project management education. 

Individual Project Management Experience/ 
Competence 

This refers  to the individual’s actual experience in 
working on or leading projects.  Examples of project 
experience include working as a project controller, 
planner/scheduler, estimator, project management 
process expert, methodologist, project 
administrative support (change control, action  item, 
contract compliance, reporting, etc.) or mentor. 
Competency is measured by determining the 
effectiveness of an individual’s work efforts, or an 

Project Human Resource Managemen t 

individual’s ability  to  successfully lead the delivery 
of projects of varying size and complexity.

Corporate Initiative for  Project Management 
Development 

If the corporation acknowledges project 
management as  a cornerstone for building corporate 
success, then they will incorporate environmental 
success  factors, such as formalized professional 
developmental programs or  project management 
career path (including training, compensation, 
motivation, etc.) for  their  project managers and 
project  team members. 

Project Managemen t  Ma t l l r i ty Model 

Level 1 
Initial Process 

There  is  recognition within the organization of the need  for a 
human resource  project  management  process  consisting  of 
identifying resource requirements and "reserving"  them; 
however, there are no established  practices  or standards. 
This ad hoc  process  is  used  to determine how many people 
would be required to  accomplish  project  activities and define 
who is  available. In general, the "warm-body"  concept 
applies, which means that there is  an assumption that any 
person  can serve in  whatever  capacity  necessary. 
Documentation  is  loose and may  exist  in the form of a list of 
people working on a project. As such,  informal  project  teams 
may  exist in an ad hoc  sense.  Metric data exist  only  from the 
standpoint of who worked  on the last project, but are not 
required. 

Organizational  Planning 

There is  an  ad hoc  process of determining how 
many people are required to work on project 
activities. An informal reporting relationship exists, 
such that project  staff members know that they need 
to get their project assignments from the project 
manager. 

Staff  Acquisition 

There is an ad hoc  process of finding who is 
available to work on project  activities and going to 
line management to  ask  to have certain resources for 
a project. 

Team  Development 

Project Humat1 Resolrrce Managemen t 

- 

133 

There is an ad hoc  process of trying to ensure  that 
project team members work together in a 
professional manner, which may include 
occasionally trying to  get complementary 
personalities on the same project team. Occasional 
team meetings may be held whereby the team may 
be included in an explanation of the direction of the 
organization to the level that deliverables, scope, 
WBS, and the like have been defined. 

Professional Development 

There are pockets within the organization that have 
recognized that the skills and abilities required to 
successfully  lead a project are different than for other 
job functions, and thus could be considered a 
separate job function.  However, there are no 
corporate standards or  processes  in  place  from  which 
one can build the  justification  for a professional 
project  management  career path. Individual 
managers  may  recognize and give credit to  specific 
individuals for  their  project-related  accomplishments, 
but this  is done on an ad hoc and individual basis. 

Individual Project Management  Knowledge 

Some individuals within the organization may be 
recognized  or acknowledged for knowing more than 
others about some project management aspects, such 
as an ability to use a scheduling tool, an awareness 
of a budgeting mechanism, or an ability  to develop a 
general project scope statement.

Development 

Some managers within the organization may have 
acknowledged or  recognized the accomplishments 
of an individual  who  has worked on or has led a 
project with a successful outcome. 

Project Human Resource  Management 

Level 2

135 

Structured  Process and Standards 

There is a documented, repeatable process in place that 
defines how to  define,  acquire, and manage the human 
resources in the form of suggested inputs, tools and 
techniques, and outcomes. Formal teams are established on 
large projects that are held accountable  to  follow the  human 
resource management process. Management expects the 
project manager to have a project management human 
resource plan in place  for large projects.  Project team 
evaluations are conducted and project managers are 
expected to provide line management with a performance 
report for the individuals at the end of the project. 
Processes are readily available and integrated with other 
project planning elements. 

Organizational  Planning 

The  project manager creates a basic overview of the 
types of skill sets that are required by the project and 
the approximate timeframe in which these skill sets 
are needed. Basic responsibility definition exists in 
the form of a responsibility assignment matrix by 
major deliverable. A project organization chart exists 
so that the individuals on the project know who 
reports to whom on the project.  An informal 
analysis (which consists of the project team 
discussing these elements and defining their 
response, but no formal evaluation document 
produced for management) is conducted to define 
the organizational, technical, and interpersonal 
interfaces that exist within the organization. There is 
an  understanding of the constraints that may be 

Project Managemen t  Ma tu r i ty  Mode l 

- 

136 

prevalent in attaining required resources, such as 
the type of organization (hierarchical to projectized), 
and  individual preferences to work on one project or 
another. In addition to a project organization chart, 
there is a narrative description of the responsibilities 
for the key  project personnel and  a staffing plan that 
defines when resources will be needed. As the 
project progresses, measurement of planning versus 
actual will  occur with regard to the staffing plan. 
Updated planning information will  come from 
project integration and the staffing plan will provide 
corrective action, as necessary. 

Staff  Acquisition 

Staff acquisition consists of identifying the 
individuals  who have the requisite skill sets and 
time availability to work on the project.  The  project 
manager requests line management to reserve team 
members for a certain timeframe. A staffing 
requirements document will be submitted from cost 
management as an input for defining the staffing 
management plan. There  is a ”first come, first serve” 
process in place whereby whoever requests a 
resource first gets usage of that resource first. In 
addition, when  a resource is assigned by line 
management to a project,  line management 
documents that resource’s labor category, so that the 
project manager can utilize that information for 
costing purposes. If there is another project or 
assignment of extremely high priority, a resource 
may be withdrawn from a project by organizational 
management for a short period of time. The staffing 
plan includes defining the parameters for the 
desired project  team, including minimal experience, 

Project Human Resource Management 

personal interests and characteristics, and 
availability to determine a good  fit among project 
team members. However, the project manager must 
accept whatever resources are assigned by the line 
manager to the project.  Project human resource 
management and the project  office coordinate efforts 
in resource pool management. 

Team  Development 

Project teams may or may not have had  an 
opportunity to work together before; as such, the 
projects are begun with  an informal kickoff in which 
the team members are briefed on the purpose of the 
project, their responsibility, and introductions to 
each other. There  is a specified  process  for 
incorporating the team into scope development and 
the development of work plans, etc.  In addition, 
there are guidelines in place  for  project initiation 
team meetings, scheduled status reviews, business 
reviews, technical  reviews, and  a plan for regular 
and ongoing project reviews. These reviews should 
include the team, and will  foster team buy-in. 
Regular status  and progress meetings are conducted 
to keep project team members apprised of how the 
project is progressing, as well as to deal with issues 
that may arise. The  project manager contributes to 
the performance evaluation of the individual team 
members. A rewards  and recognition system is 
established whereby individual  and team 
performance is acknowledged. A conflict 
management process  is begun. Management 
enforces the process  for team buy-in to ensure that 
teams are actively involved and integrated into 
scope planning and management of the project. A

staff development plan is developed with the 
organization responsible for the professional 
development initiatives. 

Professional Development 

There is a general recognition within the 
organization that an individual’s knowledge base, 
experience, and competence are contributing factors 
to the successful outcome of projects. As such, for 
large and highly visible  projects there is an 
expectation that the project manager will have a 
fundamental knowledge set about project 
management and that the individual project team 
will be made aware of what is expected of them with 
regard to  project management planning 
components. The organization now has a track 
record that documents the value of an individual’s 
knowledge base,  experience, and competence as 
significant contributing factors to the successful 
outcome of projects. As such, the organization 
expects that most individuals working on projects 
will understand  how to apply the fundamentals 
(triple constraint) of the corporate project 
management process. In addition, the organization 
has  begun to define different project-related roles. 

Individual Project Management Knowledge 

I t is  expected that project managers on large or 
highly visible  projects  will  follow a defined process 
for attaining the triple constraint (scope-schedule- 
cost) and will be able to document and track these 
elements. It  is  also  expected that individual project 
team members will understand what is  expected  of 
them in fulfilling these elements (such a s 

- 

139 

Project H um a n Resource Managen len t 

contribution to scope validation, identification of 
schedule activities, and estimation of associated 
hours  for completing schedule activities). Most 
individuals working on  projects are expected to 
understand how to  define the triple constraint 
elements of scope, schedule, and cost, and what is 
required for tracking them. For large and highly 
visible  projects  it  is  expected that the project 
managers will be able  to develop a complete project 
plan  and manage to that plan. Some individual 
project team members are beginning to  recognize 
project-related areas of specialization, such as 
scheduling concepts, budgeting concepts,  project 
management methodologies, etc. 

Individual Project  Management Experience/ 
Competence 

I t is expected that project managers on large or 
highly visible  projects have managed other projects 
in the past successfully through  proper control of 
project outcomes, attaining a managed triple 
constraint and positive customer evaluations. It  is 
expected that individual project team members have 
also had successful  experience working on other 
projects and have demonstrated strong  individual 
and teaming attributes, as well a s timely delivery of 
high-quality deliverables. Most  project managers 
within the organization have been  project managers 
on previous projects and generally have a track 
record for  successfully completing projects within 
the triple constraint parameters. Some individual 
project  team members are beginning to demonstrate 
project-related  specialties where they have strengths, 
such as planner/scheduler, estimator, or 
methodologist.

Corporate Initiative for  Project  Management 
Development 

The organization acknowledges that i t is  necessary 
to have a defined project management process and 
has  made an educational course available to  project 
managers and project team members on large or 
highly visible  projects  to educate them on how to 
utilize this defined process. In addition, there is a 
recognition  process in place whereby those who are 
successful on large or highly visible  projects  will be 
acknowledged and compensated for their 
performance. The corporation makes available to 
anyone who will be involved on a project a project 
management essentials course, and all are 
encouraged to take this course to ensure  a basic 
understanding of project management concepts and 
applicability. The organization is  also beginning to 
define specific  project-related  roles that would be 
assigned to  specific  project team members. As such, 
the corporation recognizes that these separate roles 
will require different training, compensation, and 
motivation.

Organizational  Standards and 
Institutionalized  Process 

All  projects are expected  to  follow the human resource 
planning process,  which has been institutionalized. 
External stakeholders and customers are considered an 
integral part of the project team. 

Organizational  Planning 

A formal analysis is conducted to  define the 
organizational, technical, and interpersonal 
interfaces that exist within the organization. 
Constraints that may be prevalent in attaining 
required resources-such as the type of 
organization, individual preferences to work on one 
project or another-are analyzed and  a response is 
developed. There  is a narrative description of the 
responsibilities for  all of the project personnel. 

Staff  Acquisition 

The  project manager works with the project  office 
and line manager in resource pool management and 
prioritization. The  project manager may need to 
negotiate with line management for  specific 
resources, or will have "preassigned" resources. On 
occasion the project manager may need to  look 
outside the organization for  specific expertise. 

Team Development 

The  project manager works with the project  office 
and line management to establish collocation, as 
necessary. Project team peer evaluations may be 

Project Managemen t  Ma tu r i ty  Mode l 

- 

142 

conducted by the team for individual peer 
performance. A conflict management process has 
been developed and is being utilized on most 
projects. Management is integrally involved in the 
team buy-in process and a fully integrated project 
team includes the business unit, technical groups, 
strategic groups as necessary, the client,  etc.  All 
stakeholder input is  fully  solicited and is 
consciously incorporated into project planning and 
execution. 

Professional Development 

The organization has a defined project management 
process in place, and all  project managers are 
expected to  follow the process in planning and 
managing their  projects.  The organization has 
established different project-related  roles and 
expects that the individuals who are pursuing a 
project-related  career progression will  complete a 
gap analysis defining their current project 
management knowledge and experience and their 
desired state, thus determining what their needs are. 

Individual Project Management Knowledge 

All  project managers are expected  to have a solid 
knowledge base about how to plan and track 
projects, including following the defined project 
management methodology of the organization, 
which addresses all knowledge areas. In addition, 
project managers are encouraged to pursue a 
relationship with a professional project management 
association and work toward a certificate or degree 
related to  project management. Project team 
members who  are interested in the profession of 

- 

143 

Project H um a n Resource Managelrlent 

project management are encouraged to define an 
area of project  specialty  (or overall project 
management) and work toward attaining the 
knowledge required to  fulfill that role. 

Individual Project Management Experience/ 
Competence 

Project managers are evaluated on their project 
performance, which includes their ability to  meet the 
triple constraint parameters, customer satisfaction, 
and project team member  satisfaction,  to define a 
competency range that can be utilized for defining 
effectiveness.  Project team members are actively 
pursuing the organizationally defined project  roles 
and effectiveness measurements that are established 
to define competency  in  each of these roles. Client 
satisfaction surveys are periodically conducted to 
ascertain the abilities and impact of the project 
manager. This information is utilized to help 
determine competency and contributes to 
performance-related compensation. 

Corporate Initiative for  Project Management 
Development 

The corporation insists that all project stakeholders 
(within the organization) attend a project 
management essentials course that covers the basic 
elements of project management and the specific 
roles and responsibilities of various project 
stakeholders (such as executive management or 
project sponsor). In addition, there are a series of 
project management courses geared toward the 
career progression of a project manager and there is 
a t least one course for  each of the recognized project 
team specialty areas. The organization recognizes 

Project Managemen t  Ma tu r i ty  Mode l 

- 

144 

that effective  project management is a cornerstone to 
organizational success and that to create an 
environment for  success the organization is 
responsible for defining project-related professional 
tracks. As such, the organization has defined 
different roles (and associated compensation, 
training, and motivation) within a project that are 
considered project  team  roles at or below the status 
of project manager: project manager, project 
controller, planner /scheduler, estimator, and project 
administrative support. Those who are interested in 
pursuing  a career in a project-related discipline 
should have a gap analysis and game plan to gain 
the knowledge and skills required. 

Project Human Resource  Management 

Level 4 

Managed Process 

All projects are expected  to  follow the human resource 
planning process, which has been mandated. Management 
expects the project managers, project  office, and line 
managers to work cohesively  in resource pool management 
and prioritization. Decisions relating to each  project are 
evaluated in light of other projects.  Project team evaluations 
and performance reporting for the individuals at the end of 
the project play a significant  role in individual performance 
reviews and measurements. Project teams work in 
conjunction with other corporate processes and systems. 

Organizational  Planning 

Project organizational planning is integrated into the 
overall resource  pool management and 
prioritization. An  action plan is developed to deal 
with the organizational, technical, and interpersonal 
interfaces that exist within the organization. 
Constraints to resource planning are  managed. 
There is commitment by all stakeholders to the 
definition of the roles and responsibilities in  the 
staffing plan. Integrated decision-making (which 
means that decisions are evaluated based on their 
impact to both the project and the organization) 
begins to  occur. 

Staff Acquisition 

The  project  office has an effective resource pool 
management (including skills inventory database) 
and prioritization process in place that is used by the 
line and project managers in fulfilling  project 

Project Manag em en t  Ma tu r i t y Model 

- 

146 

resource needs. Resource variance reports are 
developed for  all  projects. 

Team  Development 

The organization adheres to a team development 
process  to  foster team concepts throughout the 
organization. A team development process  is 
established by  which teams on medium and large 
projects are expected  to  evolve.  Team member 
training needs are identified and communicated to 
the project  office and line management, who 
proactively works with the team member to  meet 
those training needs. The  project manager 
significantly contributes to the performance 
evaluation of the individual. The  conflict 
management process  is being utilized on all  projects. 
The team buy-in process  is engaged and used by the 
majority of projects. Management is  actively 
engaged in the team-there  is probably a project 
board in place that represents all stakeholders in the 
project.  This  project board is  actively involved in the 
project on a regular basis (status, execution, 
planning, etc.). 

Professional Development 

Management supports the integration of the 
professional project-related  tracks into the corporate 
human resource structure of the organization. 
Individuals are specifically hired based upon their 
project management knowledge and competence in 
the planning and execution of projects.

Project managers on large or highly visible  projects 
are expected  to have a degree or  PMP-type 
certificate.  Project managers on small- or medium- 
size projects are encouraged to pursue  a certificate, 
degree, or foundation set that demonstrates a solid 
knowledge base in project management. Project 
team members who have chosen  to  focus in a 
project-related specialty area are actively pursuing  a 
related certificate or degree in that area. 

' 

Individual Project Management Experience/ 
Competence 

A project-related  role  competency measurement has 
been defined and individuals are given a continuum 
that can be utilized for performance measurement 
and career growth. Client  satisfaction surveys are 
periodically conducted to ascertain the abilities and 
impact of both the project manager and the project 
team members. This information is utilized to help 
determine competency and contributes to 
performance-related compensation. 

Corporate Initiative for  Project Management 
Development 

The organization is actively staffing and  providing a 
complete training curriculum for  each of the 
different project-related  roles from project manager 
to  project sponsor to scheduler, etc. Additional 
project-related positions are defined by the 
organization for those who have the ability and 
interest to go beyond the general management of 
projects (thus are considered positions above that of 
project manager) to  project management process 
expert, project management methodologist, and

project management mentor/advisor. A 
compensation package  for  each  role is in place and 
is based upon performance measurements a s 
defined in the role competency. Individuals are 
motivated based upon the career progression within 
the project management track, the incentives built 
into the system for  successful  project performance, 
and the customer satisfaction.

An improvement procedure exists whereby the project 
management human resource planning processes and 
standards are periodically reviewed and enhancements are 
incorporated. Project teams identify and  support 
improvements to the process. A t the conclusion of each 
project, lessons learned are captured, evaluated, and 
incorporated into the process  to improve the process and 
documentation. Management is  actively involved in the 
resource management and prioritization process and 
reviews and  supports improvements. Functional line 
management of other corporate processes and systems are 
aware, support,  and involved in overall resource pool 
management and prioritization for  projects and 
maintenance requirements. Resource  pool management 
and the prioritization process are integrated such that 
management can see how resources are being utilized to 
ensure high productivity of resources. Project team 
evaluations and performance reporting contribute to 
overall project  efficiency and effectiveness  for enhanced 
resource utilization and corporate career path  standards. 

Organizational  Planning 

Organizational planning is evaluated on a periodic 
basis and enhancements to the process are 
continuously incorporated. Performance metrics for 
human resources are utilized to define efficiency 
and effectiveness of resource utilization throughout 
the project. Stakeholder analysis effectiveness and 
efficiency  is evaluated to ensure continuous 
involvement and sign-off throughout the project. 
Integrated decision-making (whereby all decisions 

Project Manag em en t  Ma tu r i t y Model

are evaluated with regard to their impact on other 
pr9jects)  occurs in all projects.  Lessons learned are 
captured for  effective organizational planning. 

Staff  Acquisition 

Enterprise resource forecasting is evaluated for 
continuous improvement and enhancements. The 
project manager resource requests are evaluated 
against the resource pool constraints and 
prioritization to ensure maximization of resource 
utilization in effectiveness and efficiency.  Resource 
variance reports measure performance metrics of 
efficiency and effectiveness. Enterprise resource 
forecasting is being utilized. Lessons learned about 
the effectiveness of acquiring resources are 
captured. 

Team  Development 

The organization values investing in its people 
throughout the organization and actively ensures 
that project teams have all that is required to 
succeed on a regular basis.  The question is 
continually asked (especially at project end): Are 
there ways in  which  we could get better team buy- 
i n ? This information is used to improve the overall 
process.  Team member training needs are forecasted 
and acknowledged a s value-added investment for 
the organization. Project  conflict management 
process is integrated into the overall corporate 
management system and efficiency and effectiveness 
measurements are gathered. Team satisfaction is 
measured. Lessons learned about effective means of 
developing team synergy are captured.

Improvement procedures are in  place and utilized. 
Lessons  learned are regularly  examined and used to 
improve documented processes.  Projects are given 
high value within the organization; thus there is high 
visibility  to the individuals who are  actively  involved 
in projects on a regular  basis.  Projects are directly  tied 
to  the  success of the organization; thus there is a 
financial  tie  to  success of the organization and the 
project-related  positions that are responsible  for 
successful  project  performance. 

Individual Project Management Knowledge 

An improvement process  is in place  to continuously

Project  Communications 
Management 

T” OVERALL PURPOSE of communications management is 
to manage the project data process from collection  to 
categorization to dissemination to utilization and decision- 
making. 

Components 

Communications  Planning 

The purpose of communications planning is  to 
determine the information and communications 
needs of all the project stakeholders, such as who, 
what, when, where, and  how. 

Information Distribution 

This refers to the method or means of making 
information available  to the project stakeholders, 
including retrieval and distribution systems. 

Performance  Reporting

Issues  Tracking and Management 

What kind of issues-tracking and management 
processes are in place?  Are they regularly used? Are 
issues really evaluated/prioritized or are they 
merely listed? Is there regular follow-up and 
reporting?

Initial Process 

There is an  ad hoc communications process in place 
whereby projects are expected  to provide informal status to 
management, when called upon to do so. 

Communications Planning 

There are no established standards  in place  for 
communications planning. However, it  is  expected 
that the project manager can provide a  status on the 
project  to management, when required. 

Information  Distribution 

Information is distributed in an ad hoc manner, as a 
response to a specific request or question about the 
project directed to the project manager. 

Performance  Reporting 

Informal reporting about the current status of the 
project  can be obtained from the project manager. 

Issues Tracking and  Management 

Issues are handled on an ad hoc basis and may be 
discussed in meetings.

Structured  Process and Standards 

A basic communications management process  is 
established whereby stakeholder communication needs  and 
project constraints and assumptions are identified, project 
status  and progress reporting are distributed on a regular 
basis, and there is a notification of phase and overall project 
completion. Large, highly visible  projects are encouraged to 
follow the process and there is documentation supporting 
how the process should work. Management understands 
the need for regular communication of project  activities in 
order to have  the needed information to make good 
decisions and  supports the collection of project status. The 
focus  for communications is  on summary  status  and 
progress reporting for the triple constraint items (scope- 
schedule-cost). Projects are launched through project 
requests from a client. 
At this level the following activities (including 
components below) are required for large and highly 
visible  projects, and encouraged for other projects: 
Applying the detailed communications management 
process, including analyzing the communications 
requirements and technology parameters 
Identifying the communication vehicles used to 
exchange information 
Baselining the project triple-constraint parameters. 

Formal  acceptance from the customer is obtained for 
project deliverables. The communications management 
process  is fully documented and the process  is repeatable. 
Communications templates exist and are readily accessible 
and integrated with other project planning elements. 

Project Commun ica t ions  Managemen t 

Management values the output of communications 
management and requires utilization of project 
management tools and techniques to communicate project 
outcomes and the triple constraint parameters. 

- 

157 

Communications  Planning 

An informal stakeholder analysis is developed 
whereby project stakeholders are identified and 
provided project summary reports for status, 
progress, or phase completion. Project constraints 
and assumptions are developed. Management 
encourages large and highly visible  projects  to 
provide these summary reports at periodic intervals 
through the expected  life of the project. A formal 
stakeholder analysis is conducted and 
communication requirements are defined by 
combining the type and format of information 
required with an analysis of the value of that 
information. A communications management plan is 
developed by large and highly visible  projects and 
encouraged by all  projects.  The communication plan 
identifies the communication needs from project 
commencement to closure, including the post- 
project review at the end of the project, where 
lessons learned are gathered. The following 
communication technology  factors are analyzed: 
Immediacy of the need for information 
Availability of technology 
Expected  project staffing 
Length of the project 
Project  risks.

Information Distribution 

Information is distributed via either electronic 
medium or hard-copy documentation (which is 
hand-delivered or mailed  to the stakeholders). Basic 
retrieval and distribution process  is in place. 
Effective interteam communication retrieval of 
project actuals is established. Project stakeholders 
are directed to a specific shared file on a computer 
network or central physical  location, where they can 
retrieve needed project information. The  project 
manager is responsible for ensuring that project 
information is retrieved in a timely fashion and  that 
the stakeholders obtain the information that they 
need. 

Performance  Reporting 

Three types of summary reports for status, progress 
and phase completion can be produced throughout 
the life of the project at periodic intervals of project 
timeline. These reports track  milestone attainment of 
scheduled items. The  project has been baselined and 
actuals can be collected.  The three consolidated 
reports from integration (status reports, progress 
reports, or phase project completion reports) contain 
information about how many hours or dollars have 
been spent on the project  activities, how much of the 
overall time has been spent on the project  activities, 
and the technical performance of the project. A 
formal acceptance document is being used for the 
customer to acknowledge acceptance of project 
deliverables. At the conclusion of the project there is 
a formal customer sign-off. 

Project Commun ica t ion s  Managemen t 

Issues  Tracking and Management 

There is a documented issues management process 
in place, whereby issues are collected, documented, 
managed, and  brought to a conclusion.  This  process 
is  followed at times and encouraged by large and 
highly visible  projects, but is not enforced. Project 
deliverable completion and formal  acceptance as 
well as project closure are reported. Not only is the 
issues management process in place, but it  is 
consistently followed  on large and highly visible 
projects. Management expects  to be involved with 
the resolution of issues for large and highly visible 
projects, in the form of either notice or escalation, 
and also encourages involvement for other projects.

Level 3 
Organizational Standards and 
Institutionalized Process 

The communications management process has been 
institutionalized and  a formal communications 
management plan is expected for most projects, including 
conducting informal variance/ trend analysis. Management 
is  actively involved in reviewing and acting upon 
communications reports from individual projects.  Project 
performance reviews are conducted. Key management is 
involved in reviewing and  approving any changes that 
impact the triple constraints. 

Communications Planning 

A communications plan is  expected  for  all  projects. 

Information  Distribution 

There is a formal information retrieval system by 
which project stakeholders can retrieve information 
through  an electronic  text database or central 
repository (physical or electronic). There is a formal 
information distribution system including project 
meetings, hard copy documentation, shared access 
to networked electronic databases, fax,  electronic 
mail, and voice  mail. 

Performance  Reporting 

Graphical performance reporting charts are used, 
such as S-curves (which indicate how  the  funds or 
hours are being spent), histograms, and tables,  in 
addition to narrative reporting of project status  and 
progress. In addition, informal variance/trend 
analysis can be conducted comparing the actual 

Project Commun ica t ion s  Managemen t 

project results to the planned results, and trend 
analysis is done to determine the estimate-to- 
complete for budget and schedule parameters. At 
this stage the analysis is informal because the 
estimates and actuals do not result from  close 
integration with other corporate systems. 
Management is involved in the identification, 
analysis, approval (or not) of changes to the project 
plan. Performance reviews are conducted to assess 
project status or progress. Project reports are 
archived for future reference. 

Issues  Tracking and Management 

Issues are consistently addressed during regular, 
full-team meetings. The  client  area  is part of 
determining issues and coming up with proposed 
resolutions and actions.

CHAPTER 1 0 

Project R isk Management 

T”” OVERALL PURPOSE of risk management is  to identify, 
analyze, respond, and control risk factors throughout 
the life of a project. Risk management is understanding the 
risk events, assessing their impact on the project, 
determining the best way to deal with them, developing 
and executing a plan, and monitoring progress. 

Components 

Risk Identification 

Risk identification  involves determining which  risks 
are likely  to have an impact on the  project and 
documenting the characteristics of each  item.  The 
main products of this  component are potential risk 
events and risk  triggers. 

Risk Quantification 

Risk quantification covers evaluating the risks and 
assessing the potential outcomes. Risk quantification 
includes examining all identified risks; determining 
the interactions, relationships, and implications to 
the project; developing probabilities of occurrence; 
determining which  risks warrant response; and 
assessing the range of possible  project outcomes. 

Project Manag em en t  Ma tu r i t y Model 

- 

168 

The main product is a prioritized list of quantified 
risk events. 

Risk  Response Development 

Risk response involves defining the steps to 
managing the risks. It includes determining how 
best to respond and establish contingency plans, 
reserves, and agreements necessary  to contain the 
risks. Planning strategies are developed to avoid, 
mitigate, or accept  risks. Risk response includes the 
development of a risk management plan, project 
reserves, and mitigation strategies. 

Risk Control 

Risk control involves controlling risks, making 
decisions on how to handle each situation, and 
taking corrective  action. Risk control is seeing a risk 
concern, deciding how to handle it, and carrying out 
the decision. Risks are controlled in accordance with 
the risk management plan and established 
procedures. The main products are a risk  log, 
corrective  actions, and  updates to the risk 
management plan. 

Risk Documentation 

Risk documentation involves establishing a project 
database to  collect historical information on the risks 
encountered and related experiences.  The main 
products from this component include a historical 
database and postproject assessment. 

Project R isk Management 

Level 1 

Initial Process 

There  is  recognition of the need for  accepted  processes, but 
there are  no established practices or standards. Individual 
teams or  parts of the organization may have their own way 
of doing things in an ad hoc, informal fashion. 
Documentation of the processes  is  loose and makes it 
difficult  to repeat the activities elsewhere. Management is 
aware that risk management has importance, but action in 
this area is more reactive than proactive. 

Risk Identification 

Risks are not identified as a normal practice. 
However, individuals may discuss items of special 
interest to management or stakeholders. However, 
these discussions typically  take  place when the risk 
is already a current problem versus a  future 
possibility. To help identify risks, the project 
manager will generally have a scope statement and  a 
WBS that consists of a basic set of milestones and 
occasionally deliverables. The  project manager may 
also have a top-level  milestone schedule. There may 
be sporadic "risk" discussions on the project scope 
and milestone information, but only on an  ad hoc 
basis. 

Risk Quantification 

If risks are identified, the project manager may 
speculate on the impact to the project if the risks 
occur. The speculation is  typically done in an 
impromptu situation without any analysis, 
forethought, or standard  approach/process. 

Project Manag em en t  Ma tu r i t y Mode l 

- 

170 Risk  Response Development 

In large part, risks are considered as they arise. 
Teams seldom determine mitigation strategies or 
plan for  contingencies  for future risk events. 

Risk Control 

At this point, project teams do more day-to-day 
problem solving if a new risk event arises 
(developing workarounds) versus working with a 
risk management plan and identifying additional 
risk response strategies. 

Risk Documentation 

There is no historical database on  typical risks 
encountered and related experiences. Individual 
team members rely upon their own past experiences 
and discussions with the project  team. 

Project R isk Managemen t 

Level 2 

Structured  Process and Standards 

Risk management processes are developed and 
documented for identifying, quantifying, developing a risk 
response, and reporting risks.  Project team members 
generally understand macro- and some detail-level risks, 
and most  projects are expected  to determine strategies for 
dealing with the risks.  Teams use a  structured approach to 
quantify the impact of the risks  in an effort to rank their 
importance. Risk lists are compiled  to  track and monitor 
progress. The  risk management processes are considered 
standard practice for large, visible  projects, and 
recommended for  all other projects. All documented 
processes are repeatable. Management supports risk 
management, but they are only consistently involved on 
large, visible  projects and involved in other projects if the 
risk  critical and is of great magnitude. Risks are examined 
and controlled on a project-by-project basis. 

Risk Identification 

The organization has a documented process for 
identifying project  risks. The process  is encouraged 
for  all  projects, but is only considered standard 
practice on large, highly visible  projects. A conscious 
effort  is made to identify total project risks (near- 
term and longer-term in as much detail as makes 
sense). Risk discussions include input from key 
stakeholders. To help identify risks, the project team 
will generally have  a scope statement and a WBS 
template that goes down to at least  level three, a 
more detailed project schedule, and  a more 
comprehensive project  cost estimate. The  project 
team will  also  examine the procurement 

Project Managemen t  Ma tu r i ty Model 

172 

management plan and staff management plan to 
help identify risks. The risk discussions typically 
focus on project  scope, schedule, and cost  risks, and 
top-level  risks are included in the project team 
project plan. The  project team relies upon expert 
judgment and known industry lessons learned to 
identify risks. 

R isk Quantification 

A process is in place that is documented which 
provides a more structured approach to quantifying 
risks. The  process includes a standard methodology 
that will ensure the organization consistently 
assesses the risk items. The common methodology 
may include low-medium-high ratings or expected 
monetary value of risks using simple probability 
and value calculations.  Project teams attempt to 
employ more objective approaches to quantify the 
probability that a risk event will  occur and the 
significance of the impact if it does occur.  Risks are 
still evaluated on a project-by-project basis and  are 
typically prioritized based upon a single factor such 
a s monetary value considerations. 

R isk Response Development 

Project teams may informally think about their 
strategy for dealing with future risk events and 
discuss the strategies among themselves. The 
strategies may include avoiding the risk, mitigating 
it, or accepting it altogether. As part of the risk 
management process, the organization has the 
project teams develop a risk management plan that 
documents the procedures that will be used to 
manage risk. The plan will  cover things such as  who 

Project R isk Managemen t 

- 

173 

is  responsible, how the information will be 
maintained, how plans will be implemented, and 
how reserves will be distributed. The plan is 
provided for integration and consolidation into the 
project plan. Large, highly visible  projects are 
developing contingency plans for near-term risks 
and mitigation strategies for all risk areas of concern. 

Risk Control 
During project  execution, individual project teams 
and segments of the organization apply their own 
approach to managing and controlling risks. Project 
teams typically assign responsibility for  each  risk 
item as it  occurs. That responsibility may include 
providing a recommendation about how to handle 
the risk and taking corrective action. Risks  may be 
discussed in team staff meetings and the status is 
documented in meeting minutes. Management is 
generally informed about the risk status of large, 
highly visible  projects. A process  is developed and 
documented to report risk status to  key 
stakeholders. The  process may include a risk log that 
identifies the risk items, who  is responsible, the 
potential impact, the probability of impact, the 
mitigation strategy, and the current status. Project 
teams may hold periodic meetings specifically  for 
risk discussions to  track and manage the risks and to 
discuss current status, workarounds,  and corrective 
actions, as needed. The organization collects  metrics 
to  track things such a s the number of risk items and 
levels of concern  (e.g., high, medium, low). The  risk 
status is distributed to  key stakeholders and 
incorporated into the project schedule.

174 Risk Documentation 
Individuals may have collected some "historical" 
information about general tendencies in risk, but the 
information is not typically  collected and 
centralized. The organization process includes the 
establishment of a historical database to  collect  risk 
information such a s typical risks on similar projects. 

Project Risk Managemen t 

Level 3 
Organizational Standards and 
lnstitutionalized Process 

The risk  processes are considered an organizational 
standard  and are being utilized by nearly all  projects.  The 
risk identification process  is expanded to include efficient 
ways for teams to identify risks (e.g.,  checklists, automated 
forms,  etc.).  In addition, teams are asked to identify 
symptoms of risk (risk triggers) for incorporation into the 
historical database. The  risk quantification process is 
expanded to identify more advanced procedures for 
quantifying risks and multiple criteria to prioritize risk 
items. The  risk response development process is enhanced 
with templates. All  processes are repeatable. A risk control 
system is developed and established. Systems are becoming 
more integrated: risk information and  status is provided to 
project integration. Metrics are collected and analyzed, such 
as the types of risks and success rate in mitigating the 
items. Management fully supports the risk management 
processes and  has institutionalized the procedures and 
standards. Risks are examined and controlled on a program 
basis. 

Risk Identification 

The organization has  a documented, repeatable 
process for identifying project  risks, which is fully 
implemented. Documentation exists on all  processes 
and  standards for identifying risk events. The 
process  is expanded to include efficient avenues for 
teams to identify risks (e.g.,  checklists, automated 
forms, etc.). In addition, teams are to identify 
symptoms of risk (risk triggers) for incorporation 
into the historical database for risks. A conscious 

Project Manag em en t  Ma tu r i t y Model 

effort is made to identify total  project risks and 
program risks (interrelationships among related 
projects). Risk discussions include input from past, 
similar projects, industry lessons learned, and key 
stakeholders. Risk information and  symptoms are 
consolidated and integrated. 

Risk Quantification 

The  risk quantification process is further expanded 
to identify more advanced procedures for 
quantifying risks and multiple criteria to prioritize 
risk items. The entire process  is  fully documented 
and repeatable. The more advanced process  may 
include methodologies such as range predictions, 
optimal calculations using simulation tools and 
decision  trees, and weighted average calculations. 
Risks are typically prioritized using multiple factors 
such as expected monetary value, criticality, timing, 
and risk type. Risks are evaluated on a  program/ 
organizational basis. 

Risk  Response Development 

The risk response development process  is expanded 
to include templates for the risk management plan. 
At this point, the project teams typically have 
contingency plans and mitigation strategies 
identified for  each  risk item. Consequently, the 
organization is capable of allocating  project reserves 
to  cover such items. 

Risk Control 

A process is  fully developed and utilized for 
managing and controlling risk. Project risks are 
actively, routinely tracked. Corrective actions are 

Project Risk Management 

taken, the risk management plan is updated  as risk 
events take place and /o r things change, and project 
plans  are adjusted accordingly. Metrics are collected, 
analyzed, and may be expanded to include success 
rate at mitigating risks.

consideration of how similar projects performed in the past 
and  what  is expected for the future. Management uses 
efficiency and effectiveness metrics to make decisions 
regarding the project. All projects,  changes, and issues are 
evaluated based upon metrics from cost estimates, baseline 
estimates, and earned value. The  metrics are used to 
understand the performance of a project during execution 
for making management decisions  for the future.

Project  Procurement 
Management 

P ROCUREMENT MANAGEMENT IS the processes and actions 
undertaken by the project manager and /o r project team 
to acquire goods and services in support of the project.  It 
also includes activities  in managing the contract throughout 
the period of performance and closing the contract upon 
completion. All these processes and actions must be taken 
within the constraints of the organizational structure  and 
policies of the overall organization. Generally the process 
involves contracting with an outside vendor to acquire 
goods and services  in a timely manner, in the appropriate 
quantity, and within a defined quality standard. In fact, the 
term "contracting"  is  often used interchangeably with 
"procurement." 

Components 

Procurement  Planning 

Procurement planning involves determining 
whether to procure or produce in-house, deciding 
how to procure, identifying what  and  how much to 
procure, and determining when to procure. If any 
goods or services are to be acquired from outside the 

Project Managemen t  Ma tu r i ty Model 

- 

184 

project  team, the specifications should  be laid out  in 
detail, along with the major  milestones, timing/ 
scheduling, initial cost estimate, and  budget impact. 
The outcome of this component is the procurement 
management plan. 

Requisition 

Requisition bridges the gap between identifying 
requirements and contracting with the outside 
world. It includes identifying potential vendors, 
determining solicitation type (oral or verbal, 
invitation for bid, request for proposal, etc.), 
determining the type of contract, developing 
procurement documents, etc.  The outcome of this 
component is a solicitation package. 

Solicitation/Source Selection 

This process involves finding the right vendor and 
negotiating the contract for goods and services.  It 
includes soliciting information from industry, 
receiving the bids/proposals, evaluating the 
information, negotiating the contract, and finalizing 
the contract award. The outcome of this component 
is the award of the contract. 

Contract Management/Closute 

This includes actions involved with vendor 
management during contract performance, 
acceptance by the client, payment for  services, and 
close-out  activities.  The purpose is  to assure that the 
seller performs in accordance with the terms of the 
contract and receives proper reimbursement (in both 
quantity  and timing). 

Project Procurement  Management 

Level 1 

Initial Process 

There is no project procurement process in place, but the 
organization does recognize that there may be value in 
having a defined procurement process.  Some  project 
managers recognize the need to go through the process of 
procuring outside goods and services in a methodical 
manner, although these methods are ad hoc and 
inconsistently performed. Contracts are managed at a final 
delivery level. 

Procurement  Planning 

There is no recognized practice  for procurement 
planning within a project. However, occasionally 
(on an ad hoc basis) a project manager will 
determine basic requirements and timing from the 
milestones and deliverables list and will then plot 
out a planned approach to purchasing goods and 
services ahead of time. 

Requisition 

Basically,  project requisitions are prepared in a 
manner similar to the way the organization prepares 
documentation to acquire more typical goods and 
services.  There  is no uniquely established approach 
for making acquisitions for  projects. 

Solicitation/Source Selection 

There is no  standard or  practice in place  for vendor 

contact/evaluation/negotiation. Occasionally the 

organization will go through a process of contacting 
several vendors, shopping  and comparing prices. 

Project Manag em en t  Ma tu r i t y Model 

- 

186 Contract  Managernent/Closure 

Contracts for  projects are loosely managed with 
minimal reporting requirements delineated within 
the contract. In large part, vendors/contractors  are 
managed to end dates only. 

Project  Procurement  Management 

Level 2 

Structured Process and Standards 

There is a basic  process documented for procurement of 
goods and services from outside the organization, but this 
process is not a  standard practice. Its use by large or highly 
visible  projects  is encouraged. The procurement 
organization drives the process with some input from the 
project team, organizational management, and the client. 
The  process  for procurement is considered standard 
practice for large, highly visible  projects, and all other 
projects are encouraged to use it. The  process is specific and 
documented. Organizational management is more 
involved, with  input from the client department. The 
process involves the project team and capitalizes upon its 
technical knowledge. Contracts are managed at an 
appropriate level of detail with regular periodic reporting. 

Procurement  Planning 

The  basic  process  specifies that the project manager 
decides whether to  make or buy the goods/services 
in question after  receiving a project request. This  is 
done  in the process of creating a statement of work / 
product description. This statement of work/ 
product description is sent to the scope management 
process,  which prepares and  returns  a scope 
statement. The  project manager (and possibly team 
members) go through  an  informal analysis whether 
to  "make or buy" the goods and services in question 
with  input from the client department. This analysis 
is  heavily based upon the scope statement. They 
make a recommendation to organizational 
management. In the case where organizational 
management makes the decision  to proceed with 

Project  Management Maturity Model 

- 

188 

buying goods/services, the procurement 
organization and the project team jointly create the 
procurement management plan. This plan identifies 
items such as how to procure, what, how much, 
when, what deliverables, the quality necessary  for 
these deliverables (based upon the project’s quality 
standards),  and timing for these deliverables. 

Requisition 

This scope statement is  reviewed  (changed if 
necessary), and if the decision is to build the product 
internally, a scope approval is returned to the  scope 
management process. If the decision  is  to buy the 
goods/services in question  from an outside vendor, 
the procurement organization  takes the lead on 
deciding which vendor(s) to  contact.  The 
procurement organization  also  takes the lead  on 
preparing the procurement documentation with 
limited  participation  from the project team. The 
project team becomes more involved in the 
preparation of the procurement documentation. A 
process is defined  for  identifying  contract 
requirements, identifying potential vendors, selecting 
the appropriate contract  type, determining the best 
procurement approach, and developing procurement 
documentation. The  organization  establishes  clear 
evaluation  criteria  for  use during proposal 
evaluation. 
The procurement approach will  vary, but the 
organization has defined the different types for use 
by the project  teams: 

Pro jec t  Procuremen t  Managemen t 

Unilateral 

189 

Purchase Order (PO)-usually 
is  used  when 
routine, standard cost items are needed. Sent  to 
the seller with the expectation that it  will  accept 
it automatically. 

Bilateral 

Request  for Quotation (RFQ)-usually used 
when the goods and services are of relatively low 
dollar value, such as supplies and materials. 
Request  for Proposal (RFP)-usually used when 
there is a high dollar value involved and the 
goods and services are not standardized. This 
would be when the project team has developed 
the requirements for the  product,  but  has  not 
done a detailed design of the product. 
Invitation to Bid-usually used for high-dollar- 
value, "standard" goods and services.  Use of this 
approach depends  upon a clear and accurate 
description of the goods and services; in other 
words, the project team must have a thoroughly 
documented design of the product, which will be 
conveyed to the potential vendor(s). 

Large, highly visible  projects use the process to 
obtain contract services for projects. 

Solicitation/Source Selection 

Usually, the procurement organization  contacts  the 
vendor(s) and conducts price  comparisons.  The 
vendor(s) is  asked  to  commit  to 
the final  delivery date 
for the services with key  milestones. No specific 
quality standards are detailed for the vendor. The 

Project Managemen t  Ma tu r i ty Model 

- 

190 

vendor(s) is  asked  for a project plan at an appropriate 
level of detail.  The quality to be met in the product is 
specified to the vendor, based upon the project's 
quality standards. Both the project  manager and the 
purchasing department are involved in the evaluation 
of the bids/proposals, using the established 
evaluation  criteria. A process  is  defined to solicit 
information  from industry, evaluate the information, 
negotiate the contract, and finalize  contract award. 
The  process  is used on  large, highly visible  projects. 

Contract  Management/Closure 

The vendor is expected to supply to the project 
manager periodic status reports that reflect progress 
toward meeting key  milestones; no specific format 
or frequency has been specified in the basic process. 
Changes to the plan may represent a scope change, 
in which case the normal change management 
process within the project integration process is used 
for large, highly visible  projects. 
Formal  acceptance and contract closure 
occurs, but a standard process  is not established or 
documented. The vendor reports on a regular basis 
(usually weekly) on the reporting level agreed upon 
in the contract. The format of this reporting is 
specified in the procurement process, and the 
reporting frequency is per the procurement 
management plan and contract. Information on 
work results is provided to the project integration 
management process  for internal progress reporting. 
In the case where there is a change to the plan (e.g., 
date slippage), the project manager sends corrective 
action information to the project integration 
management process, resulting in plan updates. 

- 

191 

Project  Procurement Managemen t 

Corrective action information and other 
changes are sent to the project integration 
management process, resulting in project plan 
updates or use of the change control process within 
the project integration process. 
A process  is established and documented for 
formal acceptance and contract closure.  Typically 
closure information and formal acceptance  is 
provided to the communication process.

192 

Level 3 

Organizational Standards and 
Institutionalized Process 

The procurement process  is considered an organizational 
standard,  and is used by nearly all projects.  The  client  is 
directly and integrally involved in the analysis and decision 
to make or buy. The procurement is run with a much more 
program view-that  is, management views other projects 
and  products in the program in making their  decisions. The 
project team and purchasing department are now fully 
integrated in the procurement process. Contractors/ 
vendors are asked to comply with applicable project 
management processes and  structure that are standard 
throughout the organization. 

Procurement  Planning 

The  project team and procurement organization 
present a formal analysis/recommendation report to 
both organizational management and client 
management. The make/buy recommendation and 
decision  takes into account  effects and ramifications 
in such areas a s capacity of the organization, most 
economical method, economic  factors, organization 
situations, etc.  The make/buy decision  is made 
jointly  by organizational management and client 
management. 

Requisition 

The organization has developed an expeditious 
process  to  access vendors/contractors (for example, 
a preferred bidders list). Any vendor 
recommendations from the project team should 

- 

193 

Project Procuremen t  Managemen t 

come from, or be added to, this list.  The process for 
developing procurement documentation is 
expanded to include procurement templates such as 
a statement of work format, status reporting, and 
other common procurement attachments. The 
organization has identified the types of contracts. 

The type of contract will vary, but the organization 
has defined the different types for use by the project 
teams: 
Firm-fixed-price-used when reasonably definite 
product specifications are available and costs are 
relatively certain. The team has done  a detailed 
job of designing the product. 
Fixed-price-plus-incentive-fee-used when the 
contract is  for a substantial sum  and involves a 
long delivery period. 
Cost-plus-incentive-fee-used when the contract 
involves a long delivery period with substantial 
amount of hardware development and test 
requirements. 
Cost-plus-fixed-fee-used primarily for research 
projects where the effort required for  successful 
completion is uncertain until well after the 
signing of the contract. 
Cost-plus-percentage-of-cost-rarely used. 

Solicitation/Source Selection 

Contractors/vendors are asked to  comply with 
applicable project management processes and 
structure that is standard  throughout the 
organization. Vendors are asked to supply a detailed 

Project Manag em en t  Ma tu r i t y Model 

- 

194 

plan, including a WBS and detailed, sequenced 
activity  list, in line with the project’s structure. 
Solicitation  is carried out jointly  by the purchasing 
department  and the project  team, with  input from 
the legal department. 

Contract  Management/Closure 

The vendor reports in a timely manner (generally 
weekly or monthly depending  upon the length of 
the project and frequency of contract deliverables) to 
the project manager against progress on the detailed 
sequenced activity  list.  Any changes/issues are 
communicated immediately to the project manager, 
who  forwards them to the change management 
process,  which  is  fully implemented within the 
project. 
The  client  is integrally involved in testing of 
the product  and signs off on contract completion. 
After the client has signed off on the acceptability  of 
the procured items, and all appropriate 
documentation from the vendor has been received, 
the project manager signs off on the contract and 
closure actions  take  place. 

Pro jec t  Procuremen t  Managemen t 

Level 4 

Managed Process 

Organizational management now mandates compliance 
with the procurement process  for all projects. Make/buy 
decisions are now made  with  an organizational perspective. 
The vendor is integrated into the organization’s reporting 
mechanisms. Audits of the procurement process are 
performed to provide insight into how procurement actions 
may be improved. 

Procurement  Planning 

The make/buy decision  is made by a team 
composed of the project manager, organizational 
management, client management, and the 
purchasing department. This decision includes 
organizational factors such as available production 
capacity in other parts of the organization, 
ramifications on other active projects, ramifications 
on other parts of the organizational environment, 
etc. Input  is requested from all areas affected by the 
project or its product(s). 

Requisition 

The  project’s requisitions are fully integrated with 
the organization’s requisition process. 

Solicitation/Source  Selection 

Solicitation and source selection  for the project are 
fully integrated with the organization’s solicitation 
process. In this manner, it  is possible for the 
organization to leverage numerous requests to a 
given vendor and take advantage of economies of 
scale. 

Project Managemen t  Ma tu r i ty Mode l

196 Contract  Management/Closure 

The vendor is required to report progress against 
plan using the organization’s standard project 
management tools and techniques. Weekly status 
reports are provided from the vendor to the project 
manager, who integrates them into the 
organization’s standard  status reporting 
mechanisms. In addition, vendors are more 
integrated into the project planning activities.

Optimizing Process 

- 

197 

An improvement procedure exists whereby the project 
management procurement processes and  standards are 
periodically reviewed and enhancements are incorporated. 
The  project manager and project teams identify and 
support improvements to the process. At the conclusion of 
each  project, lessons learned are captured, evaluated, and 
incorporated into the process to improve the process and 
documentation. The procurement process is evaluated 
based upon efficiency and effectiveness  metrics. 
Management is  actively involved in obtaining strategic 
alliances with  approved vendors who  have a reputation for 
delivering high-quality products or services in a timely 
manner  and  supports improvements to the process for  just- 
in-time delivery. 

Procurement Planning 

Procurement planning is evaluated on a periodic 
basis, and enhancements to the process are 
continuously incorporated. The make/buy decision 
is evaluated based upon efficiency and effectiveness 
metrics.  Historical data about projected make/buy 
costs are evaluated against actual costs to determine 
if the decisions were sound  and  should  be repeated 
in the future. Just-in-time procurement is 
incorporated to expedite the procurement planning 
process and reduce inventory carrying costs  for the 
organization.

198 Requisition 

The requisition process  is evaluated on  a periodic 
basis and enhancements to the process are 
continuously incorporated. The requisition process 
is automated and triggered by a project manager 
request. The  process  is evaluated based upon 
efficiency and effectiveness  metrics.  The 
organization has preferred contract  vehicles and  a 
list of preferred vendors who can respond to the 
requisition process expeditiously. 

Solicitation/Source  Selection 

Solicitation/source selection is evaluated on a 
periodic basis and enhancements to the process are 
continuously incorporated. Contractors are 
evaluated based upon effectiveness and efficiency 
metrics with regard to  project performance. The 
project manager and project team evaluate the 
vendors  at the end of the project in terms of 
effectiveness,  efficiency, responsiveness, timeliness, 
and quality of product/service. The results of these 
evaluations are fed  back into the process and 
measured against the preferred providers list. 

Contract  Management/Closure 

Contract management/closure is evaluated on a 
periodic basis and enhancements to the process are 
continuously incorporated. The organization 
considers strategic alliances with preferred vendors. 
Both organizations adhere to a high standard of 
project performance and quality in their products or 
services. Captured on large and highly visible 
projects are lessons learned about the procurement 
process within the project with regard to 

Project  Procurement Managemen t 

effectiveness and efficiency (e.g., processing 
procurement documentation, having evaluation 
criteria  to  select a source, and the length of time to 
process a change order). A performance database 
exists  to capture performance information on the 
vendors/contractors.

Project  Management Maturity 
Self-Assessment  Survey 

T HIS SELF-ASSESSMENT survey is designed to help you 
perform a simple, informal self-assessment of your 
organization's project management maturity. More detailed 
information about assessments and how to use them is 
found  in Chapter 1. Follow the directions below  to perform 
your self-assessment. You may  also want to compare your 
results to the industry survey results listed in Appendix B. 
Remember that the primary purpose of a project 
management maturity assessment is  to provide a  path for 
your organization to  move forward in improving its project 
management capabilities. 

To assess your  organization's  project  management 
maturity: 

Review the description for each component in each of  the  nine knowledge 
areas  (see  Chapters 2- 1 11, and assess your level of maturity. Check the 
appropriate boxes in the survey. 

Achievement of a given maturity level by an organization is cumuafiw-that 
is, for each  succeeding PMMM Level, the assumption is that all criteria for the 
preceding levels for that component are being (or have been] fulfilled. So for 
you  to assess yourself at Level 3 in Scope Definition,  for example, you must 
have in place all o f the processes  described in Levels 1,2, and 3 o f Scope 
Definition. You may  have some of the processes in place in Level 4, bu t if you 
don't have  all of those  processes in place, you are a t Level 3. 

After you have completed your assessment of the knowledge area 
components, determine your maturity level in each knowledge area.  To do 
that. review your assessments of  the knowledge area  components, and pick 
the lowest level that you've assessed yourself-that i s your level of maturity

in that knowledge area.  For  example, i f your component self-assessment is 
as shown in Figure A. 1, then your maturity level in project scope 
management is Level 2 (because you are at Level 2 maturity in business 
requirements definition). 

To  assess your overall  Organizational Maturity Level, follow a similar 
method. Review your maturity assessment of each o f the nine knowledge 
areas.  Pick the lowest level that you’ve assessed yourself-that is your 
Organizational Maturity Level.  For  example, if your knowledge area  self- 
assessment is as shown in Figure A.2, then your overall Organizational 
Maturity Level is Level 1 .

Project  Management Maturity 
Benchmark  Survey  Excerpt 

0 RGANIZATIONS ARE AT the bottom rungs of the project 
management maturity ladder,  and they have 
particularly immature risk management processes.  These 
conclusions are among the results of a survey of 126 senior- 
level  project management practitioners by the Center for 
Business  Practices, the research arm of the consulting and 
training organization PM Solutions,  Inc.  The  Project 
Management Maturity Benchmark survey asked 
organizations to  self-assess  their  project management 
maturity using a model developed to enable them to 
measure their maturity in project management processes 
generally accepted as crucial  to  successful  project 
completion. 
The CBP surveyed senior practitioners with 
knowledge of their organizations’ project management 
practices and their organizations’ business results. The 
survey used PM Solutions’  Project Management Maturity 
Model in the assessment. The model describes how 
organizations mature as they improve their project 
management processes. As such, it is a useful framework 
for organizations wishing to improve their project 
management processes. 
Survey results document the maturity level of 
organizations in the 9 knowledge areas, as well a s 42 
specific components that make up those knowledge areas. 

Project Manag em en t  Ma tu r i t y Model 

- 

206 The results present a baseline of project management 
maturity in organizations. The report documents the project 
management maturity model in a way that organizations 
can use to perform a self-assessment and compare their 
maturity to the baseline survey. 
The survey sample was segmented according to 
company size, including small businesses with annual 
revenue under $100 million, midsize organizations with 
revenue between $100 million and $999 million, and large 
companies with annual revenue of $1 billion  or more. The

Foreword

On behalf of the Project Management Institute (PMI威) Board of Directors, I am pleased
to present PMI’s Standard for Portfolio Management.
Project management is one of those terms with multiple meanings. For a long time
it was associated only with projects, but some twenty years ago that began to change,
and today it is understood to include portfolio management and program management
as well.
Today the PMBOK威 Guide continues to be the de facto global standard for the
project management of single projects, as well as an American National Standard.
This new standard is an important step in PMI’s continuing commitment to define
the body of knowledge supporting the project management profession, and to develop
standards for its application. The Standard for Portfolio Management describes a
documented set of processes that represent generally recognized good practices in
portfolio management. Further, it details the linkage between consistent, predictable
and successful project outcomes, which accomplish or further an organization’s strate-
gic goals.
I would like to sincerely thank the globally diverse project team that worked so
diligently to bring this standard to fruition. The team, which consisted of a group of
416 PMI volunteers representing 36 countries, was led by project manager David W.
Ross, PMP, and assisted by deputy project manager Paul E. Shaltry, PMP. Dedicated
and competent volunteers continue to be the backbone of PMI’s success, and this
publication is yet another example.
I trust that each of you will find this latest addition to the PMI library of standards
beneficial to yourself as well as to your organization.

Preface

The Standard for Portfolio Management addresses the need for a documented set of
processes that represent generally recognized good practices in the discipline of portfo-
lio management. The target audience for this standard includes: senior executives,
management staff in charge of organizational strategy, portfolio managers, members
of a strategic and/or portfolio management office, managers of program managers
and project managers, customers and other stakeholders, functional managers and
process owners with resources in a portfolio, educators, consultants, trainers and
researchers. It will also be of use to program managers, project managers and other
project team members, and members of a project or program management offices.
The standard is a companion for A Guide to the Project Management Body of Knowledge
(PMBOK威 Guide) – Third Edition and builds on work postulated in the Organizational
Project Management Maturity Model (OPM3威), and provides a foundational reference
for anyone interested in portfolio management of projects and programs. While project
and program management have traditionally focused on ‘‘doing work right,’’ portfolio
management is concerned with ‘‘doing the right work.’’
Topics in this standard include:
● Streamlining operations through portfolio management;
● How portfolio management can improve the implementation and maintenance
of corporate governance initiatives;
● Portfolio management’s role within organizational structure and its relationship
to the organization’s strategy;
● Designing and implementing metrics to demonstrate and improve return on
investment; and
● Portfolio management reporting and how it can help make the most of an organi-
zation’s programs and projects.

The Standard for Portfolio Management is organized as follows:
Chapter 1 – Introduction to Portfolio Management: Defines key terms associated
with portfolio management and provides an overview of the rest of The Standard
for Portfolio Management.
Chapter 2 – Portfolio Management Process and Organization: The key components
of the portfolio management context.
Chapter 3 – Portfolio Management Processes: Identifies those Portfolio Management
Processes that have been recognized as generally accepted practices for most project
portfolios most of the time.
Appendices A – D—Provides background information on the PMI Standards Pro-
gram and The Standard for Portfolio Management project.
Glossary – Provides clarification of key terms used in developing The Standard for

Introduction to Portfolio
Management

The Standard for Portfolio Management addresses a gap in the management-by-proj-
ects field across all types of organizations (i.e., profit, nonprofit, and government)—
that is, the need for a documented set of processes that represent generally recognized
good practices in the discipline of portfolio management. While project management
and program management have traditionally focused on ‘‘doing work right,’’ portfolio
management is concerned with ‘‘doing the right work.’’
The term ‘‘portfolio’’ has been in use for some time and is used throughout many
diverse organizations; therefore, the term has come to represent different meanings.
It is recognized that there are many types and varieties of portfolios; for example, in
the financial industry, a portfolio is a collection of investment instruments (stocks,
bonds, mutual funds, commodities, etc.). This standard does not attempt to address
those types of portfolios; further, there is no attempt to bridge this standard to those
other kinds of portfolios. For the purpose of this standard, the focus is on ‘‘project
portfolio’’ management. It will be referred to simply as ‘‘portfolio’’ management.
This chapter defines key terms associated with portfolio management and provides
an overview of the rest of The Standard for Portfolio Management in the following sec-
tions:

1.1 Purpose of The Standard for Portfolio Management

The primary purpose of The Standard for Portfolio Management is to describe generally
accepted processes associated with portfolio management. This standard is an expan-
sion of information provided in A Guide to the Project Management Body of Knowledge
(PMBOK威 Guide)—Third Edition and the Organizational Project Management Maturity
Model (OPM3威). This standard focuses on portfolio management as it relates to the
disciplines of project and program management. Its application is intended for all
types of organizations (i.e., profit, nonprofit, and government). When the term ‘‘organi-
zation’’ is used here, it applies generally to these three types of organizations. If any
portion of this standard typically applies to a subset of these three types of organiza-
tions, the subset is identified.

1.1.1 Audience for The Standard for Portfolio Management

This standard provides a foundational reference for anyone interested in portfolio
management of projects and programs. This includes, but is not limited to:
● Senior executives
● Management staff in charge of organization strategy
● Portfolio managers
● Members of a strategic and/or portfolio management office
● Managers of project and program managers
● Program managers
● Project managers and other project team members
● Members of a project or program management office
● Customers and other stakeholders
● Functional managers and process owners with resources in a portfolio
● Educators teaching the management of portfolios and related subjects
● Consultants and other specialists in project, program, and portfolio management
and related fields
● Trainers developing portfolio management educational programs
● Researchers analyzing portfolio management.

1.2 What Is a Portfolio?

Defined, a portfolio is a collection of projects (temporary endeavors undertaken to
create a unique product, service, or result) and/or programs (a group of related projects
managed in a coordinated way to obtain benefits and control not available from
managing them individually) and other work that are grouped together to facilitate
the effective management of that work to meet strategic business objectives. The
components of a portfolio are quantifiable; that is, they can be measured, ranked, and
prioritized.
The projects or programs (hereinafter referred to as ‘‘components’’) may not neces-
sarily be interdependent or directly related. At any given moment, the portfolio repre-
sents a view of its selected components that both reflect and affect the strategic goals
of the organization— that is, the portfolio represents the organization’s set of active
programs, projects, subportfolios, and other work at a specific point in time.
It is important to understand the relationship of a portfolio and the components
of the portfolio. Figure 1-1 illustrates this relationship.

Figure 1-1. Portfolio Relationships—Example

A portfolio reflects investments made or planned by an organization, which are
aligned with the organization’s strategic goals and objectives. It is where priorities are
identified, investment decisions are made, and resources are allocated. If a portfolio’s
components are not aligned to its organizational strategy, the organization can reason-
ably question why the work is being undertaken.
All components of a portfolio exhibit certain common features:
● They represent investments made or planned by the organization
● They are aligned with the organization’s strategic goals and objectives
● They typically have some distinguishing features that permit the organization to
group them for more effective management
● The components of a portfolio are quantifiable; that is, they can be measured,
ranked and prioritized.

Conversely, the components of a portfolio are differentiated as identified in Table 1-1:

1.3 What Is Portfolio Management?

Portfolio management is the centralized management of one or more portfolios, which
includes identifying, prioritizing, authorizing, managing, and controlling projects, pro-
grams, and other related work, to achieve specific strategic business objectives. There
are many types and varieties of portfolio management. This standard does not attempt
to address all types of portfolio management; instead, it focuses on ‘‘project portfolio
management.’’ Since project portfolio management is the focus of this standard, it is
denoted throughout this document as simply ‘‘portfolio management.’’
Portfolio management is an approach to achieving strategic goals by selecting,
prioritizing, assessing, and managing projects, programs and other related work based
upon their alignment and contribution to the organization’s strategies and objectives.
Portfolio management combines (a) the organization’s focus of ensuring that projects
selected for investment meet the portfolio strategy with (b) the project management
focus of delivering projects effectively and within their planned contribution to the
portfolio.

Table 1-1. Comparative Overview of Project, Program, and Portfolio Management

1.4 The Link With Organizational Strategy

Figure 1-2 shows the general relationships among the strategic and tactical processes
in the organization. From the vision and mission, the organizational strategy and
objectives are developed. Execution of the strategy requires the application of strategic
management processes, systems, and tools to define and develop:
● High-level operations planning and management
● Portfolio planning and management.

This leads to tactical implementation of operational and project-related activities.
The top of the triangle (‘‘Vision,’’ ‘‘Mission,’’ and ‘‘Organizational Strategy and
Objectives’’) illustrates the components used to set the targets or goals. These compo-
nents direct all further organizational actions. Please note the arrows in Figure 1-2
provide the general context of influencing relationships among the elements.
The middle of the triangle (‘‘High-level Operations Planning and Management’’
and ‘‘Project Portfolio Planning and Management’’) represents the processes that
establish appropriate actions required to meet the goals. These processes interact with
the bottom of the triangle, in which the contribution of all operational activities must
be compared to ongoing value creation, and the contribution of all project activities
must be compared to the creation of new value.
‘‘Management of On-going Operations’’ and ‘‘Management of Authorized Programs
and Projects,’’ which appear at the bottom of the triangle, correspond to those compo-
nents that ensure the organization’s operations and portfolios are executed effectively
and efficiently.
Both the operational and project aspects of an organization must be considered in
portfolio management. The operational side of the organization uses recurrent activi-
ties and operations management processes that facilitate effective high level planning

Figure 1-2. An Organizational Context of Portfolio Management

and management. The project side of the organization uses program/project manage-
ment processes that enable efficient project planning and implementation activities.
At the tactical management level, the question is: ‘‘Is this operation or project managed
efficiently with optimal results, from an optimum use of resources, with optimum
effort, and complying with organizational values and standards?’’
Organizations rely on projects and programs in order to achieve their strategic
intent. The application of portfolio management allows this interconnection by the
sharing of goals and the allocation of resources. The flow of control is as follows:

1. Strategic intent and prioritization provide direction for determining the financial
resources that should be allocated to the portfolio.
2. The strategic intent is mapped onto a set of portfolio components (i.e., projects and
programs), including their resource allocations. These components are managed
according to the portfolio management principles outlined in this standard.
3. Each program corresponds to the delegated subset of the overall strategic intent,
which it will deliver by means of the allocated resources.
4. Each project is defined by its contribution to the portfolio’s strategic intent, and
can then be managed according to the principles in the PMBOK威 Guide and other
principles as appropriate.

1.5 The Link Between Portfolio Management and Organizational
Governance

Portfolio management is one of several governance methods used within organizations.
Governance is the act of creating and using a framework to align, organize, and execute
activities in a collectively coherent and intelligible manner in order to meet goals.
Organizational governance establishes the limits of power, rules of conduct, and proto-
cols of work that organizations can use effectively to advance strategic goals and
objectives and to realize anticipated benefits.
Organizational governance occurs at different decision-making levels of the organi-
zation in support of specific goals and objectives. These goals and objectives are
defined through the organization’s strategic planning process. This process defines
the means of attaining the goals through either operations (ongoing organizational
activities) or temporary endeavors (projects), and also defines how they are governed.
Whether managing operations or managing projects, all governance levels are linked
together to ensure that each organizational action is ultimately aligned with organiza-
tional strategy. Figure 1-3 illustrates this relationship:

Figure 1-3. Governance Context

04-04-06 12:56:34

Organizational governance involves controls—such as phase gates, meetings, metrics
to monitor progress, etc.—and includes the domains of portfolio, program, and project
management. The portfolio management domain of governance is the subject of this
standard, and its processes are explained in Chapter 3, Portfolio Management Pro-
cesses.
There are many corresponding roles and responsibilities among governance entities
concerning portfolio management. The areas of executive management, portfolio man-
agement, program management, project management, and operations management
all play critical, interrelated roles. Such relationships are shown in Figure 1-4. In smaller
organizations, the roles of the executive management and portfolio management may
be within the same area of responsibilities.

Figure 1-4. Cross-Company Portfolio Management Process Relationships

Figure 1-4 does not show all activities of the four levels, only the relationships to
the different organizational activities.

1.6 The Link Between Portfolio Management and Operations
Management

Portfolio management interacts with and impacts a number of organizational func-
tions. Functional groups can be stakeholders in the portfolio and can also serve as
sponsors of various components. Moreover, an operational budget may be influenced
by portfolio management decisions, including allocation of resources to support port-
folio components.
‘‘Operations’’ is a term used to describe day-to-day organizational activities. This
involves processes that are not necessarily project-specific. However, processes used by
operational management are often outcomes of the execution of portfolio components.
Component outputs or deliverables often result in ongoing work that is required for
the organization to realize the portfolio’s planned benefits. Unless this work is managed
effectively, the expected value in undertaking a particular component will not be

achieved. The portfo lio management process must take into account operational
issues, processes, and results throughout its management cycle.
The following examples illustrate the relationship of operations management to
portfolio management:

1.6.1 Finance

Effective management of the portfolio requires tangible, timely, and accurate financial
information. Financial goals and objectives are considered in the management of a
portfolio; therefore, a finance function will monitor portfolio budgets, compare project
spending with the allocated budget, and examine benefits realized, ensuring that
financial plan adjustments are made and projected savings are taken into account.

1.6.2 Marketing

Market analysis, benchmarking, and research play a significant role in the portfolio
management process. An organization’s portfolio components are driven by such
considerations as market opportunity, platform development, support functions, regu-
latory obligations, or operational requirements. Input from the marketing function is
required for some of the strategic decisions that dictate criteria to be used in selecting
and managing components. For a nonprofit organization, a similar analysis of value-
for-money or value to organizational vision will be needed for component selection
and management.

1.6.3 Corporate Communications

Since portfolio management provides key capabilities for achievement of an organiza-
tion’s strategy, there may be a major focus at the executive level both to assemble
and to communicate detailed information on the progress of major objectives and
impacts of the components, as well as any changes to previously communicated
plans. Ongoing and well-targeted communication is a key requirement for maintaining
stakeholder confidence in and support for the objectives to be achieved and the
approaches being implemented. In addition, in order to ensure coordination and
effective teamwork, communication among the teams responsible for the various
components need to planned, formalized, and managed in concert with best practices
(for example, as defined in the corresponding PMBOK威 Guide knowledge areas).
Various portfolio events or milestones need to be communicated both inside and
outside the organization. This could include achievement of a major objective, elimina-
tion of a component, and other matters requiring corporate communications.

1.6.4 Human Resource Management

By looking at the portfolio of components, enterprise resource planning can identify
the skills and qualifications needed for success. Skilled resources will then become
available ‘‘in the pool’’ for placement into programs or projects or for related work.
The function responsible for human resource management also needs to address
organizational and resource impacts of major changes resulting from portfolio compo-
nents.

1.7 The Links Between Portfolio Management and Program and
Project Management

Program and project management each measure actual-to-planned schedule, effort,
and budget for individual components to anticipate potential problems and to ensure
corrective action is occurring, and reports this analysis to portfolio management. This
information is used in portfolio reviews to determine required actions. Program and
project management may work together with portfolio management to determine
‘‘go/no go’’ criteria for proposed and current components, including ‘‘termination
criteria’’ (phase gates). Program and project management may work together with
portfolio management in capacity planning by inputting resource requirements (e.g.,
human resources, financial, and physical assets).
Portfolios rely on projects (either standalone or within programs) in order to achieve
their strategic intent. For this reason, they are all interconnected by the sharing and
allocation of goals and resources.
Regularly scheduled reviews and planned, continuous communication among proj-
ect management, program management, or portfolio management ensures that the
appropriate resources are allocated to their assigned, authorized portfolio components.

1.8 Role of the Portfolio Manager

The portfolio manager, typically a senior manager or senior management team, is
responsible for monitoring and managing assigned portfolios in the following ways:
● Playing a key role in project prioritization, making sure there is a balance of compo-
nents, and that the components align with strategic goals
● Providing key stakeholders with timely assessment of portfolio and component
performance, as well as early identification of (and intervention into) portfolio-level
issues and risks that are impacting performance
● Measuring the value to the organization through investment instruments, such as
return on investment (ROI), net present value (NPV), payback period (PP), meeting
Congressional or legislative mandates, achieving the educational needs of current
or future students, etc.
● Ensuring timely and consistent communication to the stakeholders on progress,
impacts, and changes associated with the management of the portfolio, in order to
maintain stakeholder understanding and support of the objectives and approach
● Participating in program and project reviews to reflect senior level support, leader-
ship, and involvement in important matters.
In order to succeed in this role, the portfolio manager should apply expertise in all
of the following areas (with the support of a program/project management office,
as needed):

1.8.1 Benefits Realization

Both fiscal and non-fiscal benefits to the organization must be understood. Decisions
are made throughout the portfolio management organizational process to optimize
the overall contribution of the components to the organization. To optimize benefits
realization, a portfolio manager must have a good understanding of the organization’s
vision, mission, and strategy to aid in optimization of the portfolio. A portfolio manager
must understand how to relate the strategic goals, objectives, and priorities with the
portfolio component plans to achieve the organization’s goals.

04-04-06 12:56:34

1.8.2 Program and Project Management Methods and Techniques

The portfolio manager must have an understanding of project and program manage-
ment. Furthermore, a portfolio manager must be able to understand not only high-
level project management reporting to determine the health of a project, but also its
details to determine whether management approaches are lacking or failing.

1.8.3 Process Development and Continuous Improvement

The po r t fo l io manage r mus t unde r s tand p ro ce ss deve lopmen t and con t inuous
improvement to develop the most suitable portfolio management process. The portfo-
lio manager, together with other organizational leaders, will have the ability to develop
a sound, structured, and well thought-out portfolio management process that best
suits the organization and coordinates well with other processes.

1.8.4 General Management Skills

An effective portfolio manager has good leadership and management skills (e.g., com-
munication skills, team building skills, etc.) and is able to interact with senior manage-
ment. Furthermore, the portfolio manager should have knowledge of relevant markets,
customer base, standards, and the regulatory environment. A portfolio manager should
also have analytical skills to monitor the portfolio based on portfolio performance
reports and metrics.

1.9 Portfolio Management Metrics

The metrics of portfolio management typically include aggregate measures of strategic
goal achievement, financial contribution, asset maintenance and development, end-
user satisfaction, stakeholder satisfaction, risk profile, and resource capability. Metrics
describe the availability and type of resources needed to support the portfolio compo-
nents as planned and during execution. Metrics describe progress toward established
targets, such as financial and milestone achievements and fulfillment of deliverables.
Financial measures, for example, may include aggregate return on investment (ROI),
net present value (NPV), and distribution of financial support as part of the strategic
goals. Milestone measures could include such indicators as budget vs. actual costs,
customer satisfaction scores, product release performance, or other organization-
specific measure. Metrics describe the value and benefit realization of the portfolio
as a whole, as interpreted by the organization. As appropriate, metrics may be made
available for individual programs or projects of special interest from a portfolio man-
agement perspective.

1.10 Portfolio Management Reporting

Reporting in the portfolio management context refers to several possible forms of
measurement pertaining to portfolio content and performance. Such reporting is
tightly linked with other types of reporting within the organization that will influence
decisions regarding priority, balancing, direction, etc., of the portfolio. Portfolio report-
ing ensures that there is effective communication between the project managers,
portfolio manager, portfolio sponsor, and portfolio stakeholders. The following are
common forms of portfolio reporting:

89513$$CH1

04-04-06 12:56:34

1.10.1 Program/Project Reporting

Many organizations place the responsibility for reporting the effectiveness of a program
or project within a program or project management office (PMO). Among other things,
the PMO can provide summaries, as well as details of the total investment made in a
component, to serve as an input for measuring the component’s value. Regardless of
the reporting mechanism, component values can be measured in several ways, such as:
● Enterprise Strategic Goal Achievement—Reporting the extent to which components
will or have contributed to organization strategic goals
● Enterprise Asset Maintenance and Development—Reporting the extent to which
components will or have contributed to the maintenance and development of
particular organization assets
● Enterprise Risk Profile—Reporting component risk for the organization
● Enterprise Resource Capability—Reporting planned and actual resource usage by
components for the organization.

Other forms of measurement may be needed as well, and can be specific to the
organization or the portfolio. For example, reporting on key issues such as safety,
environmental compliance, staffing issues, etc., may also be necessary.

1.10.2 Financial Reporting

Financial data and perceived value are important criteria used in selecting components
that will be included in the portfolio. They may be key indicators that determine the
balance and content of the portfolio.

Chapter 2

Portfolio Management Process
and Organization

Portfolio management is a process that helps and engages executive management
in meeting organizational needs and expectations. Portfolio management enhances
transparent and efficient decision-making concerning projects, either directly or under
programs. Portfolio management is carried out in an environment broader than the
portfolio itself, through its roles and processes that relate across the organization. This
chapter describes the key components of the portfolio management context in the
following sections:
2.1 Portfolio Management Process Overview
2.2 Portfolio Stakeholder Roles and Responsibilities
2.3 Organizational Influences

2.1 Portfolio Management Process Overview

2.1.1 Links with Strategy

Portfolio management includes processes to collect, identify, categorize, evaluate,
select, prioritize, balance, authorize, and review components within the portfolio to
evaluate how well they are performing in relation to the key indicators and the strategic
plan. During a typical business cycle, components will be reviewed and validated in
relation to the following:
● Alignment of the components with corporate strategy
● Viability of the components as part of the portfolio, based on key indicators
● Value and relationship to other portfolio components
● Available resources and portfolio priorities
● Additions and deletions of portfolio components.

The organization’s overall strategy is determined at the executive level and drives
the definitions of the strategic goals and objectives. These goals are passed to the
portfolio management function to ensure that components are aligned to achieve the
organization’s goals. Based on this, portfolio management will select, prioritize, and
approve proposed portfolio components. Portfolio management must also review the

15

89513$$CH2

portfolio for balance (short-term versus long-term return, risk to benefit) and negotiate
agreement(s) with relevant strategic stakeholders (e.g., executive management, opera-
tions and/or program management).
Once a portfolio component is authorized, it becomes the responsibility of the
program/project management to take control of the component and apply the correct
management processes to ensure that the work is done effectively and efficiently. The
responsible project/program managers will monitor planned-to-actual performance
(relating to time, budget, resources, quality, and scope) and will communicate consoli-
dated information to the portfolio management. Portfolio management should estab-
lish criteria for determining governance actions, such as deciding when projects/
programs should be terminated or suspended prior to originally planned comple-
tion dates.
Portfolio management also requires updates from the strategic planning process
regarding strategic changes, to ensure that components no longer related to the current
goals are discontinued. For example, if strategic planning determines that a goal is
no longer valid for the organization, portfolio management should review the portfolio
and report on any components that are in place to achieve a now obsolete goal.
In addition, portfolio management must report portfolio performance as it relates
to achieving the organization’s planned strategy.

2.1.2 Portfolio Management Process Cycle

Portfolio management is a continuous business process with certain activities invoked
during a given year when deemed appropriate by the organization. Selection and
authorization of components, for example, can be part of annual planning, or strategic
refreshing, with quarterly or semi-annual updates. Performance monitoring of the
portfolio is usually continuous. Revising the portfolio mix may be required when
disruptions to the organization occur. Once established, the portfolio management
process does not end—except when the organization chooses to abandon the portfolio
management approach, or the organization ceases to exist.

2.2 Portfolio Stakeholder Roles and Responsibilities

Portfolio stakeholders are individuals and organizations that are actively involved with
the portfolio, or those whose interests may be positively or negatively affected because
of portfolio management. They may also exert influence over the portfolio, its compo-
nents, processes, and decisions. The levels of involvement by stakeholders may vary
from organization to organization or from portfolio to portfolio within an organization.
The roles and responsibilities of stakeholders are described in the following sections.

2.2.1 Executive Managers

Executive managers convey the strategic goals to portfolio management. Portfolio
management must be able to report to executive management on the achievement of
the goals through the performance of the portfolio. In smaller organizations, executive
management may assume all or some of the portfolio management responsibilities,
including making review board decisions.

2.2.2 Portfolio Review Board

A Portfolio Review Board, when used, dictates the framework, rules, and procedures
for making portfolio decisions. The board is comprised of those individuals with the
requisite knowledge and experience to discern the degree of alignment of strategy
and organizational goals with portfolio components. The board is granted the authority
to evaluate the portfolio performance and to make important decisions when needed
or requested.

2.2.3 Portfolio Managers

Portfolio managers or portfolio management teams, are responsible for the portfolio
management process. The portfolio manager will receive component performance
information and convey to the Portfolio Review Board how the components as a whole
are aligned with the strategic goals.

2.2.4 Sponsors

Sponsors champion the funding approval of their components (projects, programs,
portfolios, and other work). To ensure approval, a sponsor must aid in supplying a
viable business case to the Portfolio Review Board or other oversight team. Once the
component is approved, the sponsor must help ensure that it performs according to
plan and achieves its strategic goals.

2.2.5 Program Managers

Program managers work closely with the sponsors to gain funding approval for their
programs. To ensure this, a program manager must aid in supplying a good business
case to the portfolio management process. The program manager must help ensure
that the components in his or her program perform according to plan and achieve
the strategic goals associated with the program.

2.2.6 Project Managers

Project managers are responsible for the effective planning, execution, tracking, and
delivery of the projects that are assigned to them, in line with the corresponding
objectives and specifications. Project managers provide project performance indica-
tors, directly or indirectly, to the Portfolio Review Board. This information will be used
with other criteria to determine which projects will be continued.
The project manager may also supply a recovery plan for projects in jeopardy. The
project manager will be responsible for the budget and schedule of his/her projects.
Additionally, the project manager’s peer group of other project managers is a stake-
holder group in the portfolio management process. Both the project manager and
portfolio management will benefit from formal or informal networks of project manag-
ers in the organization. These networks can help to facilitate a balanced distribution
of scarce resources through improved communication and sharing of best practices.

to-day operations of the portfolio system to actually being responsible for the resourc-
ing and direct management of a component or category of components.

2.2.8 Project Team

Project teams are responsible for completing the component deliverables as planned.
A project team will focus on its particular project to ensure the project continues to
successful completion.

2.2.9 Operations Management

Operations management is responsible for the ongoing business operations.

2.2.10 Functional Managers

Functional managers ensure that the proper resources are allocated to the portfolio
components, and that those resources are performing in accordance with plans.
Functional managers are also responsible for ensuring that the skills and capabilities
of their staff are kept current and aligned to the long term as well as the immediate
needs of the organization. Functional managers may provide technical backup and
coaching as appropriate to their staff.

2.2.11 Finance Managers

Finance managers perform financial analysis on components, review portfolio budget
performance and make recommendations to the appropriate oversight entity. They
also provide management information needed by program and project managers to
assess variances and develop status reports.

2.2.12 Customers

Customers, both internal and external, benefit from successful implementation and
delivery of portfolio components. Customer satisfaction may be one of the strategic
objectives that determine the mix and priority of the components within the portfolio.

2.2.13 Vendors/Business Partners

Business partners and vendors are also key stakeholders in managing the project
portfolio. Most of the time, organizations involve their business partners and/or ven-
dors in executing various programs/projects. Hence it is very important to involve
them, to the extent needed, in the overall Portfolio Management Process.

2.3 Organizational Influences

Successful portfolio management means that all management levels must effectively
support the effort and communicate clearly and consistently the value of portfolio
management to the organization.
When making allocation decisions, organizations are driven by a variety of con-
straints and dynamics brought to bear by the stakeholders. Balancing stakeholders’
interests, both short-term and long term, while staying aligned with strategic goals,

is the essence of portfolio management. Decisions need to be made in the best interest
of the overall portfolio performance regardless of the impact to individual components.
The forces influencing portfolio management are identified in the following sections.

2.3.1 Organizational Culture

The organization as a whole must understand the business need for portfolio manage-
ment and commit the people, processes, and tools to make it successful.
Lack of organizational support for the concept and approach of portfolio manage-
ment will be a major obstacle to portfolio management success—success that will be
directly affected by the level of maturity in the organization.
Another important element is the organization’s ability to accept and implement
the changes implied by the portfolio. A major obstacle to achieving the full level of
improvement expected from the portfolio could be not recognizing and formalizing
the organization’s ability to handle change. Each component of the portfolio should
consistently apply similar techniques to facilitate and handle organizational change.

2.3.2 Economic Impact

Financial conditions may place a premium on or an increased opportunity for portfolio
management to assist in decision-making with regard to failing projects or succeeding
projects, negative or positive cash flow, time to market, and resource balancing, in
order to ensure that a higher percentage of projects will be successful.

2.3.3 Organizational Impacts

Effective portfolio management can have positive impacts across the organization by
facilitating local planning in alignment with strategic goals. Lack of efficient and
effective processes and procedures in other functional areas of the organization can
have a considerable impact on portfolio management. The portfolio manager will have
to factor this into the corresponding plans and decisions.

Chapter 3

Portfolio Management Processes

Portfolio management is accomplished through processes, using relevant knowledge,
skills, tools, and techniques that receive inputs and generate outputs.
In order to be successful, the portfolio management team must:
● Understand the organization’s strategic plan.
● Establish determining factors for managing the portfolio based on the strategic
plan. These determining factors will support the beginning of the portfolio process.
● Consider all of the organization’s projects, programs, and other portfolio compo-
nents.
● Follow agreed-upon processes.

This standard documents the processes needed to make decisions about compo-
nents, and identifies those portfolio management processes that have been recognized
as generally accepted practices for most project portfolios most of the time. These
processes apply globally and across industry groups . General ly accepted practice
means there is general agreement that the application of these portfolio management
processes enhances the probability of success over time.
This does not mean that the processes described should always be applied uniformly
for all portfolios. The portfolio management team is always responsible for determining
what process is appropriate—and the appropriate degree of rigor for each process—
for any given portfolio.
Portfolio managers and their teams are advised to consider addressing each process
and its constituent inputs and outputs. Portfolio managers and their teams should
use this chapter as a high-level guide for those processes that they must consider in
managing a portfolio.
Portfolio management is a business process that requires each of the portfolio
processes to be interrelated in a continuous sequence to facilitate final decision-
making and portfolio balancing.
This standard presents and describes the required elements for portfolio manage-
ment. However, it does not intend to explain how to implement and utilize portfolio
management in an organization where none exists. This standard presumes that the
organization has a strategic plan, along with customary mission and vision statements,
as well as strategic goals and objectives. When reading this standard, the reader must
assume that in order to implement the portfolio processes presented here, the following
conditions exist:

● The organization— including management—embraces the theory of portfolio man-
agement
● A number of projects and programs exist
● Appropriately skilled staff are available to manage the portfolio
● Project management processes exist
● The organizational roles and responsibilities are defined
● A communication plan has been developed to communicate business decisions
throughout the organization.

3.1 Portfolio Management Process Groups

This standard describes portfolio management processes in terms of integration, inter-
actions between them, and the purposes they serve. These processes aggregate into
two groups, known as the Portfolio Management Process Groups:
● Aligning Process Group—This group determines how components will be catego-
rized, evaluated and selected for inclusion, and managed in the portfolio.
● Monitoring and Controlling Process Group—This group reviews performance indi-
cators periodically for alignment with strategic objectives.

These groups have clear dependencies and are performed in the management of
each portfolio. They are independent of application area or industry focus. Group and
individual constituent processes are often iterated during the portfolio management
process. Constituent processes also can interact, both within their particular Process
Group and with the other Portfolio Management Process Group. Remember that the
portfolio management process is ongoing and updated from time to time at the
discretion of the organization. The Aligning Process Group depends on subprocesses
within the business process cycle’s planning and authorizing phase. Similarly, the
Monitoring and Controlling Process Group entails subprocesses within the business
process cycle’s monitoring and controlling phase. This relationship ensures a tight
linkage of the portfolio management processes within the overall ongoing business
process cycle.
The Aligning Process Group ensures the availability of current information regarding
strategic goals that the portfolio is to support, as well as current operational rules for
evaluating components and managing the portfolio. In addition, this Process Group
establishes a structured, agreed-upon method for keeping the mix of portfolio compo-
nents aligned to the organizational strategy.
The Aligning Process Group is most active at the time the organization refreshes
its strategic goals and lays out near-term budgets and plans for the organization.
Traditionally, these activities take place at the annual budgeting time, although some
organizations have refresh cycles that are more frequent. Such activities may be sched-
uled quarterly, for example, or may occur because of changes in the business climate.
The Monitoring and Controlling Process Group is concerned with the activities
necessary to ensure that the portfolio as a whole is performing to predefined metrics
determined by the organization. These metrics, such as total return on investment or
net present value thresholds, may be monitored by category and aggregate perfor-
mance. In some instances, individual components of the portfolio may be tracked.
Figure 3-1 illustrates an overview of the Portfolio Management Process Groups.

The diagram illustrates:
● The organization’s strategic plan. It is the decision base for any project portfolio
management processes and the basis on which to establish the determining factors
that will make each portfolio unique.
● The portfolio management processes. These are a series of interrelated processes,
from identifying and authorizing portfolio components to reviewing the progress
of each individual component, as well as that of the entire portfolio.

Sections 3.2.1 and 3.2.2 describe individual processes highlighted in Figure 3-2 by
Process Group. Each process is described in terms of its basic activity along with
inputs and outputs. [Related tools and techniques appear in Appendix D.]

3.2.1 Aligning Process Group

3.2.1.1 Identification
The purpose of this process is to create an up-to-date list, with sufficient information,
of ongoing and new components that will be managed through portfolio management.
Key activities within this process include:
● Comparing ongoing components and new component proposals with a predeter-
mined component definition and related key descriptors
● Rejecting components that do not fit within the predetermined definition
● Classifying identified components into predefined classes of components, such as
project, program, portfolio, and other works.

3.2.1.1.1 Identification: Inputs

.1 Strategic Plan
Strategic plans are used by an organization to align its organization and budget
structure with organizational priorities, missions, and objectives. A strategic
plan typically includes a vision and a mission statement, a description of the

Table 3-1: Identification: Inputs and Outputs

03-29-06 14:07:10

organization’s long-term goals, objectives, and means by which the organization
plans to use to achieve these general goals and objectives. The strategic plan
may also identify external factors that could affect achievement of long-term
goals. Strategic planning is a process used by an organization to anticipate and
adapt to expected changes. Operational plans are developed by management
to support the annual or ongoing operations of the organization. These plans
may be loosely or tightly integrated with the organization’s strategic plan.

.2 Component Definition
The component definition is based on the strategic and/or operational plan’s
goals and objectives. The component definition will be useful to make a first
screening on the list of components. For example, to be part of the portfolio, a
component should be greater than a predetermined minimum size and be in
line with the basic strategic objectives.

.3 Component Key Descriptors and Templates
The component key descriptors are used for categorizing, evaluating, and select-
ing components through the portfolio management process. Each descriptor
is defined and the corresponding acceptance levels are predetermined. Key
descriptors may include, but are not limited to:
● Component number
● Component description
● Class of component
䡩 Project
䡩 Program
䡩 Business case
䡩 Subportfolio
䡩 Other work.
● High-level plan
● Strategic objectives supported
● Quantitative benefits
䡩 New revenues
䡩 Cost reduction
䡩 Return on investment
䡩 Internal rate of return
䡩 Net present value
䡩 Reduced cycle time
䡩 Quality improvement.
● Qualitative benefits
䡩 Strategic alignment
䡩 Risk reduction
䡩 Legislative requirements
䡩 Platform development
䡩 Business opportunity.
● Component customer
● Component sponsor
● Key stakeholders
● Resources required
● Timescale
● Project dependencies
● Key deliverables

● Budget estimates
● Business unit
● Market risk level estimates
● Market definition and impact.

.4 Inventory of All Existing Components
The inventory of all ongoing components is a list of components that have been
authorized previously and are being executed through the project or program
management process, or that have been put on a waiting list at the end of the
previous portfolio cycle.

.5 Inventory of All New Component Proposals
The inventory of all new component proposals is a list of components that have
been proposed since the previous portfolio cycle.

3.2.1.1.2 Identification: Outputs
.1 List of Components
The list of components comprises all the qualifying components meeting the
definition, complete with appropriate documentation. This may include a list
of relationships between various components.

.2 Key Descriptors for Each Component
The key descriptors for each component represent the complete documentation
for each qualifying component presented on proper templates.

.3 List of Rejected Components
The list of rejected components comprises all components that do not meet the
component definition or that are not correctly and completely documented.
These component proposals may be eliminated, rewritten, or regrouped to be
resubmitted to the portfolio (or to another) process.

3.2.1.2 Categorization
The purpose of this process is to group identified components into relevant business
groups to which a common set of decision filters and criteria can be applied for
evaluation, selection, prioritization, and balancing. The categories are defined on the
basis of the strategic plan. The components in a given group have a common goal
and can be measured on the same basis, regardless of their origin in the organization.
The categorization of the components allows the organization to balance its investment
and its risks between all strategic categories and strategic goals.
Key activities within this process include:
● Identifying strategic categories based on the strategic plan
● Comparing identified components to the categorization criteria
● Grouping each component into only one category.

.3 Categories from Strategic Plan
The categories are based on the strategic plan. They are used to group and
compare components having a common strategic goal and common measure-
ment criteria. The organization execut ives and portfol io management team
establish the categories jointly. The categories need to be defined and widely
understood throughout the organization. The categories may change or evolve
if the strategic plan changes or evolves. A category may include components
originating from various departments or business units of the organization. The
number of categories is usually limited and may include:
● Increased profitability (revenue increase, cost reduction, etc.)
● Risk reduction
● Efficiency improvement
● Legal obligation
● Market share increase
● Process improvement
● Continuous improvement
● Business imperatives (e.g. internal toolkit, IT compatibility or upgrades).

Each category may also include subcategories to generate comparative tables,
graphs, or charts such as:
● Size (e.g., effort, budget)
● Duration
● Component type (e.g., projects, programs, other work)
● Phase.

3.2.1.2.2 Categorization: Outputs
.1 List of Categorized Components
The result is a list of components grouped by category, comprising all identified
components divided within all the strategic categories. When a component
cannot be categorized, it is up to the portfolio management group to decide
whether they keep it on the list for further evaluation and selection.

3.2.1.3 Evaluation
This is the process for gathering all pertinent information to evaluate components,
with the purpose of comparing them in order to facilitate the selection process. Infor-
mation is gathered and summarized for each component of the portfolio. The informa-
tion can be qualitative or quantitative, and comes from a variety of sources across the
organization. The data collection is iterated several times, until reaching the required
level of accuracy. Graphs, charts, documents, and recommendations are produced to
support the subsequent selection process.
Key activities within this process include:
● Evaluating components with a scoring model comprising weighted key criteria
● Producing graphical representations to facilitate decision-making in the selection
process
● Making recommendations for the selection process.

A total value score is calculated with the scoring model for each component.

.3 Graphical Representations
A number of graphical representations (e.g., scoring matrices and bubble charts)
are produced to support decision-making

.4 Evaluation Process Recommendations
Recommendations are made at the end of the evaluation process. The recom-
mendations can be made for a component, a category, or the entire portfolio,
based on the value of each component or a group of components.

3.2.1.4 Selection
This is the process necessary to produce a short list of components based on the
evaluation process recommendations and the organization’s selection criteria. The
evaluation determines the value of each component and produces a list of components
that are ready for prioritization.
Key activities within this process include selecting components based on the evalua-
tion results and comparison to selection criteria. This process will produce a list of
components for prioritization.

.2 Recommendations
Recommendations are made at the end of the selection process. The recommen-
dations can be made for a component, a category, or the entire portfolio. These
recommendations can include prioritization, component segmentation, accep-
tance, or rejection of a component.

3.2.1.5 Prioritization
The purpose of this process is to rank components within each strategic or funding
category (e.g., innovation, cost savings, growth, maintenance, and operations), invest-
ment time frame (e.g., short, medium, and long-term), risk versus return profile, and
organizational focus (e.g., customer, supplier, and internal) according to established
criteria. This step ranks the components to support subsequent analysis required to
validate and balance the portfolio.
Key activities within this process include:
● Confirming the classification of components in accordance with predetermined
strategic categories
● Assigning scoring or weighting criteria for ranking components
● Determining which components should receive highest priority within the portfolio.

documentation.

3.2.1.6 Portfolio Balancing
The purpose of this process is to develop the portfolio component mix with the greatest
potential, to collectively support the organization’s strategic initiatives and achieve
strategic objectives. Portfolio balancing supports the primary benefits of portfolio
management— the ability to plan and allocate resources (i.e., financial, physical assets,
and human resources) according to strategic direction, and the ability to maximize
portfolio return within the organization’s predefined desired risk profile.
Balancing of activities involves reviewing selected and prioritized portfolio compo-
nents. The portfolio is then balanced to support established strategic objectives using
predefined portfolio management criteria, the organization’s desired risk profile, port-
folio performance metrics, and capacity constraints. A recommendation for either
maintaining the portfolio ‘‘as is’’ or adjusting the portfolio is issued at completion of
the balancing activities. In essence, this process includes:
● Adding new components that have been selected and prioritized for authorization
● Identifying components that are not authorized based on the review process
● Eliminating components to be suspended, reprioritized, or terminated based on
the review process.

The selection of the mix of components in order for the portfolio to achieve a desired
return (whi le st il l complying with the estab lished portfo lio management criteria)
should also take into account similarities and synergies that exist between components.
This could include dependency relationships with existing portfo lio components.
Enhancing these interconnections fully leverages all aspects of the portfolio to generate
the greatest return with a minimum of investment.

and rev iew process wou ld return to portfo l io ba lanc ing to ensure tha t any
changes to the portfolio increase support of—and improve the probability of
achieving—strategic goals and objectives.

on the master list.

3.2.1.7 Authorization
The purpose of this process is to formally allocate financial and human resources
required to either develop business cases or execute selected components and to
formally communicate portfolio-balancing decisions.
Activities within this process include:
● Communicating portfolio balancing decisions to key stakeholders, both for compo-
nents included and those not included in the portfolio
● Authorizing selected components and inactivating or terminating components of
the portfolio

Decisions to either remove components from the portfolio, or not include spe-
cific components within, are documented with the rationale for the decisions.

.6 Portfolio Milestones
The list of key deliverables and decision points for all components is consolidated
to show the outcomes expected by the portfolio over time.

3.2.2.1 Portfolio Reporting and Review
The purpose of this process is to gather performance indicators, provide reporting on
them, and review the portfolio at an appropriate predetermined frequency, to ensure
both alignment with the organizational strategy and effective resource utilization. The
review cycle examines all components and is executed on a timeline that is specified
by the organization. Each cycle may contain several reviews with a different focus and
depth of analysis applied in each. The key performance indicators also vary for each
since the purpose of each review varies. Figure 3-3 illustrates the relationships between
strategic planning, portfolio management, operations, and project/program manage-
ment, along with the flow of reporting data.
Ultimately, the purpose of the reviews is to ensure that the portfolio contains
only components that support achievement of the strategic goals. To ensure this,
components must be added, reprioritized, or excluded, based on their performance
and ongoing alignment with the defined strategy in order to ensure effective manage-
ment of the portfolio.

Figure 3-3. Reporting & Review Process Summary

Activities in this process include:
● Reviewing component sponsorship, accountability, and other ownership criteria
against organizational governance standards
● Reviewing component priority, dependencies, scope, expected return, risks, and
financial performance against portfolio control criteria and organizational perceived
value and investment criteria
● Reviewing expected impact of business forecasts, resource utilization, and capacity
constraints on portfolio performance
● Determining whether to continue with, add to, or terminate specific components;
or to reprioritize and realign them with strategic goals
● Making recommendations and/or providing direction to component management
● Proposing changes to how the portfolio is managed (as needed).

Table 3-8: Portfolio Reporting and Review: Inputs and Outputs

3.2.2.1.1 Portfolio Reporting and Review: Inputs
.1 Component Data
Data related to the components are updated regularly during their life cycles,
and provided to management for assessment. The information includes, but is
not limited to: progress against plan, budget, expected return, priority, etc.

.2 Resource Allocation and Capacity Data
Resou rces in th is con text inc lude , fo r examp le , f inanc ia l capac i ty , human
resources, and production capacity. Capacity for all resource classes is examined
so that managers can make prioritization and allocation decisions when selecting
and evaluating components.

.3 Environmental Constraints
External constraints are imposed as either a directive or an influence beyond
the control of the organization. Portfolio managers generally have no control
over environmental constraints, and have limited influence at best. Examples
of environmental constraints include government regulations, interest rates,
and seasonal weather.

.4 Organizational Governance Standards, Controls, and Constraints
Governance standards are the organizational rules applied to managing portfo-
lios and making decisions, such as human resource policies or the organization’s
strategy. Controls are checkpoints in the normal course of business, such as
financial controls or the budgeting and allocation process. Constraints may
include the organizational structure. Portfolio managers generally cannot control
organizational constraints, but they may be able to exert influence upon them.

.5 Evaluation and Selection Criteria
Portfolio reviews use the evaluation and selection criteria to determine whether
a particular component should remain part of the portfolio or be replaced by
a component more likely to move the organization toward its goals.

89513$$CH3

03-29-06 14:07:10

.6 Updated Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
KPIs are the metrics used to determine whether a component is progressing as
expected and whether the results are in line with what the organization expected.

.7 Strategic Goals and Strategy
Ultimately, every component should be aligned to the organization’s strategic
goa ls . W i thou t such a l ignmen t , managemen t shou ld ques t ion why sca rce
resources are being allocated and why the component is being funded. Strategy
is so fundamental to constructing the portfolio that any change in strategy will
trigger an ad hoc review to ensure that all components continue to be aligned.
When a major change occurs, such as results from an acquisition or market
reorganization, the organization may also review its selection criteria and priorit-
ies, along with the full set of components.

.8 Portfolio Management Criteria
These are specific objectives, constraints, and/or guidelines for use by the portfo-
lio manager when managing the portfolio. Examples may include: investment
diversification objectives and risk tolerance thresholds.

3.2.2.1.2 Portfolio Reporting and Review: Outputs
.1 Directives Regarding Components
Based on the review, the portfolio management team provides direction to the
owners of the affected components. This may take the form of continuation,
realignment of priorities or dependencies, resource reallocation, suspension, or
termination.

.2 Portfolio Rebalancing Recommendations
The purpose of reviews is to ensure that the organization continues to invest
in only those portfolio components that support stated strategic goals and objec-
tives, and to verify that those investments remain on-track to achieve stated
strategic goals and objectives. Periodically, an output of the review process may
be a recommendation to realign or discontinue funding of existing portfolio
components. When the portfolio management team recommends that portfolio
rebalancing may be necessary, these recommendations are input to the Strategic
Change process. The Strategic Change process then determines if a significant
change in strategy has occurred, or if the recommended portfolio rebalancing
described above is the extent of needed portfolio rebalancing.

.3 Recommendations to Business
Whereas directives to components flow downward in the organization, recom-
mendations to business flow upward. Based on feedback from the components
and insights gained from review, the portfolio management team may recognize
new or altered dynamics that deserve attention from senior leadership. These
recommendations may include changes to the strategic plan, to the component
selection criteria, or to the portfolio review process itself.

.4 Refined Selection Criteria
Selection, evaluat ion, and prior it izat ion criteria change as the organization
evolves, and the portfolio review process is where the effectiveness of these
criteria is evaluated. If the chosen criteria lead to components that do not

89513$$CH3

03-29-06 14:07:10

generate desired outcomes, the organization should refine the component crite-
ria in order to increase the value added due to the portfolio management process.

.5 Updated Key Indicators
As w ith the component se lect ion criteria, the organ izat ion must determine
whether it is using the correct metrics to make decisions. As appropriate, the
portfolio management team must determine whether component results are
being driven by the selected metrics, and apply new or refined measurements
when needed.

.6 Strategic Goal Achievement Reporting
The portfolio management team reports periodically, or as needed, on achieve-
ment of organizational goals by the portfolio.

3.2.2.2 Strategic Change
The purpose of this process is to enable the portfolio management process to respond
to changes in strategy. Small changes to the strategic plan often do not require changes
to the portfolio. However, significant strategy changes often result in a new strategic
direction, thereby impacting the portfolio. A change in strategic direction can impact
component categorization or prioritization and this will require the portfolio to be
rebalanced.

ing the composition and direction of the portfolio may also change. New leadership
may want to adjust strategy according to different goals. Market maturation or
sector focus change may require different financial profit thresholds. When the
need for new criteria becomes evident, the portfolio management team will examine
criteria in the current strategic plan and move ahead with appropriate changes,
usually focusing first on categorization (Section 3.2). If strategic change is not
occurring, then there is default to portfolio balancing (Section 3.6).

Initial Development of The
Standard for Portfolio
Management

B.1 Introduction

Since 1996, project managers and organizations have recognized the standard for one
project: PMI’s A Guide to the Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK威 Guide).
Then in 2003, PMI introduced its first standard for organizations called the Organiza-
tional Project Management Maturity Model (OPM3威).
Early in 2003, recognizing that the project management profession encompasses a
much broader field, including managing multiple projects through programs and
portfolios, PMI’s Standards Program Team (SPT—which includes the PMI Manager
of Standards plus the Member Advisory Group) chartered the development of ‘‘a
standard, or standards,’’ for program management and portfolio management pro-
cesses.
Like the PMBOK威 Guide standard for ‘‘most projects most of the time,’’ the charter
for the PPMS Program was to focus on processes that are generally recognized as good
practice most of the time. Moreover, the new standard or standards were to emulate
the PMBOK威 Guide—Third Edition, specifically excluding knowledge areas as well as
tools and techniques. The new standard or standards, however, were to map content
relationships to processes and Knowledge Areas lined in the PMBOK威 Guide—Third
Edition.

B.2 Preliminary Work

In the summer of 2003, the PPMS Team formed, eventually including 416 PMI volun-
teers representing 36 countries under the leadership of David Ross, Project Manager,
and Paul Shaltry, Deputy Project Manager.
One of the first challenges was the need to establish common agreement on the
key definitions, in this case, ‘‘program,’’ ‘‘program management,’’ ‘‘portfolio,’’ and
‘‘portfolio management.’’ The PMI Standards Manager brought together all of the
active standards teams to achieve consensus on these definitions. The involved team

89513$$CH5

leaders agreed in time for common definitions to be included in the PMBOK威 Guide—
Third Edition and form the foundation for the program and portfolio management
standards.
Next, the PPMS Team looked at whether the two subjects should be combined as
one standard or treated separately. A sub-team was formed to perform a literature
survey and poll the PM community to determine the differences and similarities
between program and portfolio management processes. The research confirmed that
while program management processes provide for the management of a group of
interdependent projects, portfolio management comprises continuous, repeatable,
and sustainable processes designed to map business requirements and objectives to
projects and programs. As a result of this investigation, the PPMS Team concluded
that the profession would be best served with two standards.
Despite the differences in these processes, the PPMS Team believed that because
of the relationships between the two subjects and that these were first time standards,
it would be best to manage them both under one program. The PPMS Core Team
proposed this approach to the SPT, which approved the recommendation. In kind,
the PPMS Team developed detailed requirements for each standard that the SPT also
approved. The Core Team developed a program plan and general team orientation,
which was mandatory, to help volunteers engage effectively. Development of both
standards began in early 2004.

B.3 Drafting The Standard for Portfolio Management

The Portfolio Management Architecture Team (PortMAT), which comprised 13 partici-
pants, led first by Larry Goldsmith and then jointly by Beth Ouellette and Claude
Emond, organized into three sub-teams: Content, Process, and Governance. While
most of the work was done virtually, the team gathered for a breakthrough meeting
in Montreal in July 2004. There, the team was able to focus on the processes of portfolio
management and how they interconnect.
The group had much debate as to whether the proposed standard should include
the introduction of a portfolio management system to an organization or whether it
should focus purely on the ongoing processes of portfolio management. The team
agreed that the proposed processes had to assume that the portfolio had already been
established within the organization.
Between July and September, the PortMAT did a series of team reviews and feedback
sessions to connect the related processes. The team met again in Montreal to put the
finishing touches on the first complete draft prior to handing it off to the Edit and
Quality Teams in late September.
In the last quarter of 2004, the PortMAT’s draft standard underwent separate reviews
by the PPMS Edit and Quality Teams in preparation for a broader review by, potentially,
the whole PPMS Team. This broader review emulated the eventual global exposure
draft review that PMI would conduct. The ‘‘mini-exposure draft’’ process generated
950 comments from PPMS volunteers around the worlds.
The PortMAT’s work benefited from these comments and recommendation in the
improvement or confirmation of content, even though a significant number of com-
ments received were editorial. In general, this internal exposure draft process validated
that the PortMAT’s draft was on target, as reviewers did not identify any major gaps.

B.4 Delivering the First Standard for Portfolio Management

The PPMS Core Team guided the final revisions and submitted the revised version to
the general PPMS Team for a consensus vote. The overwhelming majority of those
voting indicated acceptance of the proposed standard without reservation. The Core
Team approved the proposed standard before turning it over to the SPT for review
and approval in February 2005. The SPT engaged independent subject matter experts
to augment the review process. From there, minor refinements were made and the
proposed standard went on to a 90-day Exposure Draft process starting in May.
The exposure draft period for The Standard for Portfolio Management ended July
9. PMI received 455 comments that the PPMS Adjudication Team reviewed. More than
half of these comments were accepted, accepted with modification, or identified for
review in the next version of the standard. The PPMS Core Team approved the actions
of the Adjudication Team and directed the final edit and approval of the proposed.
Only one adjudication action was appealed, and PMI’s Adjudication Appeals Team
subsequently resolved it.
In October 2005, the PPMS Core Team transferred the final draft for approval by
the PMI Standards Consensus Team and subsequent publication.

Appendix D

Project Portfolio Management
Tools and Techniques

1.0 Introduction

This appendix presents a summary description of the tools and techniques that are
typically used by organizations to manage their project portfolios. It does not contain
an all-inclusive list of tools and techniques used; instead it focuses on the main
requirements of portfolio management and on how they can be addressed.
The typical tools listed and presented are thus illustrated in a generic manner to
indicate their intent and workings, while leaving to the reader the latitude required
to adapt them to a specific situation and the project portfolio management require-
ments of upper management.
Part 2.0 of this appendix discusses the main requirements of portfolio management
and the corresponding characteristics that selection tools and techniques must exhibit
to support the portfo l io management process in h igh l igh t ing and tack l ing these
requirements.
Part 3.0 is a process-by-process presentation of the tools and techniques. Many of
the tools presented are pertinent to more than one process and/or Process Group,
their use and utility being enriched by new available data while the portfolio evolves.
Therefore, some of those tools and techniques will be illustrated more than once to
reflect the new value added by the acquisition of portfolio realization data.

2.0 Overview of Tools and Techniques for Project Portfolio
Management

The main issues of portfolio management are reflected by its two Process Groups,
namely:
● Aligning Process Group. This group identifies what will be managed in the portfolio,
in which categories, as well as how elements will be evaluated and chosen for
inclusion or not in a given portfolio of projects. This group is highlighted in Table 1.
● Monitoring Process Group. This group is involved with reviewing pre-selected
performance indicators periodically to ensure/confirm the alignment of portfolio
components with the organization’s strategic objectives. This group is highlighted
in Table 2.

Table 1. Aligning Process Group (3.2.1)

Table 2. Monitoring & Controlling Process Group (3.2.2)

Subsequently, the first tools and techniques that must be used are those that
can provide to the organization, based on predetermined key selection criteria, the
information required to categorize, evaluate, select, and prioritize and authorize
components.
When all the components of the portfolio are selected, properly aligned with
strategic objectives, prioritized and authorized for realization, some other tools and
techniques are required to ensure the proper monitoring of their evolution, both
as individual components as well as a whole. This is to ensure that the components
are still aligned, that the portfolio and its individual elements are evolving in the
desired direction, and that eventually the benefits anticipated from deploying those
components (projects, programs and others) are still achievable and/or have been
effectively materialized. Such tools and techniques will thus have to provide indica-
tors to permit comparison between expectations, planned objectives, and past,
current, and evolving situations, as well as forecasts and recommendations for
future action.

3.0 Tools and Techniques to use for Each of the Portfolio
Management Subprocesses

What follows is a step-by-step presentation of some typical tools and techniques that
address the issues of portfolio management through each of its processes. Note that
the heading numbers correspond with those in Chapter 3, Portfolio Management
Processes.

3.2.1 Aligning Process Group

3.2.1.1 Identification

Figure 1. Identification Process Tools and Techniques

Tools and techniques for component identification aim at helping the organization
to produce a list of components characterized by a common set of ‘‘key descriptors’’
for further comparison, evaluation, and selection. Some of those key descriptors could
also be used as preliminary ‘‘filters,’’ permitting the acceptance or not of components
for further evaluation and implementation.
As indicated in Chapter 3 of the standard, key descriptors may include, but are not
limited to:
● Component number
● Component description
● Class of component
䡩 Project
䡩 Program
䡩 Business case
䡩 Subportfolio
䡩 Other work.
● High-level plan
● Strategic objectives supported
● Quantitative benefits
䡩 New revenues
䡩 Cost reduction
䡩 Return on investment
䡩 Internal rate of return
䡩 Net present value
䡩 Reduced cycle time
䡩 Quality improvement.
● Qualitative benefits
䡩 Strategic alignment
䡩 Risk reduction
䡩 Legislative requirements
䡩 Platform development
䡩 Business opportunity.
● Component customer
● Component sponsor

● Key stakeholders
● Resources required
● Timescale
● Project dependencies
● Key deliverables
● Budget estimates
● Business unit
● Market risk level estimates
● Market definition and impact.

At this stage of the portfolio management process, available tools and techniques
include, among others:

.1 Documentation of All Inventoried Components Based on Key Descriptors
The documentation of all inventoried components based on key descriptors is
provided by the promoter of the component and is presented to ensure a com-
mon base of comparison. Acceptance levels, if and whenever required to filter/
eliminate components, might be predetermined for some of the descriptors.

.2 Comparisons of All Inventoried Components with Component Definition
A preliminary comparison of all inventoried components with the component
definition might be used to eliminate all components that do not or should not
qualify to be part of the portfolio.

.3 Identification of Components
The identification of components is to list all components that qualify to be
part of the portfolio.

.4 Expert Judgment
Expert judgment is often used to assess the inputs needed to identify the compo-
nents. Such judgment and expertise can be applied to any technical and manage-
ment details during this process.

3.2.1.2 Categorization

Tools and techniques for component categorization aim at helping the organization
to facilitate component evaluation by assigning them to predetermined categories.
This helps to compare components that address similar organizational needs and/or
strategic concerns. It also facilitates portfolio balancing later on, by ensuring that
components are selected and managed within a set of categories addressing all of the
strategic objectives of the organization.
As noted in Chapter 3, these categories need to be defined and widely understood
throughout the organization. The categories may change or evolve if the strategic plan
changes or evolves. A category may include components originating from various
departments or business units of the organization. The number of categories is usually
limited and may include:
● Increased profitability (revenue increase, cost reductions, etc.)
● Risk reduction
● Efficiency improvement
● Legal obligation
● Market share increase
● Process improvement
● Continuous improvement
● Business imperatives (e.g., internal tool kit, IT compatibility or upgrades).

Each category may a lso inc lude subcategories to generate comparat ive tab les,
graphs or charts such as:
● Size (e.g., effort, budget)
● Duration
● Component type (e.g., projects, programs, other work)
● Phase.

At this stage of the portfolio management process, available tools and techniques
include, among others:

.1 Categorization of Components
Each identified component along with the key descriptors is compared to the
categorization criteria and is integrated to a given category for the purpose of
comparing, evaluating, measuring and selecting between similar components.

.2 Expert Judgment
Expert judgment is often used to assess the inputs needed to categorize the
components. Such judgment and expertise is applied to any technical and man-
agement details during this process.

3.2.1.3 Evaluation

Figure 3. Tools and Techniques for Evaluation Process

Tools and techniques for evaluation aim at helping the organization to effectively
evaluate and compare the categorized components under consideration, in order to
eventually recommend those that should be selected for further prioritization and
inclusion in a balanced portfolio. This is done by using a series of preset criteria
associated to various business concerns. Typical criteria may include, but are not
limited to:
● Business criteria
䡩 Strategic alignment
䡩 Productivity
䡩 Process improvement
䡩 Competitive advantage
䡩 Business impact
䡩 Employee satisfaction
䡩 Customer satisfaction
䡩 Intellectual property
䡩 Impact of not undertaking the project.
● Financial benefits criteria
䡩 Revenue growth
䡩 Cost savings
䡩 Cost avoidance
䡩 Internal Rate of Return (IRR)
䡩 Net Present Value (NPV)
䡩 Return on Investment (ROI)
䡩 Payback period
䡩 Cost
䡩 Cash flow generation.
● Risk-related criteria
䡩 Business risks
䡩 Technology risks
䡩 Project management risks
䡩 Implementation risks
䡩 Market acceptance risks
䡩 Public relation risks
䡩 Brand image risks.
● Legal/Regulatory compliance criteria

03-29-06 14:41:44

● Human Resource (HR)-related criteria
䡩 Specific competency
䡩 Employee satisfaction
䡩 Resources availability
䡩 HR capacity
䡩 HR capacity to integrate the solution
䡩 Impact on working condition.
● Marketing criteria
䡩 Market impact
䡩 Probability of success
䡩 Time to market
䡩 Impact on existing product lines
䡩 Estimated product life.
● Technical criteria
䡩 Architectural alignment
䡩 Information delivery
䡩 Success probability (inverse of risk)
䡩 System RAS
• Reliability
• Availability
• Supportability
䡩 Conformity to standards.

At this stage of the portfolio management process, available tools and techniques
include, among others:

.1 Scoring Model Comprising Weighted Key Criteria
Scoring models are used to evaluate each component. As illustrated in Figure
4, a scoring model comprises a series of evaluation criteria having a weight
expressed as a percentage and a score. The evaluation criteria may comprise

Figure 4. Multi-Criteria Scoring Model

©2006 Project Management Institute, Four Campus Boulevard, Newtown Square, PA 19073-3299 USA

63

89513$$CH7

03-29-06 14:41:44

items such as strategic alignment, business unit priorities alignment, contractual
requirement, financial benefits, soft benefits, risks, etc. The weight for each
criterion is expressed in percentage and determines the relative importance of
each criterion in the component evaluation. The score applies to each criterion
and should be discriminating (such as 0, 5, 10). The score measures if each
criterion is met or not. Each score level must be clearly defined to ensure
consistent evaluation from project to project. The score multiplied by the weight
provides a value for each criterion and the total of all these criteria values is
the total value of the component.
A typical scoring model can be effectively designed and used by going through
the following simple implementation steps:
● Establish a list of criteria
● Define groups of criteria, if and whenever possible, to build specific key
indicators that need more than one criterion to be properly evaluated (ex.
criteria 1 to 6 ⳱ Indicator ‘‘Y’’)
● Establish a relative weight between the criteria
● Determine the evaluation scoring model to be used, for example:
䡩 0, 5, 10
䡩 1 to 10
䡩 1 to 5
● Evaluate the project(s) under consideration for each criterion
● Multiply the evaluation by the weight to get a total per criterion
● Add the totals for each criterion to get the total score for the project(s)
● Compare project results.

.2 Graphical Representations
Various graphical representations may also be used to illustrate the relationship
between the components being evaluated. Graphical representations include

Figure 5. Graphical Comparison Based on Two Criteria

89513$$CH7

03-29-06 14:41:44

such things as histograms, pie charts, line charts, and bubble charts. Two-criteria
comparison grids, like the example illustrated in Figure 5, are among the most
utilized and effective graphical tools to compare components that must meet
more that one selection criterion. A typical pair of criteria used by organizations
is benefits (criterion. 1) vs. strategic alignment (criterion 2).
One can effectively design and use a two-criteria comparison grid by using
the following simple implementation steps:
● Choose two criteria
● Measure each project under each criterion
● Position each project in the grid, for example:
䡩 For Project XYZ: criterion 1⳱medium and criterion 2⳱medium
● Projects evaluated HIGH have a high score
● Project evaluated LOW have a low score
● The grid can be color-coded to indicate which combinations of criteria values
are privileged by the organization and which are to be avoided, for example:
䡩 Projects positioned in the ‘‘red zone’’ have low value for the organization
䡩 Projects positioned in the ‘‘green zone’’ have high value for the organization
Graphical representations are usually done to compare projects within a
category, in order to prevent comparing components that do not address similar
organizational concerns and/or objectives.

.3 Expert Judgment
Expert judgment is often used to assess the inputs needed to compare the
components. Such judgment and expertise are applied to any technical and
management details during this process.

3.2.1.4 Selection

Figure 6. Tools and Techniques for Component Selection

Tools and techniques for component selection aim at helping the organization to
effectively reduce, if and whenever possible, the number of components that will be
considered for further prioritization and inclusion in a balanced portfolio. This might
be done by using the results of the scoring model to eliminate those components not
meeting ‘‘acceptance threshold scores’’ with respect to one or several predetermined
criteria and/or indicators.
At this stage of the portfolio management process, available tools and techniques
to complement and/or validate, if and whenever required, the results of the scoring

model to ensure the most desirable components are selected for inclusion in the
portfolio, include, among others:

.1 Human Resource Capacity Analyses
A human resource capacity analysis must be conducted to understand the capac-
ity of the organization to source and execute the selected projects. The analysis
must be done by skill sets to understand the constraint generated by certain
skill-set limitations. Internal resource capacity must be measured and external
resource availability must be established to have a complete capacity picture.
The human resource capacity will be a limiting factor for the number a projects
that the organization can execute.

.2 Financial Capacity Analyses
A financial resource capacity analysis must be conducted to understand the
capacity of the organization to finance the selected projects. The analysis must
be done through the financial and/or budget process of the organization. Internal
financial capacity must be measured and external financial capacity availability
must be established to have a complete capacity picture. The financial resource
capacity will be a limiting factor for the number of projects that the organization
can execute.

.3 Asset Capacity Analyses
An asset resource capacity analysis must be conducted to understand the physi-
cal needs of the organization to support the selected projects. The analysis must
be done by type of assets (equipment, building, etc.) to understand the constraint
generated by certain asset limitations. The asset capacity will be a limiting factor
for the number of projects that the organization can execute.

.4 Expert Judgment
Expert judgment is often used to assess the inputs needed to select the compo-
nents. Such judgment and expertise is applied to any technical and management
details during this process.

3.2.1.5 Prioritization

Figure 7. Tools and Techniques for Component Prioritization

89513$$CH7

03-29-06 14:41:44

Tools and techniques for component prioritization aim at helping the organization to
effectively choose, if and wherever possible, which components will be prioritized
over others to be programmed in a timely fashion for inclusion in a balanced portfolio.
This might be done by using the same criteria and indicators used in the scoring
model to evaluate and select components. In this case, however, the components will
be compared as being part of a whole with many criteria to be met both as separated
and combined entities, in an effort to prioritize them in a coherent way, ensuring the
best alignment possible with the strategic plan.
At this stage of the portfolio management process, available tools and techniques
include, among others:

.1 Weighted Ranking
In this case, prioritization usually involves the simple ranking of components within
each category based on values assigned. Components are ranked from high to low
(or low to high depending upon the organization’s preference) according to pre-
established criteria.

Figure 8. Single Criterion Prioritization Model

Figure 9. Multiple Criteria Weighted Ranking

Ranking can be done using one or more criteria, as illustrated in Figures 8 and 9.
The single criterion approach, as illustrated above, is usually a pair comparison

of different projects with one another, to rank them hierarchically from the one
that should be given the highest priority to the one(s) that should not be undertaken
within a given portfolio cycle. In the example presented in Figure 8, each project
is compared to each of the others, then scored and prioritized using the following
steps:
● If project A has more value than project B, score 1
● If project B has less value than project C, score 0
● Add scores horizontally for each project
● The project with the highest score becomes the first priority.
A multiple criterion model for weighted ranking, as the one illustrated in Figure
9, can be designed and used effectively by going through the following simple
implementation steps:
● Choose a series of evaluation criteria
● Measure each project for each criterion
● Rank projects for each criterion
● For each project, add the rank number and divide by the number of criteria
measured to produce the score
● Determine the priority based on the score (the lowest score giving the highest
priority).

.2 Scoring Techniques
The numerical methods that are used to consolidate ranked components within
each category, as illustrated in Figure 9.

.3 Expert Judgment
Expert judgment is often used to assess the inputs needed to determine how to
prioritize components. Such judgment and expertise is applied to any technical
and management details during this process.

3.2.1.6 Portfolio Balancing

Figure 10. Tools and Techniques for Portfolio Balancing

Tools and techniques for portfolio balancing aim at helping the organization to effec-
tively select and implement a portfolio ensuring the best overall alignment possible
with the strategic plan. Portfolio components can be balanced with one another,
usually within the same category (categorization also being an attempt to balance
components to address all of the diverse concerns and objectives of the organization),

using a variety of qualitative and quantitative methods and software tools to support
the decision-making process and allocate budget.
At this stage of the portfolio management process, available tools and techniques
include, among others:

.1 Cost Benefit Analysis
Any financial analytical method preferred by the organization. These methods
may include: Net Present Value (NPV), Discounted Cash Flow (DCF), Internal
Rate of Return (IRR), cost benefit ratio, payback, and options analysis.

.2 Quantitative Analysis
Quantitative analysis may include the use of spreadsheets or other tools to
examine factors of interest such as resource loading requirements over time or
cash flow, for example.

.3 Scenario Analysis
This analytical method enables decision makers to create a variety of portfolio
scenarios using different combinations of both potential components and cur-
rent components. The analysis can be further enhanced by incorporating numer-
ous baselines.

.4 Probability Analysis
These methods may include decision trees, flowcharts, and Monte Carlo simula-
tion. Components are evaluated using success and failure probabilities for esti-
mated cost, anticipated revenues, risk, and other desired criteria.

.5 Graphical Analytical Methods
These are graphical methods such as risk vs. return charts, histograms, pie
charts, and other methods to evaluate the portfolio. The next two figures present
some of the graphical representations most often used by organizations to bal-
ance and monitor their portfolios.
Figure 11 presents a typical bubble graph that help compare and balance
portfolio components according to some pre-established ‘‘balancing and moni-
toring’’ criteria. A bubble graph uses indicators from the scoring model or new
indicators concerned with portfolio balance:
● Each bubble is a project
● Bubble size often represents an additional variable such as cost or net present
value
● Bubble color might refer to a specific category or any other qualitative crite-
rion required to measure balance.
Figure 12 illustrates another variance of the bubble graph, displaying portfolio
components according to the category they belong to as well as according to
the business unit impacted/targeted by the component to be implemented. The
bubble graph also uses other indicators from the scoring model or new indicators
concerned with portfolio balance:
● Each bubble is a project
● Bubble size often represents an additional variable such as cost or net present
value
● Bubble color might refer to a specific qualitative criteria required to mea-
sure balance.

Figure 13. Tools and Techniques for Component Authorization

Tools and techniques for component authorization are mainly concerned with helping
the organization to effectively communicate the decisions with respect to components
included in the balanced portfolio and to assign roles, responsibilities, and perfor-
mance milestones for their implementation and monitoring.
At this stage of the portfolio management process, available tools and techniques
include, among others:

.1 Portfolio Management Roles & Responsibilities Document
The portfolio management roles & responsibilities document identifies stake-
holders, defines roles, and specifies responsibilities for all participants in the
portfolio management process.

.2 Portfolio Management Communication Plan
The portfolio management communication plan defines all communication needs,
establishes communication requirements, specifies frequency, and identifies recipi-
ents for information associated with the portfolio management process.

Tools and techniques for periodic reporting and review are mainly concerned with
helping the organization to effectively monitor its portfolio to ensure that it is still
balanced as a whole and that its individual components stay aligned and perform
as expected.
At this stage of the portfolio management process, available tools and techniques
include, among others:

.1 Project/Portfolio Management System
The portfolio management system is the central, typically electronic, repository
for component-level information that can be rolled up for management analysis
and decisions. It can exchange information with the systems and applications
used by components.

.2 Financial Reporting Systems
Like the portfolio management system, the financial systems provide data that
managers use to determine whether components should be removed, repriori-
tized or realigned within the portfolio.

.3 Performance Measurement Techniques
Progress measurement techniques. The tools and techniques used at the portfolio
level are similar to those used in a component, such as earned value.
Value measurement techniques. The portfolio is also interested in the value
resulting from the component’s progress, and how the component is contribut-
ing to the strategic goals. This is where management applies performance indica-
tors and models which the organization may be using to measure strategic
performance.

.4 Graphical Representations
Progress measurement techniques can also use graphical representations to
help compare desired and/or planned situations with actual situations.
A typical graphical tool used is the ‘‘traffic light’’ analogy. Performance results
are compared to planned/desired values for different indicators using a three-
color coding representation:
● GREEN—evolution/forecast situation in line with desired results
● YELLOW— some difficulty encountered/perceived but effective corrective
action possible or being implemented
● RED—critical situation calling for replanning, an urgent intervention, that
might even inc lude postponing implementation or term inat ing the com-
ponent
● With an identified scale acceptable by all which needs to be defined in the
graph.
‘‘Radar’’ graphs can also be used to compare a project evolution with its desired
performance and/or g loba l portfo l io performance cr iter ia , as i l lustrated in
Figure 15.
The same type of graphical tool can also be used to compare several compo-
nents as they evolve either between themselves or with preset global portfolio
performance indicators, in order, for example, to see global tendencies towards
the respect of specific criteria and uncover a possible systemic issue affecting
the portfolio as a whole.

Figure 15. Graphical Representation of a Project and How It Performs Compared to
Preset Performance Criteria

Bubble graphs similar to Figures 11 and 12 can also be redrawn using new
current components’ performance results and other characteristics, and com-
pared to the results of the prior balancing step to see the evolution of the
portfolio and its components over time and ensure that the desired overall
balance and alignment are being maintained.

.5 Portfolio Management Resources
Depending on the organization’s size and complexity, the portfolio may be
managed by a single person or a team, and decisions regarding components
may be made by senior management or a specially chartered ‘‘review board.’’

3.2.2.2 Strategic Change

Tools and techniques for tracking and taking into account strategic changes aim at
helping the organization to effectively take into account new business conditions
arising over time. These should help measure the effect of these new conditions on
the organization’s current strategy, as well as to determine what has to be done. This
might include putting into place new criteria/indicators and/or new criteria weights
to re-evaluate the portfolio and realign and balance its current components or newly
required components to respond to those strategic changes.
At this stage of the portfolio management process, available tools and techniques
include, among others:

.1 Expert Judgment
Expert judgment is often used to assess the inputs needed to determine whether
a strategic change will occur and what will be its effect on the current portfolio.

.2 Criteria Reweighting
Changing business conditions might necessitate reconsideration of the original
criteria used for both aligning and monitoring the project portfolio and its
components. This will result in a change in the weights assigned to key indicators
and criteria and/or the inclusion of new criteria for the subsequent realignment
of the components to address new business conditions.

.3 Graphical Representations
Graphical representations can also be used to illustrate required changes to
portfolio management criteria, following a change in business conditions. The
example illustrated in Figure 17, shows that strategic changes due to some new
business conditions call for the reweighting of two of the six criteria used for
portfolio management by the impacted organization

Two Criteria

Phase-to-Phase Relationships 

There are three basic types of phase – to – phase relationships :

A Sequential relationship : where a phase can only start once the 
previous phase is complete 

An Overlapping relationship : where the phase starts prior to 
completion of the previous one ( Fastracking ). Overlapping phase 
may increase risk and can result in rework .

An Iterative relationship : where only one phase is planned at any 
given time and the planning for the next is carried out as work 
progresses on the current phase and deliverables

requested. 

 Second, all change requests must come through the formal change

organization.

 The CCB may meet only once a week, once every other week, or even once a month, 
depending on the project.

 When emergencies arise, the pre-established procedures allow the project manager 
to implement the change on the spot.

 CCB members may include stakeholders, managers, project team members, and 
others who may not have any connection to the project at hand.

 Some other names you might see are technical assessment board (TAB), technical 
review board (TRB), engineering review board (ERB), and change control board

5.3 Create WBS

 What is Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)
 What is Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)

 The WBS is a deliverables-orientated decomposition of the work to 
be executed by project team in a project. WBS is not an 
organization structure of project or product breakdown. 

 Work that doesn’t fit into the WBS does not fit within the 
project.

 Projects are normally too big to manage and WBS breaks the 
project works into smaller more manageable components arranged 
according to deliverables. 

 This is a top down effort, break works from top to down

 More about WBS

 Each level of WBS is a smaller piece of level above.

 The top most level of each WBS is the total project itself

 Work is broken down to the lowest level possible till further division is 
logically not possible or the work can be confidently estimated and 
scheduled.

 WBS represents total work specified in the current approved scope 
 WBS represents total work specified in the current approved scope 
statement and shall be revised if a major scope change occurs.

1. Decomposition
1. Decomposition

 This technique involves breaking down the deliverables into 
smaller,  more manageable components of work.

 The idea here is to break down the deliverables to a point where 
you can easily plan, execute, monitor and control, and close out 
the project deliverables.

 Each level of WBS is a more detailed definition of the level above 
it.

 Detailed decomposition of work may not be possible for works 
 Detailed decomposition of work may not be possible for works 
that will be completed in the future since project team is not 
fully aware of details of work. Team waits for the more details 
and only work in the near future is decomposed. This is called 
Rolling Wave Planning 

 Work in the near term is elaborated in more detail than work 
 Work in the near term is elaborated in more detail than work 
to performed in the future.

 Each WBS levels represents a breakdown of WBS level 
 Each WBS levels represents a breakdown of WBS level 
above.

 Lowest level is called work package

 If the lowest levels are rolled up to the higher levels, the total 
must represents the total work of the project. This is called 
100% rule. 

 This ensures that no work is left out or extra work is added.

smaller components  and decomposition in define activities 
smaller components  and decomposition in define activities 
subdivide work package in to smaller, more manageable 
components called activities. 

 WBS and WBS dictionary are the basis for development of 
activities.

the past, rely on the WBS and activity lists from the historical 
the past, rely on the WBS and activity lists from the historical 
information to serve as a template for the current project.

 Templates can also be used to identify typical schedule milestones.

 Mandatory dependencies are those that are contractually required 
or inherent in the nature of work. This dependency is also called 
Hard Logic.

 For example, you can’t begin building your house until your foundation 
is in place.

 Contract says prototype must be approved prior to start work.

Dependency Determination

 Discretionary dependencies:
 Discretionary dependencies:

 These dependencies are the preferred order of activities. It is 
defined by the project management team based on the knowledge 
of best practice in each field.

 These relationship are also known as soft logic, preferred logic, or 
preferential logic.

 Discretionary dependencies shall be fully documented since they 
can create arbitrary total float values and can limit later scheduling 
options.

 When fast tracking is applied, normally these dependencies are 
reviewed or removed.

 A Lead may be added to start an activity before the predecessor activity is 
finished. The successor activity may be started prior to completion or 
predecessor.  

Ex: Furniture may be installed 2 weeks prior to completion of painting 
(Finish to start relationship with 2 weeks lead)  

 Lag introduces waiting period between activities. Lag introduces a delay in 
the successor activity

2. Alternative Analysis

 Many activities can be completed in different ways and using 
various resource allocations. Alternative analysis is used to choose 
the best way to complete an activity.

 You can also consider make-or-buy analysis when determining 
alternatives. Hiring a tower crane may be less costlier than buying 
in short term perspective but buying may be better for organization 
in long term.

 When an activity cannot be estimated with a reasonable degree of 
confidence, the work within the activity is decomposed into more 
detail.

 The resource needs are estimated.

 These estimates are then aggregated into a total quantity for each 
of the activities resources.

6.4 Estimate Activity Durations : Tools & Techniques  

3. Parametric Estimating

 Parametric estimate uses a statistical relationship between 
historical data and other variables.

 More accurate than analogous estimate

 Example : A resource will take 20hrs per module and hence 1000 
modules will take 50hrs (50X20 = 1000hrs)

 Estimation is done by multiplying quantity of work by labor hours 
per unit of work.

1. Schedule Network Analysis.
1. Schedule Network Analysis.

 Schedule network analysis is a technique that generates the 
project schedule. It employs a schedule model and various 
analytical techniques, such as critical path method, critical chain 
method, what-if analysis, and resource leveling to develop the 
schedule.

2. Critical Path Method

 The critical path method is a schedule network analysis 
technique that is performed using the schedule model.

 The critical path method calculates the early start and finish 
dates, and late start and finish dates for all schedule 
activities

Floats

 Floats are not same as lead or lag

 Lead or lags are introduced (manually) to correct the sequence while float is 
calculated in CPM method

 Float = LS-ES or LF-EF 

 Float for all activities on critical path will be zero

 If lead or lag is introduced to activities

- Duration of activities may change (Increase or Decrease)

- Critical path may change. CPM calculation is not affected but total duration 
of project may alter.

- Lead reduces the duration and hence negative value and lag increases 
the duration and have positive value.

without delaying the project end date or milestone.

 Free Float – The amount of time an activity can be delayed 
without delaying the early start date of successor activity

 Project Float – The amount of time a project can be delayed 
without delaying an externally imposed project completion 
date (other than calculated by CPM) by customer. Normally 
project floats are zero unless CPM calculations shows an 
earlier completion date than required by customer.

 According to Parkinson’s Law, “Work expands to time it is given”

 “Student Syndrome” – Many people will start to fully apply 
themselves to task just the wake of deadline. 

 Due to padding, activity expands to the time given and most of the 
work associated with activity will be done near the deadline. 
work associated with activity will be done near the deadline. 

 Buffer built in to each activity is inefficient and normally lead to 
extended schedule. Critical chain method removes buffers from 
activities and manage them separately. 

 It is unlikely that all activities will suffer delays (Insurance idea)

3. Critical Chain Analysis

 Remove buffers from individual activities in conventional CPM 

 Calculate critical chain using CPM

 Enter resource and recalculate the critical path. Normally critical path 
alters and now the path is called resource-constrained critical path. 

 Now add one buffer at the end of the critical chain to protect the target 
finish date due to slippage in critical chain. This is called project 
buffer.
buffer.

 Critical chain normally have non critical paths feeding (or connected) 
to critical path. In order to protect critical path due to slippage in non 
critical path, another buffer is placed at the end of non critical path, 
before it get connected to critical path. This is called feed buffer.

4. Resource Leveling

 Critical path is calculated using CPM. 

 Resources are loaded to activities based on actual availability or 
considering conflicts. 

 Resource leveling often result a change in originally calculated Critical 
Path. 

 Preference is normally always given to critical path activities and floats 
available for non critical path is used during leveling.

 What-if scenario analysis uses different sets of activity assumptions to 
produce multiple project durations.

 For e.g., what would happen if a major deliverable was delayed or the weather 
prevents you from completing a deliverable on time ?

 What-if analysis weighs these questions and their assumptions and 
determines the feasibility of the project schedule under these conditions.

 Monte Carlo analysis use a range of probable activity durations for 
 Monte Carlo analysis use a range of probable activity durations for 
each activity, and those ranges are then used to calculate a range of 
probable duration results for the project itself.

 It runs the possible activity durations and schedule projections many times to 
come up with the schedule projections and their probability, critical path 
duration estimates, and float time.

schedule without changing the scope. 

 Need for compression occurs if a customer need a date prior to end 
date shown in original schedule or to bring back a project schedule 
back to baseline.

 Crashing – This approach adds more resources to activities on the critical path 
to complete the project earlier. Crashing almost always result in increased 
cost. Many options are considered and the option with maximum compression 
cost. Many options are considered and the option with maximum compression 
with minimum cost impact is selected.

 Fast Tracking –Critical activities that would normally be done in sequence are 
allowed to be done in parallel or with some overlap. Fast track may result in 
rework and increases the risk. Communication requirements increases during 
fast tracking.

8. Scheduling Tool

 Automated scheduling tools expedite the scheduling process by 
generating start and finish dates based on the inputs of the activities , 
network diagrams, resources and activity durations.

 A scheduling tool can be used in conjunction with other project 
management software applications as well as manual methods

Quick Facts Cost Management

 Costing is different from Pricing. Costing includes the monetary resource 
required to complete the project and pricing normally include a profit margin.

 Costing is based on WBS and controlled by Control Accounts

 Costing shall be ideally done by a team who perform the work

 Schedule get affected by funding and project manager shall manage the link 
with organization

 Padding is not a good practice

 Final schedule can be done only after costing and final costing can only be 
done after risk since risk management involves budget for handling risk

Cost Management

 Life Cycle Cost - Project cost management is primarily concerned with 
cost needed to complete project activities however project cost management 
cost needed to complete project activities however project cost management 
shall consider the effect of project decisions on the subsequent recurring cost 
of operation, maintenance and support of deliverables. Remember the 
product life cycle. 

 Some decisions on project cost management have direct impact on future 
recurring cost. Example – Reduction in some features of project may reduce 
project cost but may make future operations more difficult and hence 
resulting overall more cost to organizations.

 Some project costing may involve predicting and analyzing the future 
financial performance of deliverables and may include techniques such as 
financial performance of deliverables and may include techniques such as 
Return on Investments (ROI), Discounted Cash Flow and Investment Pay 
Back Analysis.

Project Cost Estimating

 Types of Cost

 Cost can be Direct or Indirect
 Cost can be Direct or Indirect

 Direct costs These costs are attributed directly to the project work and 
cannot be shared among projects (Wages, Material, Equipment etc).

 Indirect costs Overhead costs that incurred for the benefit of more than 
one project (Taxes, Training, project management software license, and so 
on).

Cost can be Direct or Indirect

 Variable costs Costs that vary depending on the amount of work or 
production (Cost of materials, supplies, wages etc..).

 Fixed costs These costs remain constant throughout the project (Cost of 
office setup, rentals etc...).

7.1 Estimate Costs : Tools & Techniques 

2. Analogous Estimating

 Analogous estimating relies on historical information to predict the 
cost of the current project. It is also known as top-down estimating. 

 The process of analogous estimating takes the actual cost of a 
historical project as a basis for the current project. 

 Analogous estimating uses historical data and expert judgment.

 Less costlier than other methods, faster but less accurate

1. Activity Cost Estimates

 The output of cost estimating is the actual cost estimates of the resources 
required to complete the project work.

 Each resource in the project must be accounted for and assigned to a cost 
category. Categories include the following:

 Labor costs

 Material costs

 Travel costs

 Supplies

 Hardware costs

 Software costs

 Special categories (inflation, cost reserve, and so on)

Project Cost Estimating - Estimating Accuracy

 Accuracy of estimate is normally refined during the course of project 
to reflect additional details as it becomes available. 

 Rough order of magnitude This estimate is “rough” and is used 
during the initiating processes and in top-down estimates. The range 
of variance for the estimate can be from +/- 50%.

 Later the estimate can be refined to a range of +/- 10%

 Refinements and range of accuracy depends on policies of 
individual organizations.

2. Basis of estimates

 Once the estimates have been completed, supporting detail must be 
organized and documented to show how the estimates were created. 

 Specifically, the supporting detail includes the following:

 Document basis of estimate (how it was developed)

 Information on the assumptions and constraints made while developing the 
cost estimates.

 Information on the range of variance in the estimate For example, based on 
the estimating method used, the project cost may be $220,000 ± $15,000. 

 Indication of the confidence level of the final estimate

5. Funding Limit Reconciliation

 Funding limit reconciliation is an organization’s approach to managing 
cash flow. 

 Budgeting will result in S curve showing time phased cost 
requirements and project manager shall negotiate fund requirements 
with organization prior to finalization of cost baseline and schedule.

 Changes in funding may results in changes to project management 
 Changes in funding may results in changes to project management

A variation to this is to weight CPI or SPI at different values as per project 
managers judgement (to give weight to schedule performance or cost 
performance as per previous performance). In case of an 70/30 ratio

EAC = AC + ((BAC-EV)/0.7CPIx0.3SPI))

Quality vs. Grade (degree of functionality)

 Grade is a category assigned to products or services having 
the same functional use but different technical characteristics.

 A camera with lots of functions is high grade and a camera 
which takes bad pictures is low quality

 Low Quality is always a problem; low grade may not be.

Precision vs. Accuracy

Precision and Accuracy are not equivalent.
Precision and Accuracy are not equivalent.

 Precision is consistency that the value of repeated measurements 
are clustered and have little scatter.

 Accuracy is correctness that the measured value is very close to the 
true value.

 Precise measurements are not necessarily accurate. A Very 
accurate measurement is not necessarily precise.
accurate measurement is not necessarily precise.

 The Project Management Team must determine how much 
accuracy or precision or both are required.

Purpose: It determines whether or not a process is stable or has predictable 
performance.

 It is a graphic display of the interaction of the process variables within 
acceptable limits

 When a process is outside acceptable limits the process should be 
adjusted.

 The upper control limits and lower control limits are usually set at +/- 3 
sigma (i.e. standard deviation)

 In project, control chart can be used for monitoring of cost and time.

8.1 Plan Quality :  Tools & Techniques

 To draw a control chart, upper and lower control limits are identified. 
Normally control limits are determined by organizations policies

 Specification limit – are normally drawn from contract or customer 
requirement. It may be stringent than control limits

 Mean represent the average of control limits or specification limits

 Out of control – A process is considered out of control if

- A data point falls out of control limits

- Breaks the rule of seven

 Rule of seven – Is a rule of thumb or heuristic. A consecutive seven data 
points one singe side of mean is considered out of control, even though the 
data points are within control limits. 

 Assignable cause / Special Cause Variation – is a data point that 
requires investigation (either out of control limits or breaks rule of seven)

Risk Management - Definitions

 Organizations and stakeholders have different approach towards risks. 
Some organizations or stakeholders are willing to accept risks for the 
return or some not. This is called Risk Tolerances. 

 To be successful, individuals or organizations must explicitly express the 
attitude towards risks and all communications about risks and its handling 
shall be open and honest.

 Project manager normally identify stakeholder risk tolerance levels during 
stakeholder analysis and try to ensure all risk handlings are done 
according to this.

Project Risk Management Processes

1. Plan Risk Management : deciding how to approach and plan the risk 
management activities for the project
management activities for the project

2. Identify Risks : determining which risks are likely to affect a project and 
documenting the characteristics of each

3. Perform Qualitative risk analysis: prioritizing risks for further analysis or action 
based by assessing and combining their probability of occurrence and impact

4. Perform Quantitative risk analysis: numerically estimating the effects of the 
identified risks on overall project objectives

5. Plan Risk Responses: taking steps to enhance opportunities and reduce 
threats to meeting project objectives

6. Monitor and Control Risks : the process of implementing risk response plans , 
monitoring identified and residual risks, identifying new risks, and evaluating the 
effectiveness of risk strategies throughout the life of the project

on the project objectives and the probability they’ll occur. 

 By doing so team can rank the risks in priority order according to their 
effect on the project objectives. Organizations now can achieve better 
results by concentrating of high-priority risks.

 Team now determines if Quantitative Risk Analysis should be performed or 
if you can skip right to developing response plans.

 Risks with lower rating may not qualify for further analysis.

 It can develop an over rating for risks and rating can reflect organizations 
 It can develop an over rating for risks and rating can reflect organizations 
preference for one objective or another.

 Risks that falls in the high priority areas may need priority response and more 
aggressive response plan

 Opportunities that falls in  high risk areas need more attention as that can 
contribute more benefits

 Risks and opportunities that fall in low may not require proactive response plan 
 Risks and opportunities that fall in low may not require proactive response plan 
and can be placed in the Watchlist for future analysis.

done for only high priority risks. Low priority risks are kept in watchlist and 
may qualify for quantitative analysis in future. That is why, a careful 
periodic review of risk watchlist is necessary.

Sensitivity Analysis

 Sensitivity analysis is a method of analyzing the potential impact of risk 
events on the project and determining which risk has the greatest potential 
for impact. All other risks are kept at the baseline while analyzing one risk
for impact. All other risks are kept at the baseline while analyzing one risk

Expected Monetary Value (EMV) Analysis

 Expected monetary value (EMV) analysis is a statistical technique that 
calculates the average, anticipated impact of the decis ion. 
calculates the average, anticipated impact of the decis ion. 

 EMV is calculated by multiplying the probability of the risk times its impact 
and then adding them together.

 For example, one risk may cost the project an additional $10,000 if it 
occurs, but there’s only a 20-percent chance of the event occurring.

 In the simplest form, the expected monetary value of this individual risk 
impact is thus $2,000. Project managers can also find the expected 
impact is thus $2,000. Project managers can also find the expected 
monetary value of a decision by creating a decision tree.

Strategies for Negative Risks or Threats

 Transferring the Negative Risk

 Transference is the process of transferring the risk (and the ownership of 
the risk) to a third party. The risk doesn’t disappear, it’s just someone 
else’s problem. Transference of a risk usually costs a premium for the third 
party to own and manage that risk. Common examples of risk transference 
include

 Insurance

 Performance bonds
 Performance bonds

 Warrantees

 Guarantees

 Fixed-priced contracts

Strategies for Negative Risks or Threats

 Mitigating the Negative Risk

 Mitigating risks is an effort to reduce the probability and/or impact 
of an identified risk in the project. Mitigation is done—based on the 
logic—before the risk happens.

 The cost and time to reduce or eliminate the risks is more cost 
effective than repairing the damage caused by the risk. The risk 
effective than repairing the damage caused by the risk. The risk 
event may still happen, but hopefully the cost and impact of the risk 
will both be very low.

Managing the Positive Risk and Opportunities

 Exploiting the Positive Risk or Opportunities
 Exploiting the Positive Risk or Opportunities

 When an organization would like to ensure that a positive risk 
definitely happens, it can exploit the risk. 

 Positive risk exploitation can be realized by adding resources to 
finish faster than what was originally planned, increasing quality to 
recognize sales and customer satisfaction, utilizing a better way of 
completing the project work—or any other method that creates the 
positive outcomes of the identified risk.

Make or Buy Decision

 Answer:
 Answer:

 Let D equal the number of days when the purchase and lease costs are 
equal.

 QR 120 D = QR 1000 + QR 20 D

 QR 120 D - QR 20 D = QR 1000

 QR 100 D = QR 1000

 D = QR 1000 / QR 100
 D = QR 1000 / QR 100

 D = 10

 The least cost will be the same as the purchase cost after ten days.

Make-or Buy Solution

 Set up an equation so both options, purchase and lease, are equal

 In this example, use the following equation; let d be the number of days 
to use the item:

$12,000 + $400d = $800d

Subtracting $400d from both sides, you get:

$12,000 = $400d
$12,000 = $400d

Dividing both sides by $400, you get:

d = 30

 If you need the item for more than 30 days, it is more economical to 
purchase it

12.4 Close Procurements 

 Close Project verifies and documents the project outcomes 
 Close Project verifies and documents the project outcomes 
just like the Contract Closure process. 

 Keep in mind that not all projects are performed under 
contract so not all projects require Contract Closure. 

 However, all projects do require the Close Project process. 

 Since verification and documentation of the project outcomes 
occur in both of these processes, projects that are performed 
under contract need to have project results verified only one 
time.

12.4 Close Procurements – Tools & Techniques

 The Contract Closure process has three  tools and techniques: 

1. Procurement audits 

2. Records management system.

3. Negotiated Settlements  : In all procurement relationships the final 
equitable settlement of all outstanding issues , claims , and disputes 
by negotiations is a primary goal. Whenever settlement cannot be 
achieved by direct negotiation , some form of alternative dispute 
achieved by direct negotiation , some form of alternative dispute 
resolution (ADR) including mediation or arbitration may be explored . 
When all else fails , litigation in the courts is the least desirable 
option
