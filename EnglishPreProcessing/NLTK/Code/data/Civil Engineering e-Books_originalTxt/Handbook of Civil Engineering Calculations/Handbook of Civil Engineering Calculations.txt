PARTl

STATICS, STRESS AND STRAIN,
AND FLEXURAL ANALYSIS

Principles of Statics;
Geometric Properties of Areas

If a body remains in equilibrium under a system of forces, the following conditions
obtain:
1. The algebraic sum of the components of the forces in any given direction is zero.
2. The algebraic sum of the moments of the forces with respect to any given axis is zero.
The above statements are verbal expressions of the equations of equilibrium. In the ab-
sence of any notes to the contrary, a clockwise moment is considered positive; a counter-
clockwise moment, negative.

GRAPHICAL ANALYSIS OFA
FORCE SYSTEM

The body in Fig.

String

Ray

Force line

( b) Force polygon

( a) Space diagram and
string polygon
FIGURE 1. Equilibrant of force system.

Calculation Procedure:

1. Construct the system force line

In Fig. Ib, draw the vector chain A-B-C, which is termed the force line. The vector ex-
tending from the initial point to the terminal point of the force line represents the resultant
R. In any force system, the resultant R is equal to and collinear with the equilibrant E, but
acts in the opposite direction. The equilibrant of a force system is a single force that will
balance the system.

2. Construct the system rays

Selecting an arbitrary point O as the pole, draw the rays from O to the ends of the vectors
and label them as shown in Fig. Ib.

3. Construct the string polygon

In Fig. Ia, construct the string polygon as follows: At an arbitrary point a on the action
line of force A, draw strings parallel to rays or and ab. At the point where the string ab in-
tersects the action line of force B, draw a string parallel to ray be. At the point where
string be intersects the action line of force C, draw a string parallel to cr. The intersection
point Q ofar and cr lies on the action line of R.

4. Draw the vector for the resultant and equilibrant

In Fig. Ia, draw the vector representing R. Establish the magnitude and direction of this
vector from the force polygon. The action line of R passes through Q.
Last, draw a vector equal to and collinear with that representing R but opposite in di-
rection. This vector represents the equilibrant E.
Related Calculations: Use this general method for any force system acting in a
single plane. With a large number offerees, the resultant of a smaller number offerees
can be combined with the remaining forces to simplify the construction.

Bar

FIGURE 2. Equilibrant of force system.

ANALYSIS OF STATIC FRICTION

The bar in Fig. 2a weighs 100 Ib (444.8 N) and is acted on by a force P that makes an an-
gle of 55° with the horizontal. The coefficient of friction between the bar and the inclined
plane is 0.20. Compute the minimum value of P required (a) to prevent the bar from slid-
ing down the plane; (b) to cause the bar to move upward along the plane.

Calculation Procedure:

1. Select coordinate axes

Establish coordinate axes x and y through the center of the bar, parallel and perpendicular
to the plane, respectively.

2. Draw a free-body diagram of the system

In Fig. 2b, draw a free-body diagram of the bar. The bar is acted on by its weight W, the
force P, and the reaction R of the plane on the bar. Show R resolved into its jc andy com-
ponents, the former being directed upward.

3. Resolve the forces into their components

The forces W and P are the important ones in this step, and they must he resolved into
their x and y components. Thus
Wx = -100 sin 40 ° = -64.3 Ib (-286.0 N)
Wy = -100 cos 40° = -76.6 Ib (-340.7 N)
Px = P cos 15°- 0.966P
P^ = P s m l 5° = 0.259P

4. Apply the equations of equilibrium

Consider that the bar remains at rest and apply the equations of equilibrium. Thus
ZFx = RX + 0.966P - 64.3 = 0 
Rx = 64.3 - 0.966P
^Fy = Ry + 0.259P - 76.6 = 0 
Ry = 76.6 - 0.259P

5. Assume maximum friction exists and solve for the applied force

Assume that Rx, which represents the frictional resistance to motion, has its maximum po-
tential value. Apply Rx = ^Ry, where 
JJL = coefficient of friction. Then Rx = Q.2QRy =

0.20(76.6 - 0.259P) - 15.32 - 0.052P. Substituting for Rx from step 4 yields 64.3 -
0.966P - 15.32 - 0.052P; so P = 53.6 Ib (238.4 N).

6. Draw a second free-body diagram

In Fig. 2c, draw a free-body diagram of the bar, with Rx being directed downward.

7. Solve as In steps 1 through 5

As before, Ry = 76.6 - 0.259P. Also the absolute value of Rx = 0.966P - 64.3. But Rx =
0.20^, = 15.32 x 0.052P. Then 0.966P - 64.3 = 15.32 - 0.052P; so P = 78 2 Ib (347 6N).

ANALYSIS OFA STRUCTURAL FRAME

The frame in Fig. 30 consists of two inclined members and a tie rod. What is the tension
in the rod when a load of 1000 Ib (4448.0 N) is applied at the hinged apex? Neglect the
weight of the frame and consider the supports to be smooth.

Tie rod

Calculation Procedure:

1. Draw a free-body diagram of
the frame

Since friction is absent in this frame, the
reactions at the supports are vertical.
Draw a free-body diagram as in Fig. 3b.
With the free-body diagram shown,
compute the distances X1 and Jc2. Since
the frame forms a 3-4-5 right triangle, X1
= 16(4/5) = 12.8 ft (3.9 m) and X2 =
12(3/5) -7.2 ft (2.2m).

2. Determine the reactions on
the frame

Take moments with respect to A and B to
obtain the reactions:
^MB = 20/^-1000(7.2) = O
SM4 = 1000(12.8) - 20RR = O
R1 = 360 Ib (1601.2 N)
RR = 640 Ib (2646.7 N)

3. Determine the distance y in
Fig. 3c

Draw a free-body diagram of member A C
in Fig. 3c. Compute y = 13(3/5) = 7.8 ft
(2.4 m).

4. Compute the tension in the
tie rod

Take moments with respect to C to find
the tension Tin the tie rod:
^Mc= 360(12.8) -7 .8 f= O
T= 591 Ib (2628.8 N)

FIGURE 3

5. Verify the computed result

Draw a free-body diagram of member BC, and take moments with respect to C. The result
verifies that computed above.

GRAPHICAL ANALYSIS OFA PLANE TRUSS

Apply a graphical analysis to the cantilever truss in Fig. 4a to evaluate the forces induced
in the truss members.

Calculation Procedure:

1. Label the truss for analysis

Divide the space around the truss into regions bounded by the action lines of the external
and internal forces. Assign an uppercase letter to each region (Fig. 4).

2. Determine the reaction force

Take moments with respect to joint 8 (Fig. 4) to determine the horizontal component of
the reaction force R17. Then compute RU. Thus SM8 = RUH- 3(8 + 16 + 24) - 5(6 + 12 +
18) = O, so RUH = 21 kips (120.1 kN) to the right.
Since Rv is collinear with the force DE, RUV/RUH = 12/24> so Ruv =13 .5 kips (60.0 kN)
upward, and RU = 30.2 kips (134.3 kN).

3. Apply the equations of equilibrium

Use the equations of equilibrium to find R1. Thus RLH = 27 kips (120.1 kN) to the left,
RLV= 10.5 kips (46.7 kN) upward, andRL = 29.0 kips (129.0 kN).

4. Construct the force polygon

Draw the force polygon in Fig. 4b by using a suitable scale and drawing vector fg to rep-
resent force FG. Next, draw vector gh to represent force GH, and so forth. Omit the ar-
rowheads on the vectors.

5. Determine the forces in the truss members

Starting at joint 1, Fig. 4b, draw a line through a in the force polygon parallel to member
AJ in the truss, and one through h parallel to member HJ. Designate the point of intersec-
tion of these lines as/ Now, vector aj represents the force in A J, and vector hj represents
the force in HJ.

6. Analyze the next joint in the truss

Proceed to joint 2, where there are now only two unknown forces—BK and JK. Draw a
line through b in the force polygon parallel to BK and one through y parallel to JK. Desig-
nate the point of intersection as k. The forces BK and JK are thus determined.

7. Analyze the remaining joints

Proceed to joints 3, 4, 5, and 6, in that order, and complete the force polygon by continu-
ing the process. If the construction is accurately performed, the vector pe will parallel the
member PE in the truss.

8. Determine the magnitude of the internal forces

Scale the vector lengths to obtain the magnitude of the internal forces. Tabulate the results
as in Table 1.

9. Establish the character of the internal forces

To determine whether an internal force is one of tension or compression, proceed in this
way: Select a particular joint and proceed around the joint in a clockwise direction, listing
the letters in the order in which they appear. Then refer to the force polygon pertaining to

4 pane ls

(o) Truss d iagram

FIGURE 4

(b) Force polygon

that joint, and proceed along the polygon in the same order. This procedure shows the di-
rection in which the force is acting at that joint.
For instance, by proceeding around joint 4, CNMKB is obtained. By tracing a path
along the force polygon in the order in which the letters appear, force CN is found to act
upward to the right; NM acts upward to the left; MK and KB act downward to the left.
Therefore, CN, MK, and KB are directed away from the joint (Fig. 4); this condition dis-

closes that they are tensile forces. Force NM is directed toward the joint; therefore, it is
compressive.
The validity of this procedure lies in the drawing of the vectors representing external
forces while proceeding around the truss in a clockwise direction. Tensile forces are
shown with a positive sign in Table 1; compressive forces are shown with a negative sign.
Related Calculations: Use this general method for any type of truss.

TRUSS ANALYSIS BY THE METHOD
OFJOINTS

Applying the method of joints, determine the forces in the truss in Fig. 5a. The load at
joint 4 has a horizontal component of 4 kips (17.8 kN) and a vertical component of 3 kips
(13.3 kN).

Calculation Procedure:

1. Compute the reactions at the supports

Using the usual analysis techniques, we find RLV = 19 kips (84.5 kN); RLH = 4 kips (17.8
kN); RR = 21 kips (93.4 kN).

2. List each truss member and its slope

Table 2 shows each truss member and its slope.

3. Determine the forces at a principal joint

Draw a free-body diagram, Fig. 5b, of the pin at joint 1. For the free-body diagram, as-
sume that the unknown internal forces AJ and HJ are tensile. Apply the equations of equi-
librium to evaluate these forces, using the subscripts H and V, respectively, to identify the
horizontal and vertical components. Thus ^FH = 4.0 + AJn + HJ = O and ^Fv = 19.0 +

AJV= O; /. AJV= 19.0 kips (-84.5 kN); AJn = - 19.0/0.75 = -25.3 kips (-112.5 kN). Sub-
stituting in the first equation gives HJ= 21.3 kips (94.7 kN).
The algebraic signs disclose that AJ is compressive and HJ is tensile. Record these re-
sults in Table 2, showing the tensile forces as positive and compressive forces as nega-
tive.

4. Determine the forces at another joint

Draw a free-body diagram of the pin at joint 2 (Fig. 5c). Show the known force AJ as
compressive, and assume that the unknown forces BK and JK are tensile. Apply the equa-
tions of equilibrium, expressing the vertical components of BK and JK in terms of their
horizontal components. ThusSF^ =25.3 + BKH + JKH

TRUSS ANALYSIS BY THE METHOD
OFSECTIONS

Using the method of sections, determine the forces in members BK and LM in Fig. 5a.

Calculation Procedure:

1. Draw a free-body diagram of one portion of the truss

Cut the truss at the plane act (Fig. 60), and draw a free-body diagram of the left part of the
truss. Assume that BK is tensile.

2. Determine the magnitude and character of the first force

Take moments with respect to joint 4. Since each halt of the truss forms a 3-4-5 right tri-
angle, d = 20(3/5) = 12 ft (3.7 m), SM4 = 19(20) - 6(10) + UBK = O, andBK=-26.7 kips
(-118.SkN).
The negative result signifies that the assumed direction of BK is incorrect; the force is,
therefore, compressive.

3. Use an alternative solution

Alternatively, resolve BK (again assumed tensile) into its horizontal and vertical compo-
nents at joint 1. Take moments with respect to joint 4. (A force may be resolved into its
components at any point on its action line.) Then, 2M4 = 19(20) + 2OBK7 = -16.0 kips
(-71.2 kN); BK = -16.0(5/3) = -26.7 kips (-118.8 kN).

4. Draw a second free-body diagram of the truss

LENGTH OF CABLE CARRYING
KNOWN LOADS

A cable is supported at points P and g (Fig. Sa) and carries two vertical loads, as shown.
If the tension in the cable is restricted to 1800 Ib (8006 N), determine the minimum length
of cable required to carry the loads.

( a) Assumed position of loaded cable

( c) Force diagram

( b) True position of 
FIGURE 8

loaded cable

Calculation Procedure:

1. Sketch the loaded cable

Assume a position of the cable, such as PRSQ (Fig. So). In Fig. 8Z>, locate points P' and
Q', corresponding to P and Q, respectively, in Fig. 8a.

2. Take moments with respect to an assumed point

Assume that the maximum tension of 1800 Ib (8006 N) occurs in segment PR (Fig. 8).
The reaction at P, which is collinear with PR, is therefore 1800 Ib (8006 N). Compote the
true perpendicular distance m from Q to PR by taking moments with respect to Q. Or
^M6 = 180Om - 500(35) - 750(17) = O; m = 16.8 ft (5.1 m). This dimension establishes
the true position of PR.

3. Start the graphical solution of the problem

In Fig. 86, draw a circular arc having Q' as center and a radius of 16.8 ft (5.1 m). Draw a
line through P' tangent to this arc. Locate R' on this tangent at a horizontal distance of
15 ft (4.6 m) from P'.

4. Draw the force vectors

In Fig. Sc, draw vectors ab, be, and cd to represent the 750-lb (3336-N) load, the 500-lb
(2224-N) load, and the 1800-lb (8006-N) reaction at P, respectively. Complete the trian-
gle by drawing vector da, which represents the reaction at Q.

5. Check the tension assumption

Scale da to ascertain whether it is less than 1800 Ib (8006 N) This is found to be so, and
the assumption that the maximum tension exists in PR is validated.

6. Continue the construction

Draw a line through Q in Fig. Sb parallel to da in Fig. 8c. Locate -S" on this line at a hori-
zontal distance of 17 ft (5.2 m) from Q.

7. Complete the construction

Draw R'S' and db. Test the accuracy of the construction by determining whether these
lines are parallel.

8. Determine the required length of the cable

Obtain the required length of the cable by scaling the lengths of the segments to Fig. 8Z?.
Thus P'R' = 17.1 ft (5.2 m); R'S' = 18.4 ft (5.6 m); S'Q' = 17.6 ft (5.4 m); and length of
cable= 5 3 . l ft (16.2m).

PARABOLIC CABLE TENSION AND LENGTH

A suspension bridge has a span of 960 ft (292.61 m) and a sag of 50 ft (15.2 m). Each ca-
ble carries a load of 1.2 kips per linear foot (kips/lin ft) (17,512.68 N/m) uniformly dis-
tributed along the horizontal. Compute the tension in the cable at midspan and at the sup-
ports, and determine the length of the cable.

Calculation Procedure:

1. Compute the tension at midspan

A cable carrying a load uniformly distributed along the horizontal assumes the form of a
parabolic arc. In Fig. 9, which shows such a cable having supports at the same level, the
tension at midspan is H= wL2/(8d), where H = midspan tension, kips (kN); w = load on a
unit horizontal distance, kips/lin ft (kN/m); L = span, ft (m); d = sag, ft (m). Substituting
yields H= 1.2(960)2/[8(50)] = 2765 kips (12,229 kN).

Unit 

load = w

FIGURE 9 Cable supporting load uniformly distributed along horizontal.

2. Compute the tension at the supports

Use the relation T=[H2 + (wL/2)2]05, where T= tension at supports, kips (kN), and the
other symbols are as before. Thus, T= [(27652 + (1.2 x 48O2]0-5 = 2824 kips (12,561 kN).

3. Compute the length of the cable

When dlL is 1/20 or less, the cable length can be approximated from S = L + 8</2/(3L),
where S = cable length, ft (m). Thus, S = 960 + 8(50)2/[3(960)] = 966.94 ft (294.72 m).

CATENARY CABLE SAG AND DISTANCE
BETWEEN SUPPORTS

A cable 500 ft (152.4 m) long and weighing 3 pounds per linear foot (Ib/lin ft) (43.8
N/m) is supported at two points lying in the same horizontal plane. If the tension at the
supports is 1800 Ib (8006 N), find the sag of the cable and the distance between the
supports.

Calculation Procedure:

1. Compute the catenary parameter

A cable of uniform cross section carrying only its own weight assumes the form of a cate-
nary. Using the notation of the previous procedure, we find the catenary parameter c from
d+C = TJw= 1800/3 = 600 ft (182.9 m). Then c = [(d + c)2 - (S/2)2]0 5 = [(60O)2]0 5 -
(25O)2]05 = 545.4 ft (166.2m).

2. Compute the cable sag

Since d + c = 600 ft (182.9 m) and c = 545.4 ft (166.2 m), we know d= 600 - 545.4 = 54.6
ft (16.6 m).

3. Compute the span length

Use the relation L = 2c In (d + c + 0.55)/c, or L = 2(545.5) In (600 + 250) 545.4 = 484.3 ft
(147.6 m).

STABILITY OFA RETAINING WALL

Determine the factor of safety (FS) against sliding and overturning of the concrete retain-
ing wall in Fig 10. The concrete weighs 150 lb/ft3 (23.56 kN/m3, the earth weighs 100
lb/ft3 (15.71 kN/m3), the coefficient of friction is 0.6, and the coefficient of active earth
pressure is 0.333.

Calculation Procedure:

1. Compute the vertical loads on the wall

Select a 1-ft (304.8-mm) length of wall as typical of the entire structure. The horizontal
pressure of the confined soil varies linearly with the depth and is represented by the trian-
gle BGF in Fig. 10
Resolve the wall into the elements AECD and AEB; pass the vertical plane BF through
the soil. Calculate the vertical loads, and locate their resultants with respect to the toe C.

Thus W1 = 15(I)(ISO) = 2250 Ib (10,008
N); W2 = 0.5(15)(5)(150) = 5625; W3 =
0.5(15XS)(IOO) = 3750. Then ^W =
11,625 Ib (51,708 N). Also, Jc1 = 0.5 ft; X2
= 1 + 0333(5) = 2.67 ft (0.81 m); Jc3 = 1 +
0.667(5)-433 ft (1.32m).

2. Compute the resultant
horizontal soil thrust

Compute the resultant horizontal thrust T
Ib of the soil by applying the coefficient
of active earth pressure. Determine the
location of T. Thus BG = 0.333(1S)(IOO)
= 500 Ib/lin ft (7295 N/m); T =
0.5(15)(500) = 3750 Ib (16,680 N); y =
0.333(15) = 5 ft (1.5m).

3. Compute the maximum
frictional force preventing
sliding

The maximum frictional force Fm =
!*& ^' wnere M = coefficient of friction.
Or Fm = 0.6(11,625) - 6975 Ib (31,024.8
N).

FICURE 10 

4. Determine the factor of safety against sliding

The factor of safety against sliding is FSS = FJT = 6975/3750 = 1.86.

5. Compute the moment of the overturning and stabilizing forces

Taking moments with respect to C, we find the overturning moment = 3750(5) = 18,750
lb-ft (25,406.3 N-m). Likewise, the stabilizing moment = 2250(0.5) + 5625(2.67) +
3750(4.33) = 32,375 lb-ft (43,868.1 N-m).

6. Compute the factor of safety against overturning

The factor of safely against overturning is FSO = stabilizing moment, lb-ft (N-m)/over-
turning moment. lb-ft (N-m) = 32,375/18,750 = 1.73.

ANALYSIS OF A SIMPLE SPACE TRUSS

In the space truss shown in Fig. 1 Ia, A lies in the xy plane, B and C lie on the z axis, and
D lies on the x axis. A horizontal load of 4000 Ib (17,792 N) lying in the xy plane is ap-
plied at A. Determine the force induced in each member by applying the method of joints,
and verify the results by taking moments with respect to convenient axes.

Calculation Procedure:

1. Determine the projected length of members

Let dX9 dy and dz denote the length of a member as projected on the jc, y, and x axes, re-
spectively. Record in Table 3 the projected lengths of each member. Record the remain-
ing values as they are obtained.

(o) Isometric view of spoce truss 

(b) V iew normol to yz plane

FIGURE 11

2. Compute the true length of each member

Use the equation d = (d% + d* + dz

2)0 5, where d = the true length of a member.

3. Compute the ratio of the projected length to the true length

For each member, compute the ratios of the three projected lengths to the true length. For
example, for member AC, dzld = 6/12.04 = 0.498.
These ratios are termed direction cosines because each represents the cosine of the an-
gle between the member and the designated axis, or an axis parallel thereto.
Since the axial force in each member has the same direction as the member itself, a di-
rection cosine also represents the ratio of the component of a force along the designated
axis to the total force in the member. For instance, let AC denote the force in member AC,
and let ACx denote its component along the x axis. ThQnACxIAC = dx/d = 0.249.

4. Determine the component forces

Consider joint A as a free body, and assume that the forces in the three truss members are

tensile. Equate the sum of the forces along each axis to zero. For instance, if the truss
members are in tension, the x components of these forces are directed to the left, and ^Fx
= 4000 -ABx -ACx -ADx = O.
Express each component in terms of the total force to obtain ^Fx = 4000 - 0.26&45 -
0.249^C - 0.707'AD = O; 2Fy = -0.894,45 - 0 .83IAC - 0.707'AD = O; 2FZ = 0.358,45
-0.498,4C = O.

5. Solve the simultaneous equations in step 4 to evaluate the
forces in the truss members

A positive result in the solution signifies tension; a negative result, compression. Thus,
AB = 3830-lb (17,036-N) compression; AC = 2750-lb (12,232-N) compression; and AD =
8080-lb (35,940-N) tension. To verify these results, it is necessary to select moment axes
yielding equations independent of those previously developed.

6. Resolve the reactions into their components

In Fig. 1 Ib, show the reactions at the supports B, C, and D, each reaction being numeri-
cally equal to and collinear with the force in the member at that support. Resolve these re-
actions into their components.

7. Take moments about a selected axis

Take moments with respect to the axis through C parallel to the x axis. (Since the x com-
ponents of the forces are parallel to this axis, their moments are zero.) Then 2MCjc =
IQABy - 6ADy = 10(0.894)(3830) - 6(0.707)(8080) = O.

8. Take moments about another axis

Take moments with respect to the axis through D parallel to the x axis. So ^M0x = 4ABy —
6ACy = 4(0.894)(3830) - 6(0.831)(2750) = O.
The computed results are thus substantiated.

ANALYSIS OFA COMPOUND SPACE TRUSS

The compound space truss in Fig. Via has the dimensions shown in the orthographic pro-
jections, Fig. I2b and c. A load of 5000 Ib (22,240 N), which lies in the xy plane and
makes an angle of 30° with the vertical, is applied at A. Determine the force induced in
each member, and verify the results.

Calculation Procedure:

1. Compute the true length of each truss member

Since the truss and load system are symmetric with respect to the xy plane, the internal
forces are also symmetric. As one component of an internal force becomes known, it will
be convenient to calculate the other components at once, as well as the total force.
Record in Table 4 the length of each member as projected on the coordinate axes. Cal-
culate the true length of each member, using geometric relations.

2. Resolve the applied load into Its x and y components

Use only the absolute values of the forces. Thus Px = 5000 sin 30° = 2500 Ib (11,120 N);
Py = 5000 cos 30° = 4330 Ib (19,260 N).

3. Compute the horizontal reactions

Compute the horizontal reactions at D and at line CC (Fig. 126). Thus 2MCC = 4330(12)
- 2500(7) - 10//! = O; H1 = 3446 Ib (15,328 N); H2 = 3446 - 2500 = 946 Ib (4208 N).

4. Compute the vertical reactions

Consider the equilibrium of joint D and the entire truss when you are computing the verti-
cal reactions. In all instances, assume that an unknown internal force is tensile. Thus, at
joint D: ^Fx = -H1 + 2BDx = O; BDx = 1723-lb (7664-N) tension; BDy = 1723(10/12) =
1436 Ib (6387 N); likewise, ^Fy = V1 - 2BDy = V1 - 2(1436) - O; F1 - 2872 Ib (12,275 N).
For the entire truss, 2Fy = V1 + V2 - 4330 = O; V2 = 1458 Ib (6485 N).
The z components of the reactions are not required in this solution. Thus, the remain-
ing calculations for BD are BD2 = 1723(4/12) = 574 Ib (2553 N); BD = 1723(16.12/12) =
2315 Ib (10,297 N).

5. Compute the unknown forces by using the equilibrium of a joint

Calculate the forces AC and BC by considering the equilibrium of joint C. Thus ^Fx =
0.5H2 + ACx + BC=Q, Eq. a; 2Fy = 0.5F2 - ACy = O, Eq. b. From Eq. b, ACy = 729-lb
(3243-N) tension. Then ACx = 729(12/7) = 1250 Ib (5660 N). From Eq. a, BC = 1723-lb
(7664-N) compression. Then AC2 = 729(4/7) = 417 Ib (1855 N); AC = 729(14.46/7) =
1506 Ib (6699 N).

6. Compute another set of forces by considering joint equilibrium

Calculate the forces AB and BB' by considering the equilibrium of joint B. Thus ^Fy =
BDy - ABy = O; ABy = 1436-lb (6387-N) tension; AB2 = 1436(4/7) = 821 Ib (3652 N); AB =
1436 (8.06/7) - 1653 Ib (7353 N); 2FZ = -AB2 - BD2 - BB' = O; BB' = 1395-lb (6205-N)
compression.
All the internal forces are now determined. Show in Table 4 the tensile forces as posi-
tive, and the compressive forces as negative.

7. Check the equilibrium of the first joint considered

The first joint considered was A. Thus ^Fx = -2ACx + 2500 =-2(1250) + 2500 = O, and
^Fy = 2ABy + 2ACy - 4330 = 2(1436) + 2(729) - 4330 = O. Since the summation offerees
for both axes is zero, the joint is in equilibrium.

8. Check the equilibrium of the second joint

Check the equilibrium of joint B by taking moments of the forces acting on this joint with
respect to the axis through A parallel to the x axis (Fig. 12c). Thus %MAx = -IBB' + IBD2
+ 4BDy = -7(1395) + 7(574) + 4(1436) = O.

9. Check the equilibrium of the right-hand part of the structure

Cut the truss along a plane parallel to the yz plane. Check the equilibrium of the right-
hand part of the structure. Now ^Fx = -2BDx + 2BC-2ACx + 2500 = -2(1723) + 2(1723)
- 2(1250) + 2500 - O, and ^Fy = 2BDy + 2ACy - 4330 = 2(1436) + 2(729) - 4330 = O. The
calculated results are thus substantiated in these equations.

GEOMETRIC PROPERTIES OF AN AREA

Calculate the polar moment of inertia of the area in Fig. 13: (a) with respect to its cen-
troid, and (b) with respect to point A.

Calculation Procedure:

1. Establish the area axes

Set up the horizontal and vertical coordinate axes u and y, respectively.

2. Divide the area into suitable elements

Using the American Institute of Steel Construction (AISC) Manual, obtain the properties
of elements 1, 2, and 3 (Fig. 13) after locating the horizontal centroidal axis of each ele-
ment. Thusy1 = 2/3(6) - 4 in (101.6 mm); y2 = 2 in (50.8 mm); y3 = 0.424(8) = 3.4 in (86.4
mm).

3. Locate the horizontal centroidal axis of the entire area

Let jc denote the horizontal centroidal axis of the entire area. Locate this axis by comput-
ing the statical moment of the area with respect to the u axis. Thus

Then^m = 2051/212.5 = 9.7 in (246 A mm). Since the area is symmetric with respect to
the y axis, this is also a centroidal axis. The intersection point G of the ;c and y axes is,
therefore, the centroid of the area.

3. Compute the distance between the centroidal axis and the
reference axis

Compute k, the distance between the horizontal centroidal axis of each element and the x
axis. Only absolute values are required. Thus Ar1 = 9.7 - 4.0 = 5.7 in (1448 mm); k2 = 9.7 -
8.0 = 1.7 in (43.2 mm); k3 = 13.4 - 9.7 = 3.7 in (94.0 mm).

5. Compute the moment of inertia of the entire area—x axis

Let /o denote the moment of inertia of an element with respect to its horizontal centroidal
axis and A its area. Compute the moment of inertia Ix of the entire area with respect to the
jc axis by applying the transfer equation Ix 2/0 + ^AK2. Thus

3121(12.99)

Then, Ix = 632 + 3121 = 3753 in4 (15.62 dm4).

6. Determine the moment of inertia of the entire area —y axis

For this computation, subdivide element 1 into two triangles having the y axis as a base.

7. Compute the polar moment of inertia of the area

Apply the equation for the polar moment of inertia J0 with respect to G: JG = Ix + Iy =
3753 + 3484 = 7237 in4 (30.12 dm4).

8. Determine the moment of inertia of the entire area —w axis

Apply the equation in step 5 to determine the moment of inertia Iw of the entire area with
respect to the horizontal axis w through A. Thus k= 15.0 - 9.7 = 5.3 in (134.6 mm); Iw =
1, + AJc1 = 3753 + 212.5(5.3)2 = 9722 in4 (40.46 dm4).

9. Compute the polar moment of inertia

Compute the polar moment of inertia of the entire area with respect to A. Then JA=Iw + Iy
= 9722 ± 3484 = 13,206 in4 (54.97 dm4).

PRODUCT OF INERTIA OF AN AREA

Calculate the product of inertia of the isosceles trapezoid in Fig. 14 with respect to the
rectangular axes u and v.

Calculation Procedure:

1. Locate the centroid of
the trapezoid

Using the AISC Manual or another
suitable reference, we find h = cen-
troid distance from the axis (Fig. 14)
= (9/3)[(2 x 5 + 10)/(5 + 1O)] = 4 in
(101.6mm).

2. Compute the area and
product of inertia Pxy

The area of the trapezoid is A =
l/'(9)(5 + 10) = 67.5 in2 (435.5 cm2).
Since the area is symmetrically dis-
posed with respect to the y axis, the
product of inertia with respect to the
x andy axes is P^ = O.

FIGURE 14 

3. Compute the product of inertia by applying the transfer
equation

The transfer equation for the product of inertia is Puv = P^ + Axmym, where xm and ym are
the coordinates of O' with respect to the centroidal x and y axes, respectively. Thus Puv =•
O + 67.5(-5)(-4) = 1350 in4 (5.6 dm4).

PROPERTIES OF AN AREA WITH RESPECT
TO ROTATED AXES

In Fig 15, x and y are rectangular axes through the centroid of the isosceles triangle; x'
and y' are axes parallel to x and y, respectively; jc"and>>"are axes making an angle of 30°
with jc' and y', respectively. Compute the moments of inertia and the product of inertia of
the triangle with respect to the x" and y" axes.

Calculation Procedure:

1. Compute the area of the figure

The area of this triangle = 0.5(base)(altirude) = 0.5(8)(9) = 36 in2 (232.3 cm2).

2. Compute the properties of the area with respect to the
x and y axes

Using conventional moment-of-inertia relations, we find Ix = bcP/3>6 = 8(9)3/36 = 162 in4
(0.67 dm4); Iy = b3d/4$ = (8)3(9)748 = 96 in4 (0.39 dm4). By symmetry, the product of in-
ertia with respect to the x and y axes is P^ = O.

FIGURE 15

3. Compute the properties of the area with respect to the
x' and y'axes

Using the usual moment-of-inertia relations, we find Ix, = Ix + Ay 2
m = 162 + 36(6)2 = 1458
in4 (6.06 dm4); /,/ = /., + Ax2
m = 96 + 36(7)2 = 1660 in4 (7.74 dm4); Px,y, = P^ + Axmym = O
+ 36(7)(6) = 1512 in4 (6.29 dm4).

4. Compute the properties of the area with respect to the
x" and y" axes

For the x" axis, /^ = Ix, COS2O + Iy, sin20 - Px,y, sin 20 = 1458(0.75) + 1860(0.25) -
1512(0.866) = 249 in4 (1.03 dm4).
For the /'axis, Iy.= Ix, sin20 + Iy, cos28 + Px,y, sin 20 = 1458(0.25) + 1860(0.75) +
1512(0.866) = 3069 in4 (12.77 dm4).
The product of inertia is Pxy=Px,y, cos 20+ [(Ix>-Iy)l2} sin20= 1512(0.5)+ 1(1458
- 1860)/2]0.866 = 582 in4 (2.42 dm4).

Analysis of Stress and Strain

The notational system for axial stress and strain used in this section is as follows: A =
cross-sectional area of a member; L = original length of the member; A/ = increase in
length; P = axial force; s = axial stress; e = axial strain = A//L; E = modulus of elasticity
of material = sle. The units used for each of these factors are given in the calculation pro-
cedure. In all instances, it is assumed that the induced stress is below the proportional lim-
it. The basic stress and elongation equations used are s = PIA; A/ = sLIE = PLI(AE). For
steel, E = 30 x 106 lb/in2 (206 GPa).

STRESS CAUSED BYAN AXIAL LOAD

A concentric load of 20,000 Ib (88,960 N) is applied to a hanger having a cross-sectional
area of 1.6 in2 (1032.3 mm2). What is the axial stress in the hanger?

Calculation Procedure:

1. Compute the axial stress

Use the general stress relation S = PIA = 20,000/1.6 = 12,500 lb/in2 (86,187.5 kPa).
Related Calculations: Use this general stress relation for a member of any
cross-sectional shape, provided the area of the member can be computed and the member
is made of only one material.

DEFORMATION CAUSED BYAN
AXIALLOAD

A member having a length of 16 ft (4.9 m) and a cross-sectional area of 2.4 in2 (1548.4
mm2) is subjected to a tensile force of 30,000 Ib (133.4 kN). IfE = 15 x 106 lb/in2 (103
GPa), how much does this member elongate?

Calculation Procedure:

1. Apply the general deformation equation

The general deformation equation is A/ = PLI(AE) = 30,000(16)(12)/[2.4(15 x 106)1 =
0.16 in (4.06 mm).
Related Calculations: Use this general deformation equation for any material
whose modulus of elasticity is known. For composite materials, this equation must be al-
tered before it can be used.

DEFORMATION OFA BUILT-UP MEMBER

A member is built up of three bars placed end to end, the bars having the lengths and
cross-sectional areas shown in Fig. 16. The member is placed between two rigid surfaces
and axial loads of 30 kips (133 kN) and 10 kips (44 kN) are applied at A and B, respec-
tively. If E = 2000 kips/in2 (13,788 MPa), determine the horizontal displacement of A and
B.

Calculation Procedure:

1. Express the axial force in terms of one reaction

Let RL and RR denote the reactions at the left and right ends, respectively. Assume that
both reactions are directed to the left. Consider a tensile force as positive and a compres-
sive force as negative. Consider a deformation positive if the body elongates and negative
if the body contracts.

A r e a, in2

FIGURE 16

Express the axial force P in each bar in terms of R1 because both reactions are as-
sumed to be directed toward the left. Use subscripts corresponding to the bar numbers
(Fig. 16). Thus, P1=R1P2 = - 30; P3=R1- 40.

2. Express the deformation of each bar in terms of the reaction
and modulus of elasticity

Thus, A/! = RL(16)/(2.QE) = 18RL/E; M2 = (R1 - 30)(48)/(1.6£) = (3QRL - 900)/£; A/3 =
(RL -4Q)24/(l.2E) = (2QRL - 800)/£.

3. Solve for the reaction

Since the ends of the member are stationary, equate the total deformation to zero, and
solve for R1. Thus A/, = (68RL - 1700)/£ = O; RL = 25 kips (111 kN). The positive result
confirms the assumption that RL is directed to the left.

4. Compute the displacement of the points

Substitute the computed value ofRL in the first two equations of step 2 and solve for the
displacement of the points A and B. Thus AZ1 = 18(25)72000 = 0.225 in (5.715 mm); A/2 =
[30(25) - 900]/2000 = -0.075 in (-1.905 mm).
Combining these results, we find the displacement of A = 0.225 in (5.715 mm) to the
right; the displacement of B = 0.225 - 0.075 = 0.150 in (3.81 mm) to the right.

5. Verify the computed results

To verify this result, compute RR and determine the deformation of bar 3. Thus H*FH =
- R1 + 30 + 10 - RR = O; RR = 15 kips (67 kN). Since bar 3 is in compression,
AZ3 = -15(24)/[1.2(2000)] = -0.150 in (-3.81 mm). Therefore, B is displaced 0.150 in
(3.81 mm) to the right. This verifies the result obtained in step 4.

REACTIONS AT ELASTIC SUPPORTS

The rigid bar in Fig. YIa is subjected to a load of 20,000 Ib (88,960 N) applied at D, It is
supported by three steel rods, 1, 2, and 3 (Fig. 17a). These rods have the following rela-
tive cross-sectional areas: A1 = 1.25, A2 = 1.20, A3 = 1.00. Determine the tension in each
rod caused by this load, and locate the center of rotation of the bar.

Calculation Procedure:

1. Draw/ a free-body diagram; apply the equations of equilibrium

Draw the free-body diagram (Fig. 176) of the bar. Apply the equations of equilibrium:

Assumed center
of rotation

• I n i t i al position
De f le c ted position

FIGURE 17

^F7P1 +P2+ P3- 20,000 = O, or P1+P2+ P3 = 20,000, Eq. a; also, ^Mc = 16P1 + 1OP2
- 20,000(12) = O, or 16P1 + 1OP2 = 240,000, Eq. b.

2. Establish the relations between the deformations

Selecting an arbitrary center of rotation O9 show the bar in its deflected position (Fig.
lie). Establish the relationships among the three deformations. Thus, by similar triangles,
(AZ1 - A/2)/(A/2 - A/3) = 6/10, or 1OA/! - 16A/2 + 6A/3 = O, Eq. c.

3. Transform the deformation equation to an axial-force equation

By substituting axial-force relations in Eq. c, the following equation is obtained:
10Pi(5)/(1.25£) - 16P2(9)/(1.20E) + 6P3(I.S)IE = O, or 40Pi - 12OP2 + 45P3 = O, Eq. c'.

4. Solve the simultaneous equations developed

Solve the simultaneous equations a, b, and c' to obtain PI = 11,810 Ib (52,530 N); P2 =
5100 Ib (22,684 N); P3 = 3090 Ib (13,744 N).

5. Locate the center of rotation

To locate the center of rotation, compute the relative deformation of rods 1 and 2. Thus
A/! = 11,810(5)/(1.25£) = 47,240/£; A/2 = 5100(9)7(1.2OF) = 38,250/£.'
In Fig. 17c, by similar triangles, x/(x - 6) = A/!/A/2 = 1.235; x = 31.5 ft (9.6 m).

6. Verify the computed values of the tensile forces

Calculate the moment with respect to A of the applied and resisting forces. Thus MAa =
20,000(4) - 80,000 lb-ft (108,400 N-m); MAr = 5100(6) + 3090(16) = 80,000 
lb-ft
(108,400 N-m). Since the moments are equal, the results are verified.

ANALYSIS OF CABLE SUPPORTING
A CONCENTRATED LOAD

A cold-drawn steel wire % in (6.35 mm) in diameter is stretched tightly between two
points lying on the same horizontal plane 80 ft (24.4 m) apart. The stress in the wire is

FIGURE 18

50,000 lb/in2 (344,700 kPa). A load of 200
Ib (889.6 N) is suspended at the center of
the cable. Determine the sag of the cable
and the final stress in the cable. Verify that
the results obtained are compatible.

Calculation Procedure:

1. Derive the stress and strain
relations for the cable

With reference to Fig. 18,Z = distance between supports, ft (m); P = load applied at cen-
ter of cable span, Ib (N); d = deflection of cable center, ft (m); e = strain of cable caused
by P; S1 and S2 = initial and final tensile stress in cable, respectively, lb/in2 (kPa).
Refer to the geometry of the deflection diagram. Taking into account that dlL is ex-
tremely small, derive the following approximations: S2
 = PL/(4Ad), Eq. a; e = 2(d/L)2, Eq.
b.
2. Relate stress and strain

Express the increase in stress caused by P in terms of e, and apply the above two equa-
tions to derive 2E(dlLf + s^dlL) = P/(4A), Eq. c.

3. Compute the deflection at the center of the cable

Using Eq. c, we get 2(30)(10)6(d/I)3 + 50,000^/1 = 200/[4(0.049)], so dlL = 0.0157 and /.
d= 0.0157(80) = 1.256 ft (0.382 m).

4. Compute the final tensile stress

Write Eq. a as S2 = [P/(4A)]/(d/L) = 1020/0.0157 = 65,000 lb/in2 (448,110 kPa).

5. Verify the results computed

To demonstrate that the results are compatible, accept the computed value of dlL as cor-
rect. Then apply Eq. b to find the strain, and compute the corresponding stress. Thus e =
2(0.0157)2 - 4.93 x IQ-4; S2 = S1 + Ee = 50,000 + 30 x 106 x 4.93 x 10^ = 64,800 lb/in2
(446,731 kPa). This agrees closely with the previously calculated stress of 65,000 lb/in2
(448,11OkPa).

DISPLACEMENT OF TRUSS JOINT

In Fig. 19a, the steel members AC and BC both have a cross-sectional area of 1.2 in2 (7.7
cm2). If a load of 20 kips (89.0 IcN) is suspended at C, how much is joint C displaced?

Calculation Procedure:

1. Compute the length of each member and the tensile forces

Consider joint C as a free body to find the tensile force in each member. Thus LAC =192
in (487.7 cm); LBC= 169.7 in (431.0 cm); PAC= 14,640 Ib (65,118.7 N); PBC= 17,930 Ib
(79,752.6 N).

2. Determine the elongation of each member

Use the relation A/ = PLI(AE). Thus MAC = 14,640(192)/[1.2(30 x 106)] = 0.0781 in
(1.983 mm); MBC= 17,930(169.7)/[1.2(30 x 106)] - 0.0845 in (2.146 mm).

3. Construct the Williott displacement diagram

Selecting a suitable scale, construct the Williott displacement diagram as follows: Draw

( a) Space diagram

FIGURE 19

( b) Displacement diagram

(Fig. 196) line Ca parallel to member AC, with Ca = 0.0781 in (1.98 mm). Similarly,
draw Cb parallel to member BC, with Cb = 0.0845 in (2.146 mm).

4. Determine the displacement

Erect perpendiculars to Ca and Cb at a and 6, respectively. Designate the intersection
point of these perpendiculars as C'.
Line CC represents, in both magnitude and direction, the approximate displacement
of joint C under the applied load. Scaling distance CC to obtain the displacement shows
that the displacement of C = 0.134 in (3.4036 mm).

AXIAL STRESS CAUSED BY IMPACT LOAD

A body weighing 18 Ib (80.1 N) falls 3 ft (0.9 m) before contacting the end of a vertical
steel rod. The rod is 5 ft (1.5 m) long and has a cross-sectional area of 1.2 in2 (7.74 cm2).
If the entire kinetic energy of the falling body is absorbed by the rod, determine the stress
induced in the rod.

Calculation Procedure:

1. State the equation for the induced stress

Equate the energy imparted to the rod to the potential energy lost by the falling body:
s = (P/A) {1 + [1 + 2EhI(LPIA)]*-5), where h = vertical displacement of body, ft (m).

2. Substitute the numerical values

Thus, PIA = 18/1.2 = 15 lb/in2 (103 kPa); h = 3 ft (0.9 m); L = 5 ft (1.5 m); 2EhI(LPIA) =
2(30) x 106)(3)/[5(15)] = 2,400,000. Then s = 23,250 lb/in2 (160,285.5 kPa).
Related Calculations: Where the deformation of the supporting member is neg-
ligible in relation to the distance h, as it is in the present instance, the following approxi-
mation is used: s = [2PEh/(AL)]°-5.

STRESSES ON AN OBLIQUE PLANE

A prism ABCD in Fig. 2Oa has the principal stresses of 6300- and 2400-lb/in2 (43,438.5-
and 16,548.0-kPa) tension. Applying both the analytical and graphical methods, deter-
mine the normal and shearing stress on plane AE.

Calculation Procedure:

1. Compute the stresses, using the analytical method

A principal stress is a normal stress not accompanied by a shearing stress. The plane on
which the principal stress exists is termed a principal plane. For a condition of plane
stress, there are two principal planes through every point in a stressed body and these
planes are mutually perpendicular. Moreover, one principal stress is the maximum normal
stress existing at that point; the other is the minimum normal stress.
Let sx and sy = the principal stress in the x and y direction, respectively; Sn = normal
stress on the plane making an angle 6 with the y axis; ss = shearing stress on this plane.
All stresses are expressed in pounds per square inch (kilopascals) and all angles in de-
grees. Tensile stresses are positive; compressive stresses are negative.
Applying the usual stress equations yields sn = sy + (sx - sy) cos2 0; ss = l/2(sx - sy)
sin 20. Substituting gives sn = 2400 + (6300 - 2400)0.7662 = 4690-lb/in2 (32,337.6-kPa)
tension, and ss = '/2(63OO - 2400)0.985 = 1920 lb/in2 (13,238.4 kPa).

2. Apply the graphical method of solution

Construct, in Fig. 2Qb, Mohr's circle of stress thus: Using a suitable scale, draw OA = sy9
and OB = sx. Draw a circle having AB as its diameter. Draw the radius CD making an an-
gle of 26 = 80° with AB. Through D9 drop a perpendicular DE to AB. Then OE = Sn and
ED = ss. Scale OE and ED to obtain the normal and shearing stresses on plane AE.
Related Calculations: The normal stress may also be computed from sn =
(sx + 5^)0.5 + (sx - Sy)0.5 cos 29.

EVALUATION OF PRINCIPAL STRESSES

The prism ABCD in Fig. 2Ia is subjected to the normal and shearing stresses shown. Con-
struct Mohr's circle to determine the principal stresses at A, and locate the principal
planes.

Calculation Procedure:

1. Draw the lines representing the normal stresses (Fig. 21b)

Through the origin O, draw a horizontal base line. Locate points E and F such that OE =
8400 lb/in2 (57,918.0 kPa) and OF = 2000 lb/in2 (13,790.0 kPa). Since both normal
stresses are tensile, E and F lie to the right of O. Note that the construction required here
is the converse of that required in the previous calculation procedure.

2. Draw the lines representing the shearing stresses

Construct the vertical lines EG and FH such that EG = 3600 lb/in2 (24,822.0 kPa), and
FH = -3600 lb/in2 (-24,822.0 kPa).

3. Continue the construction

Draw line GH to intersect the base line at C.

4. Construct Mohr's circle

Draw a circle having GH as diameter, intersecting the base line at A and B. Then lines OA
and OB represent the principal stresses.

( b) Mohr's c irc le of stress

( o) Stresses on prism

FIGURE 21

( c) Free -body diagram of AOJ

5. Scale the diagram

Scale OA and OB to obtain/max = 10,020 lb/in2 (69,087.9 kPa);/min = 380 lb/in2 (2620.1
kPa). Both stresses are tension.

6. Determine the stress angle

Scale angle BCG and measure it as 48 °22'. The angle between the x axis, on which the
maximum stress exists, and the side AD of the prism is one-half of BCG.

7. Construct the x and y axes

In Fig. 2Ia, draw the x axis, making a counterclockwise angle of 24011' with AD. Draw
the y axis perpendicular thereto.

8. Verify the locations of the principal planes

Consider ADJ as a free body. Set the length AD equal to unity. In Fig. 2I c, since there is
no shearing stress on AJ, %FH = T cos 6 - 8400 - 3600 tan O = O; T cos B = 8400 +
3600(0.45) = 10,020 lb/in2 (69,087.9 kPa). The stress on AJ = TIAJ = T cos O = 10,020
lb/in2 (69,087.9 kPa).

HOOP STRESS IN THIN-WALLED CYLINDER
UNDER PRESSURE

A steel pipe 5 ft (1.5 m) in diameter and 3/s in (9.53 mm) thick sustains a fluid pressure of
180 lb/in2 (1241.1 kPa). Determine the hoop stress, the longitudinal stress, and the in-
crease in diameter of this pipe. Use 0.25 for Poisson's ratio.

Calculation Procedure:

1. Compute the hoop stress

Use the relation s = pD/(2i), where s = hoop or tangential stress, lb/in2 (kPa); p = radial
pressure, lb/in2 (kPa); D = internal diameter of cylinder, in (mm); t = cylinder wall thick-
ness, in (mm). Thus, for this cylinder, s = 180(60)/[2(3/8)] = 14,400 lb/in2 (99,288.0 kPa).

2. Compute the longitudinal stress

Use the relation s' =pD/(4t), where s' = longitudinal stress, i.e., the stress parallel to the
longitudinal axis of the cylinder, lb/in2 (kPa), with other symbols as before. Substituting
yields s' = 7200 lb/in2 (49,644.0 kPa).

3. Compute the increase in the cylinder diameter

Use the relation AD = (D/E)(s -

Calculation Procedure:

1. Compute the radial pressure caused by prestressing

Use the relation;? = 2&D/{L>2[l/(taEa) + l/fe£5)]}, where/? = radial pressure resulting
from prestressing, lb/in2 (kPa), with other symbols the same as in the previous calculation
procedure and the subscripts a and s referring to aluminum and steel, respectively. Thus,
p = 2(0.01)/{92[1/(0.5 x l Ox 106) + 1/(0.25 >( 30 x 106)]) = 741 lb/in2 (5109.2 kPa).

2. Compute the corresponding prestresses

Using the subscripts 1 and 2 to denote the stresses caused by prestressing and internal
pressure, respectively, we find sal = pD/(2ta), where the symbols are the same as in the
previous calculation procedure. Thus, sal = 741(9)/[2(0.5)] = 6670-lb/in2 (45,989.7-kPa)
compression. Likewise, ^1 = 741(9)/[2(0.25)] = 13,340-lb/in2 (91,979-kPa) tension.

3. Compute the stresses caused by internal pressure

Use the relation ss2lsa2 = EJEa or, for this cylinder, ss2lsa2 = (30 x 106)/(10 x 106) = 3.
Next, compute sa2 from t^a2 I5S82 = pD/2, or sa2 = 800(9)/[2(0.5 + 0.25 x 3)] = 2880-
lb/in2 (19,857.6-kPa) tension. Also, ss2 = 3(2880) - 8640-lb/in2 (59,572.8-kPa) tension.

4. Compute the final stresses

Sum the results in steps 2 and 3 to obtain the final stresses: sa3 = 6670 - 2880 = 3790-
lb/in2 (26,132.1-kPa) compression; ss3 = 13,340 + 8640 = 21,980-lb/in2 (151,552.1-kPa)

3. Check the accuracy of the results

Use the relation ^r1- s0r2 = [(V2 - ^1X(V2 + r\)](p^1 + p2r2). Substituting the known val-
ues verifies the earlier calculations.

THERMAL STRESS RESULTING FROM
HEATING A MEMBER

A steel member 18 ft (5.5 m) long is set snugly between two walls and heated 8O0F
(44.40C). If each wall yields 0.015 in (0.381 mm), what is the compressive stress in the
member? Use a coefficient of thermal expansion of 6.5 x 10-6/°F (1.17 x 10~5/°C) for
steel.

Calculation Procedure:

1. Compute the thermal expansion of the member without
restraint

Replace the true condition of partial restraint with the following equivalent conditions:
The member is first allowed to expand freely under the temperature rise and is then com-
pressed to its true final length.
To compute the thermal expansion without restraint, use the relation AL = cLkT,
where c - coefficient of thermal expansion, /0F (/0C); AJ = increase in temperature, 0F
(0C); L = original length of member, in (mm); AZ, = increase in length of the member, in
(mm). Substituting gives M = 6.5(10-6XlS)(^)(SO) = 0.1123 in (2.852 mm).

2. Compute the linear restraint exerted by the walls

The walls yield 2(0.015) = 0.030 in (0.762 mm). Thus, the restraint exerted by the walls is
AZ,W = 0.1123 - 0.030 = 0.0823 in (2.090 mm).

3. Determine the compressive stress

Use the relation s = EkLIL, where the symbols are as given earlier. Thus, s =
30(106)(0.0823)/[18(12)] 11,430 lb/in2 (78,809.9 kPa).

length of this bar, and what is the internal force between the steel and copper arising from
a temperature rise of 8O0F (44.40C)? Use the following values for thermal expansion co-

Calculation Procedure:

3. Determine the thermal expansion of the 1-ft (0.3-m) section

c

Using the relation AL - cL№, we get M = 7.2(106)(12)(80) = 0.00691 in (0.17551 mm).

4. Determine the expansion of the first material without restraint

Using the same relation as in step 3 for copper without restraint yields AL
(12)(80) = 0.00864 in (0.219456 mm).

C

5. Compute the restraint of the first material

The copper is restrained to the amount computed in step 3. Thus, the restraint exerted by
the steel is M

THERMAL EFFECTS IN COMPOSITE
MEMBER HAVING ELEMENTS IN SERIES

The aluminum and steel bars in Fig. 23 have cross-sectional areas of 1.2 and 1.0 in2 (7.7
and 6.5 cm2), respectively. The member is restrained against lateral deflection. A temper-
ature rise of 10O0F (550C) causes the length of the member to increase to 42.016 in
(106.720 cm). Determine the stress and deformation of each bar. For aluminum, £ = 10 x
106 c = 13.0 x 10-6; for steel, c = 6.5 x IQ-6.

Calculation Procedure:

1. Express the deformation of each bar resulting from the
temperature change and the compressive force

The temperature rise causes the bar to expand,
whereas the compressive force resists this expan-
sion. Thus, the net expansion is the difference be-
tween these two changes, or ALa = cLAT -
PLf(AE), where the subscript a refers to the alu-
minum bar; the other symbols are the same as
given earlier. Substituting gives AZa = 13.0 x
10^(24)(100)-P(24)/[l.2(10 x 106)] = (31,200-
2P)IO"6, Eq. a. Likewise, for steel: Ms = 6.5 x
10-6(18)(100)-P(18)/[1.0(30x 106)] = (11,700-
0.6P) IO-6, Eq. b.

2. Sum the results in step 1 to obtain
the total deformation of the member

Set the result equal to 0.016 in (0.4064 mm); 
solve for P. Or, AL = (42,900 - 2.6P)IO"6 = 0.016
in (0.4064 mm); P = (42,900 - 16,000)72.6 =
10,350 Ib (46,037 N).

FIGURE 23

3. Determine the stresses and deformation

Substitute the computed value of P in the stress equation 5- = PIA. For aluminum sa =
10,350/1.2 = 8630 lb/in2 (59,503.9 kPa). Then Ma = (31,200 - 2 x 10,35O)IQ-6 = 0.0105
in (0.2667 mm). Likewise, for steel ss = 10,350/1.0 = 10,350 lb/in2 (71,363.3 kPa); and
M8 = (11,700 - 0.6 x 10,350)10~6 = 0.0055 in (0.1397 mm).

SHRINK-FIT STRESS AND RADIAL
PRESSURE

An open steel cylinder having an internal diameter of 4 ft (1.2 m) and a wall thickness of
5/i6 in (7.9 mm) is to be heated to f it over an iron casting. The internal diameter of the
cylinder before heating is Vn in (0.8 mm) less than that of the casting. How much must
the temperature of the cylinder be increased to provide a clearance of VM in (0.8 mm) all
around between the cylinder and casting? If the casting is considered rigid, what stress
will exist in the cylinder after it cools, and what radial pressure will it then exert on the
casting?

Calculation Procedure:

1. Compute the temperature rise required

Use the relation AT = AZ)/(c£>), where Ar = temperature rise required, 0F (0C); AD =
change in cylinder diameter, in (mm); c = coefficient of expansion of the cylinder = 6.5 x
10-6/0F (1.17 x IQ-V0C); D = cylinder internal diameter before heating, in (mm). Thus
AJ- (3/32)/[6.5 x 10-6(48)1 = 30O0F (1670C).

2. Compute the hoop stress in the cylinder

Upon cooling, the cylinder has a diameter Ys2 in (0.8 mm) larger than originally. Compute
the hoop stress from s = EkDID - 3 Ox 1O6CX32)MS = 19,500 lb/in2 (134,452.5 kPa).

3. Compute the associated radial pressure

Use the relationp = 2tsfD, where/? = radial pressure, lb/in2 (kPa), with the other symbols
as given earlier. Thus/? = 2(5/16)(19,500)/48 = 254 lb/in2 (1751.3 kPa).

TORSION OFA CYLINDRICAL SHAFT

A torque of 8000 lb-ft (10,840 N-m) is applied at the ends of a 14-ft (4.3-m) long cylindri-
cal shaft having an external diameter of 5 in (127 mm) and an internal diameter of 3 in
(76.2 mm). What are the maximum shearing stress and the angle of twist of the shaft if the
modulus of rigidity of the shaft is 6 x 106 lb/in2 (4.1 x 104 MPa)?

Calculation Procedure:

1. Compute the polar moment of inertia of the shaft

For a hollow circular shaft, J = (7r/32)(Z)4 - d4), where J = polar moment of inertia of a
transverse section of the shaft with respect to the longitudinal axis, in4 (cm4); D — external
diameter of shaft, in (mm); d - internal diameter of shaft, in (mm). Substituting gives
J= (7T/32)(54 - 34) = 53.4 in4 (2222.6 cm4).

2. Compute the shearing stress in the shaft

Use the relation ss = TRIJ, where ss = shearing stress, lb/in2 (MPa); T = applied torque,
Ib-in (N-m); H = radius of shaft, in (mm). Thus ss = [(8000)(12)(2.5)]/53.4 = 4500 lb/in2
(31,027.5 kPa).

3. Compute the angle of twist of the shaft

Use the relation 6 = TLIJG9 where 6 = angle of twist, rad; L = shaft length, in (mm);
G = modulus of rigidity, lb/in2 (GPa). Thus 0 = (8000)(12)(14)(12)/[53.4(6,000,000)] =
0.050 rad, or 2.9°.

ANALYSIS OFA COMPOUND SHAFT

The compound shaft in Fig. 24 was formed by rigidly joining two solid segments. What
torque may be applied at B if the shearing stress is not to exceed 15,000 lb/in2 (103.4
MPa) in the steel and 10,000 lb/in2 (69.0 MPa) in the bronze? Here G5 = 12 x io6 lb/in2
(82.7 GPa); Gb = 6 x IO6 lb/in2 (41.4 GPa).

Calculation Procedure:

1. Determine the relationship
between the torque in the shaft
segments

Since segments AB and BC (Fig. 24) are
twisted through the same angle, the torque
applied at the junction of these segments is
distributed in proportion to their relative
rigidities. Using the subscripts s and b to 
denote steel and bronze, respectively, we 
see that O = T5LJ(JsG5) = W(J,G,),
where the symbols are as given in the pre-
vious calculation procedure. Solving
yields Ts = (5/4.5)(34/44)( 12/6)7; = 0.703

2. Establish the relationship between the shearing stresses

For steel, sss = 16T5I(TiD3), where the symbols are as given earlier. Thus S55 =
16(0.703F6)/(Tr33). Likewise, for bronze, ssb = 167y(Tr43), /. sss = 0.703(43/33>5* =
1.67*rf.

3. Compute the allowable torque

Ascertain which material limits the capacity of the member, and compute the allowable
torque by solving the shearing-stress equation for T.
If the bronze were stressed to 10,000 lb/in2 (69.0 MPa), inspection of the above rela-
tions shows that the steel would be stressed to 16,700 lb/in2 (115.1 MPa), which exceeds
the allowed 15,000 lb/in2 (103.4 MPa). Hence, the steel limits the capacity. Substituting
the allowed shearing stress of 15,000 lb/in2 (103.4 MPa) gives T5 = 15,000ir(33)/[16(12) =
6630 lb-ft (8984.0 N-m); also, Tb = 6630/0.703 = 9430 lb-ft (12,777.6 N-m). Then T =
6630 + 9430 = 16,060 lb-ft (21,761.3 N-m).

Stresses in Flexural Members

In the analysis of beam action, the general assumption is that the beam is in a horizontal
position and carries vertical loads lying in an axis of symmetry of the transverse section
of the beam.
The vertical shear V at a given section of the beam is the algebraic sum of all vertical
forces to the left of the section, with an upward force being considered positive.
The bending moment M at a given section of the beam is the algebraic sum of the
moments of all forces to the left of the section with respect to that section, a clockwise
moment being considered positive.
If the proportional limit of the beam material is not exceeded, the bending stress (also
called the flexural, or fiber, stress) at a section varies linearly across the depth of the sec-
tion, being zero at the neutral axis. A positive bending moment induces compressive
stresses in the fibers above the neutral axis and tensile stresses in the fibers below. Conse-
quently, the elastic curve of the beam is concave upward where the bending moment is
positive.

6630 + 9430 = 16,060 lb-ft (21,761.3 N-m).

The vertical shear V at a given section of the beam is the algebraic sum of all vertical

SHEAR AND BENDING MOMENT IN A BEAM

Construct the shear and bending-moment diagrams for the beam in Fig. 25. Indicate the
value of the shear and bending moment at all significant sections.

Calculation Procedure:

1. Replace the distributed load on each interval with its equivalent
concentrated load

Where the load is uniformly distributed, this equivalent load acts at the center of the
interval of the beam. Thus WAB = 2(4) = 8 kips (35.6 kN); WBC = 2(6) = 12 kips (53.3 kN);
WAC = 8 + 12 = 20 kips (89.0 kN); WCD = 3(15) = 45 kips (200.1 kN); WDE = 1.4(5) =
7 kips (31. I kN ).

2. Determine the reaction at each support

Take moments with respect to the other support. Thus ^Mn = 25RA - 6(21) - 20(20) -
45(7.5) + 7(2.5) + 4.2(5) = O; SM4 - 6(4) + 20(5) + 45(17.5) + 7(27.5) + 4.2(30) - 25RD
= O. Solving gives RA = 33 kips (146.8 kN); R0 = 49.2 kips (218.84 kN).

3. Verify the computed results and determine the shears

Ascertain that the algebraic sum of the vertical forces is zero. If this is so, the computed
results are correct.
Starting at A9 determine the shear at every significant section, or directly to the left or
right of that section if a concentrated load is present. Thus VA at right = 33 kips (146.8
kN); VB at left = 33 - 8 = 25 kips (111.2 kN); V8 at right = 25 - 6 = 19 kips (84.5 kN); Vc
= 1 9 - 12 = 7 kips (31.1 kN); VD at left = 7 - 45 = -38 kips (-169.0 kN); VD at right =
-38 + 49.2 = 11.2 kips (49.8 kN); VE at left = 11.2 - 7 = 4.2 kips (18.7 kN); VE at right =
4 .2-4 .2 = 0.

4. Plot the shear diagram

Plot the points representing the forces in the previous step in the shear diagram. Since the
loading between the significant sections is uniform, connect these points with straight
lines. In general, the slope of the shear diagram is given by dVldx — —w, where w = unit
load at the given section and x = distance from left end to the given section.

5. Determine the bending moment at every significant section

Starting at A9 determine the bending moment at every significant section. Thus MA = O;
MB = 33(4) - 8(2) = 116 ft-kips (157 kN-m); Mc = 33(10) - 8(8) - 6(6) - 12(3) = 194
ft-kips (263 kN-m). Similarly, M0 = -38.5 ft-kips (-52.2 kN-m); ME = O.

6. Plot the bending-moment diagram

Plot the points representing the values in step 5 in the bending-moment diagram (Fig. 25).
Complete the diagram by applying the slope equation dMIdx = V. where V denotes the
shear at the given section. Since this shear varies linearly between significant sections, the
bending-moment diagram comprises a series of parabolic arcs.

7. Alternatively, apply a moment theorem

Use this theorem: If there are no externally applied moments in an interval 1-2 of the
span, the difference between the bending moments is M2 — = M1 = /f V dx = the area un-
der the shear diagram across the interval.
Calculate the areas under the shear diagram to obtain the following results: M4 = O;
MB = MA + 1/2(4)(33 + 25) = 116 ft-kips (157.3 kN-m); Mc = 116 + 1/2(6)(19 + 7) = 194
ft-kips (263 kN-m); MD = 194 + 1/2(15)(7 - 38) = -38.5 ft-kips (-52.2 kN-m); ME = -38.5 +
1X2(SX 11 .2+ 4.2) = O.

8. Locate the section at which the bending moment is maximum

As a corollary of the equation in step 6, the maximum moment occurs where the shear is
zero or passes through zero under a concentrated load. Therefore, CF = 7/3 = 2.33 ft
(0.71Om).

9. Compute the maximum moment

Using the computed value for CF, we find MF = 194 + !/2(2.33)(7) = 202.2 ft-kips (274.18
kN-m).

BEAM BENDING STRESSES

A beam having the trapezoidal cross section shown in Fig. 26a carries the loads indicated
in Fig. 266. What is the maximum bending stress at the top and at the bottom of this
beam?

(a) Transverse section 
FIGURE 26

(b) Force diagram

Calculation Procedure:

1. Compute the left reaction and the section at which the
shear is zero

The left reaction R1 = 1X2(IO)(SOO) + 1600(2.5/10) = 2900 Ib (12,899.2 N). The section A
at which the shear is zero is x = 2900/500 = 5.8 ft (1.77 m).

2. Compute the maximum moment

Use the relation M4 = ^(290O)(S-S) = 8410 lb-ft (11,395.6 N-m) = 100,900 lb-in
(11,399.682 N-m).

3. Locate the centroidal axis of the section

Use the AISC Manual for properties of the trapezoid. Oryt = (9/3)[(2 * 6 + 3)1(6 + 3)] =
5 in (127 mm); yb = 4m (101.6 mm).

4. Compute the moment of inertia of the section

Using the AISC Manual, I= (93/36)[(62 + 4 x 6 x3 + 32)/(6 + 3)] = 263.3 in4 (10,959.36
cm4).

5. Compute the stresses in the beam

Use the relation/= MyII, where/= bending stress in a given fiber, lb/in2 (kPa); y = dis-
tance from neutral axis to given fiber, in. Thus/op = 100,900(5)/263.3 = 1916-lb/in2
(13,210.8-kPa) compression,/bottom = 100,900(4)/263.3 = 1533-lb/in2 (10,570.0-kPa) ten-
sion.
In general, the maximum bending stress at a section where the moment is M is given
by/= Mc/7, where c = distance from the neutral axis to the outermost fiber, in (mm). For
a section that is symmetric about its centroidal axis, it is convenient to use the section
modulus S of the section, this being defined as S = Uc. Then/= MIS.

ANALYSIS OF A BEAM ON MOVABLE
SUPPORTS

The beam in Fig. 270 rests on two movable supports. It carries a uniform live load of w
Ib/lin ft and a uniform dead load of 0.2w Ib/lin ft. If the allowable bending stresses in ten-
sion and compression are identical, determine the optimal location of the supports.

( a) Loads ca r r ied by overhanging beam

Diagram A Full load on en t i re span
Diagram B Dead load on overhangs; full load
between supports
(b) Bending-moment diagrams

FIGURE 27

Calculation Procedure:

1. Place full load on the overhangs, and compute the
negative moment

Refer to the moment diagrams. For every position of the supports, there is a correspon-
ding maximum bending stress. The position for which this stress has the smallest value
must be identified.
As the supports are moved toward the interior of the beam, the bending moments be-
tween the supports diminish in algebraic value. The optimal position of the supports is
that for which the maximum potential negative moment M1 is numerically equal to the
maximum potential positive moment M2. Thus, M1 = -1.2w(x2/2) = — 0.6w;t2.

2. Place only the dead load on the overhangs and the full load
between the supports. Compute the positive moment.

Sum the areas under the shear diagram to compute M2. Thus, M2 = 1A[1.2w(L/2 - x)2 -
0.2w.r2] = w(0.15L2 - 0.6Lx + 0.5*2).

3. Equate the absolute values of M1 and M2 and solve for x

Substituting gives 0.6*2 = 0.15L2 - 0.6Lx + 0.5*2; x = 110.5°5 - 3) = 0.240L.

FLEXURAL CAPACITY OFA COMPOUND BEAM

A W l6 x 45 steel beam in an existing structure was reinforced by welding an WT6 x 20
to the bottom flange, as in Fig. 28. If the allowable bending stress is 20,000 lb/in2
(137,900 kPa), determine the flexural capacity of the built-up member.

FIGURE 28. Compound beam.

Calculation Procedure:

1. Obtain the properties of the elements

Using the AISC Manual, determine the following properties. For the Wl 6 x 45, d = 16.12
in (409.45 mm); A = 13.24 in2 (85.424 cm2); /= 583 in4 (24,266 cm4). For the WT6 x 20,
d = 5.97 in (151.63 mm); A = 5.89 in2 (38.002 cm2); 1=14 in4 (582.7 cm4); yi = 1.08 in
(27.43 mm); ^2 = 5.97 - 1.08 = 4.89 in (124.21 mm).

2. Locate the centroidal axis of the section

Locate the centroidal axis of the section with respect to the centerline of the W16 x 45,
and compute the distance c from the centroidal axis to the outermost fiber. Thus, ym =
5.89[(8.06 + 4.89)]/(5.89 + 13.24) = 3.99 in (101.346 mm). Then c = 8.06 + 3.99 = 12.05
in (306.07 mm).

3. Find the moment of inertia of the section with respect to its
centroidal axis

Use the relation /0 + AW- for each member, and take the sum for the two members to find /
for the built-up beam. Thus, for the W16 x 45: k = 3.99 in (101.346 mm); 10 + AIf 583 +
13.24(3.99)2 = 793 in4 (33,007.1 cm4). For the WT6 x 20: & = 8.06 - 3.99 + 4.89 = 8.96 in
(227.584 mm); I0 + Ak2 = 14 + 5.89(8.96)2 = 487 in4 (20,270.4 cm4). Then / = 793 + 487
= 1280 in4 (53,277.5 cm4).

4. Apply the moment equation to find the flexural capacity

Use the relation M =fllc = 20,000(1280)/[ 12.05(12)] = 177,000 Ib-ft (240,012 N-m).

ANALYSIS OFA COMPOSITE BEAM

An 8 x 12 in (203.2 x 304.8 mm) timber beam (exact size) is reinforced by the addition
of a 7 x i/2 in (177.8 x 12.7 mm) steel plate at the top and a 7-in (177.8-mm) 9.8-lb
(43.59-N) steel channel at the bottom, as shown in Fig. 29a. The allowable bending
stresses are 22,000 lb/in2 (151,690 kPa) for steel and 1200 lb/in2 (8274 kPa) for timber.
The modulus of elasticity of the timber is 1.2 x io6 lb/in2 (8.274 x io6 kPa). How does
the flexural strength of the reinforced beam compare with that of the original timber
beam?

FIGURE 29

Calculation Procedure:

1. Compute the rigidity of the steel compared with that of the
timber

Let n = the relative rigidity of the steel and timber. Then n = EJE1 = (30 x 106)/(1.2 x IQ6)
= 25.
2. Transform the composite beam to an equivalent
homogeneous beam

To accomplish this transformation, replace the steel with timber. Sketch the cross section
of the transformed beam as in Fig. 29b. Determine the sizes of the hypothetical elements
by retaining the dimensions normal to the axis of bending but multiplying the dimensions
parallel to this axis by n.

3. Record the properties of each element of the
transformed section

Element I: A = 25(T)(1X2) = 87.5 in2 (564.55 cm2); I0 is negligible.
Element 2: A = 8(12) = 96 in2 (619.4 cm2); /0 = !/2(8)123 - 1152 in4 (4.795 dm4).
Element 3: Refer to the AISC Manual for the data; A = 25(2.85) = 71.25 in2 (459.71 cm2);
/o = 25(0.98) = 25 in4 (1040.6 cm4); a = 0.55 in (13.97 mm); b = 2.09 in (53.09 mm).

4. Locate the centroidal axis of the transformed section

Take static moments of the areas with respect to the centerline of the 8 x 12 in (203.2 x
304.8 mm) rectangle. Then j;m = [87.5(6.25) - 71.25(6.55)]/(87.5 + 96 + 71.25) = 0.31 in
(7.87 mm). The neutral axis of the composite section is at the same location as the cen-
troidal axis of the transformed section.

5. Compute the moment of inertia of the transformed section

Apply the relation in step 3 of the previous calculation procedure. Then compute the dis-
tance c to the outermost fiber. Thus, I= 1152 + 25 + 87.5(6.25 - 0.31)2 + 96(0.31)2 +
71.25(6.55 + 0.31)2 = 7626 in4 (31.74 dm4). Also, c = 0.31 + 6 + 2.09 = 8.40 in (213.36
mm).
6. Determine which material limits the beam capacity

Assume that the steel is stressed to capacity, and compute the corresponding stress in the

transformed beam. Thus ,/= 22,000/25 = 880 lb/in2 (6067.6 kPa) < 1200 lb/in2 (8274
kPa).
In the actual beam, the maximum timber stress, which occurs at the back of the chan-
nel, is even less than 880 lb/in2 (6067.6 kPa). Therefore, the strength of the member is
controlled by the allowable stress in the steel.

7. Compare the capacity of the original and reinforced beams

Let subscripts 1 and 2 denote the original and reinforced beams, respectively. Compute
the capacity of these members, and compare the results. Thus M1 -flic = 1200(1152)/6 =
230,000 lb-in (25,985.4 N-m); M2 = 880(7626)/8.40 = 799,000 lb-in (90,271.02 N-m);
M2IM1 = 799,000/230,000 = 3.47. Thus, the reinforced beam is nearly 3V2 times as strong
as the original beam, before reinforcing.

BEAM SHEAR FLOWAND
SHEARING STRESS

A timber beam is formed by securely bolting a 3 x 6 in (76.2 x 152.4 mm) member to a
6 x 8 in (152.4 x 203.2 mm) member (exact size), as shown in Fig. 30. If the beam carries
a uniform load of 600 Ib/lin ft (8.756 kN/m) on a simple span of 13 ft (3.9 m), determine
the longitudinal shear flow and the shearing stress at the juncture of the two elements at a
section 3 ft (0.91 m) from the support.

Calculation Procedure:

1. Compute the vertical shear at the given section

Shear flow is the shearing force acting on a unit distance. In this instance, the shearing
force on an area having the same width as the beam and a length of 1 in (25.4 mm) meas-
ured along the beam span is required.
Using dimensions and data from Fig. 30, we find R = /2(60O)(O) - 3900 Ib (17,347.2
N); V= 3900 - 3(600) = 2100 Ib (9340.8 N).

2. Compute the moment of inertia of the cross section

I= (1Xi2)(W) = (1X^)(I I)3 = 666 in4 (2.772 dm4)

FIGURE 30

3. Determine the static moment of the cross-sectional area

Calculate the static moment Q of the cross-sectional area above the plane under consider-
ation with respect to the centroidal axis of the section. Thus, Q = Ay = 3(6)(4) = 72 in3
(1180.1cm3).

4. Compute the shear flow

Compute the shear flow q, using q = VQfI= 2100(72)7666 = 227 Ib/lin in (39.75 kN/m).

5. Compute the shearing stress

Use the relation v = qlt= VQI(If), where t = width of the cross section at the given plane.
Then v = 227/6 = 38 lb/in2 (262.0 kPa).
Note that v represents both the longitudinal and the transverse shearing stress at a par-
ticular point. This is based on the principle that the shearing stresses at a given point in
two mutually perpendicular directions are equal.

LOCATING THE SHEAR CENTER OFA SECTION

A cantilever beam carries the load shown in Fig. 3 Ia and has the transverse section
shown in Fig. 316. Locate the shear center of the section.

Calculation Procedure:

1. Construct a free-body diagram of a portion of the beam

Consider that the transverse section of a beam is symmetric solely about its horizontal

Thickness

FIGURE 31

( b) Sec t ion X -X

centroidal axis. If bending of the beam is not to be accompanied by torsion, the vertical
shearing force at any section must pass through a particular point on the centroidal axis
designated as the shear, orflexural, center.
Cut the ,beam at section 2, and consider the left portion of the beam as a free body. In
Fig. 3 Ib, indicate the resisting shearing forces K1, K2, and K3 that the right-hand portion of
the beam exerts on the left-hand portion at section 2. Obtain the directions of K1 and K2
this way: Isolate the segment of the beam contained between sections 1 and 2; then isolate
a segment ABDC of the top flange, as shown in Fig. 3 Ic. Since the bending stresses at
section 2 exceed those at section 1, the resultant tensile force T2 exceeds T1. The resisting
force on CD is therefore directed to the left. From the equation of equilibrium SM = O it
follows that the resisting shears on AC and BD have the indicated direction to constitute a
clockwise couple.
This analysis also reveals that the shearing stress varies linearly from zero at the edge
of the flange to a maximum value at the juncture with the web.

2. Compute the shear flow

Determine the shear flow at E and F (Fig. 31) by setting Q'mq= VQII equal to the static
moment of the overhanging portion of the flange. (For convenience, use the dimensions
to the centerline of the web and flange.) Thus /= 1Xw(O.! O)(16)3 + 2(8)(0.10)(S)2 = 137 in4
(5702.3 cm4); QBE = 5(0.10)(8) = 4.0 in3 (65.56 cm3); QFG•= 3(0.10)(8) = 2.4 in3 (39.34
cm3); ^= VQ8JI= 10,000(4.0)/!37 = 292 Ib/lin in (5 U37.0 N/m); ?F = 10,000(2.4)/!37
= 175 Ib/lin in (30,647.2 N/m).

3. Compute the shearing forces on the transverse section

Since the shearing stress varies linearly across the flange, K1 = H(292)(5) = 730 Ib
(3247.0 N); K2 = 1A(IlS)Q) = 263 Ib (1169.8 N); K3 = P = 10,000 Ib (44,480 N).

4. Locate the shear center

Take moments of all forces acting on the left-hand portion of the beam with respect to a
longitudinal axis through the shear center O. Thus V3e + 16(K2- K1) = O, or 10,00Oe +
16(263 - 730) - O; e = 0.747 in (18.9738 mm).

5. Verify the computed values

Check the computed values ofqE and qF by considering the bending stresses directly. Ap-
ply the equation A/= VyII9 where A/= increase in bending stress per unit distance along
the span at distance y from the neutral axis. Then A /= 10,000(8)/137 = 584 Ib/(in2-in)
(158.52 MPa/m).
In Fig. 31c, set AB = 1 in (25.4 mm). Then qE = 584(5)(0.10) = 292 Ib/lin in (51,137.0
N/m); qF = 584(3)(0.10) = 175 Ib/lin in (30,647.1 N/m).
Although a particular type of beam (cantilever) was selected here for illustrative pur-
poses and a numeric value was assigned to the vertical shear, note that the value of e is in-
dependent of the type of beam, form of loading, or magnitude of the vertical shear. The
location of the shear center is a geometric characteristic of the transverse section.

BENDING OFA CIRCULAR FLATPLATE

A circular steel plate 2 ft (0.61 m) in diameter and 1A in (12.7 mm) thick, simply support-
ed along its periphery, carries a uniform load of 20 lb/in2 (137.9 kPa) distributed over the
entire area. Determine the maximum bending stress and deflection of this plate, using
0.25 for Poisson's ratio.

Calculation Procedure:

1. Compute the maximum stress in the plate

If the maximum deflection of the plate is less than about one-half the thickness, the ef-
fects of diaphragm behavior may be disregarded.
Compute the maximum stress, using the relation/= (3Xs)(S + v)w(R/t)2, where R = plate
radius, in (mm); t = plate thickness, in (mm); v = Poisson's ratio. Thus, / =
(3/8)(3.25)(20)(12/0.5)2 = 14,000 lb/in2 (96,530.0 kPa).

2. Compute the maximum deflection of the plate

Use the relation^ = (1 - v)(5 + v)/R2/[2(3 + V)Et] = 0.75(5.25)(14,000)(12)2/[2(3.25)(30 x
106)(0.5)] = 0.081 in (2.0574 mm). Since the deflection is less than one-half the thickness,
the foregoing equations are valid in this case.

BENDING OFA RECTANGULAR FLATPLATE

A2 x 3 ft ( 6 1 .Ox 91.4 cm) rectangular plate, simply supported along its periphery, is to
carry a uniform load of 8 lb/in2 (55.2 kPa) distributed over the entire area. If the allowable
bending stress is 15,000 lb/in2 (103.4 MPa), what thickness of plate is required?

Calculation Procedure:

1. Select an equation for the stress in the plate

Use the approximation/= a2b2w/[2(a2 + b2)t2], where a and b denote the length of the
plate sides, in (mm).

2. Compute the required plate thickness

Solve the equation in step 1 for t. Thus t2 = a2b2w/[2(a2 + b2)f] = 22(3)2(144)(8)/[2(22 +
32)(15,000)] = 0.106; t = 0.33 in (8.382 mm).

COMBINED BENDING AND AXIAL
LOAD ANALYSIS

A post having the cross section shown in Fig. 32 carries a concentrated load of 100 kips
(444.8 kN) applied at R. Determine the stress induced at each corner.

Calculation Procedure:

1. Replace the eccentric load with an equivalent system

Use a concentric load of 100 kips (444.8 kN) and two couples producing the following
moments with respect to the coordinate axes:

Mx = 100,000(2) = 200,000 lb-in (25,960 N-m)

My = 100,000(1) = 100,000 lb-in (12,980 N-m)

FIGURE 32. Transverse section of
a post

S e c t i on X -X

FIGURE 33. Curved member in bending.

2. Compute the section modulus

Determine the section modulus of the rectangular cross section with respect to each axis.
Thus Sx = (Vejbd2 - (%)(18)(24)2 = 1728 in3 (28,321.9 cm3); Sy = (%)(24)(18)2 = 1296 in3
(21,241 cm3).

3. Compute the stresses produced

Compute the uniform stress caused by the concentric load and the stresses at the edges
caused by the bending moments. Thus/! = PIA = 100,000/[ 18(24)] = 231 lb/in2 (1592.7
kPa);/ = MxISx = 200,000/1728 = 116 lb/in2 (799.8 kPa);}j, = MyISy = 100,000/1296 =
77 lb/in2 (530.9 kPa).

4. Determine the stress at each corner

Combine the results obtained in step 3 to obtain the stress at each corner. Thus fA = 231 +
116 + 77 = 424 lb/in2 (2923.4 kPa);/5 = 231 + 116 - 77 = 270 lb/in2 (1861.5 kPa);/c =
231 - 116 + 77 = 192 lb/in2 (1323.8 kPa);/^ = 231 - 116 - 77 = 38 lb/in2 (262.0 kPa).
These stresses are all compressive because a positive stress is considered compressive,
whereas a tensile stress is negative.

5. Check the computed corner stresses

Use the following equation that applies to the special case of a rectangular cross section:/
= (PIA)(I ± 6ex/dx + 6ey/dy), where ex and ey = eccentricity of load with respect to the x
and y axes, respectively; dx and dy = side of rectangle, in (mm), normal to x m\dy axes, re-
spectively. Solving for the quantities within the brackets gives 6CxIdx = 6(2)/24 = 0.5;
6ey/dy = 6(1)718 = 0.33. Then/4 = 231(1 + 0.5 + 0.33) = 424 lb/in2 (2923.4 kPa);)i =
231(1 + 0.5 - 0.33) = 270 lb/in2 (1861.5 kPa);/c = 231(1 - 0.5 + 0.33) = 192 lb/in2
(1323.8 kPa);/D = 231(1 - 0.5 - 0.33) = 38 lb/in2 (262.0 kPa). These results veriiy those
computed in step 4.

FLEXURAL STRESS IN A CURVED MEMBER

The ring in Fig. 33 has an internal diameter of 12 in (304.8 mm) and a circular cross sec-
tion of 4-in (101.6-mm) diameter. Determine the normal stress at A and at B (Fig. 33).

Calculation Procedure:

1. Determine the geometrical properties of the cross section

The area of the cross section is ,4 = 0.7854(4)2 = 12.56 in2 (81.037 cm2); the section mod-
ulus is S = 0.7854(2)3 = 6.28 in3 (102.92 cm3). With c = 2 in (50.8 mm), the radius of cur-
vature to the centroidal axis of this section is R = 6 + 2 = 8 in (203.2 mm).

2. Compute the R/c ratio and determine the correction factors

Refer to a table of correction factors for curved flexural members, such as Roark—For-
mulas for Stress and Strain, and extract the correction factors at the inner and outer sur-
face associated with the RIc ratio. Thus RIc = 8/2 = 4; kt =l.23;k0 = 0.84.

3. Determine the normal stress

Find the normal stress at A and B caused by an equivalent axial load and moment. Thus fA
= PIA + kt(M/S) = 9000/12.56 + 1.23(9000 x 8)76.28 = 14,820-lb/in2 (102,183.9-kPa)
compression;/* = 9000/12.56 - 0.84(900Ox 8)76.28 = 8930-lb/in2 (61,572.3-kPa) tension.

SOfL PRESSURE UNDER DAM

A concrete gravity dam has the profile
shown in Fig. 34. Determine the soil
pressure at the toe and heel of the dam
when the water surface is level with the
top.

Calculation Procedure:

1. Resolve the dam into
suitable elements

The soil prism underlying the dam may
be regarded as a structural member sub-
jected to simultaneous axial load and
bending, the cross section of the member
being identical with the bearing surface
of the dam. Select a 1-ft (0.3-m) length
of dam as representing the entire struc-
ture. The weight of the concrete is 150
lb/ft3(23.56kN/m3).
Resolve the dam into the elements
AED and EBCD. Compute the weight of
each element, and locate the resultant of
the weight with respect to the toe. Thus
W1 = 1/2(12)(20)(150) = 18,000 Ib (80.06

Water surface

kN); W2 = 3(2O)(ISO) = 9000 Ib (40.03 kN); ^W= 18,000 + 9000 = 27,000 Ib (120.10
kN). ThCnJC1 - (2/s)(12) = 8.0 ft (2.44m); x2 = 12 + 1.5 = 13.5 ft (4.11 m).

2. Find the magnitude and location of the resultant of the
hydrostatic pressure

Calling the resultant H= Y2wh2 = 1/2(62.4)(20)2 = 12,480 Ib (55.51 kN), where w = weight
of water, lb/ft3 (N/m3), and h = water height, ft (m), thenj = (1/s)(20) = 6.67 ft (2.03 m).

3. Compute the moment of the loads with respect to the
base centerline

Thus, M= 18,000(8 - 7.5) + 9000(13.5 - 7.5) - 12,480(6.67) = 20,200 lb-ft (27,391 N-m)
counterclockwise.

4. Compute the section modulus of the base

Use the relation S = (1A)Zx/2 = (1A)(I)(IS)2 = 37.5 ft3 (1.06 m3).

5. Determine the soil pressure at the dam toe and heel

Compute the soil pressure caused by the combined axial load and bending. Thus /j =
^WIA + MIS = 27,000/15 + 20,200/37.5 = 2339 lb/ft2 (111.99 kPa);/2 = 1800 - 539 =
126 l i b / f t2 (60.37 kPa).

6. Verify the computed results

Locate the resultant R of the trapezoidal pressure prism, and take its moment with respect
to the centerline of the base. Thus R = 27,000 Ib (120.10 kN); m = (15/3)((2 x 1261 +
2339)7(1261 + 2339)] = 6.75 ft (2.05 m); MR = 27,000(7.50 - 6.75) = 20,200 lb-ft (27,391
N-m). Since the applied and resisting moments are numerically equal, the computed re-
sults are correct.

LOAD DISTRIBUTION IN PILE GROUP

A continuous wall is founded on three rows of piles spaced 3 ft (0.91 m) apart. The longi-
tudinal pile spacing is 4 ft (1.21 m) in the front and center rows and 6 ft (1.82 m) in the
rear row. The resultant of vertical loads on the wall is 20,000 Ib/lin ft (291.87 kN/m) and
lies 3 ft 3 in (99.06 cm) from the front row. Determine the pile load in each row.

( c) P i le reac t ions

Calculation Procedure:

1. Identify the "repeating group" of piles

The concrete footing (Fig. 350) binds the piles, causing the surface along the top of the
piles to remain a plane as bending occurs. Therefore, the pile group may be regarded as a
structural member subjected to axial load and bending, the cross section of the member
being the aggregate of the cross sections of the piles.
Indicate the "repeating group" as shown in Fig. 35Z>.

2. Determine the area of the pile group and the moment of inertia

Calculate the area of the pile group, locate its centroidal axis, and find the moment of in-
ertia. Since all the piles have the same area, set the area of a single pile equal to unity.
Then ,4 = 3+ 3 +2 = 8.
Take moments with respect to row A. Thus &t = 3(0) + 3(3) + 2(6); Jt = 2.625 ft
(66.675 mm). Then /= 3(2.625)2 + 3(0.375)2 + 2(3.375)2 = 43.9.

3. Compute the axial load and bending moment on the pile group

The axial load P = 20,000(12) = 240,000 Ib (1067.5 JdST); then M= 240,000(3.25 - 2.625)
= 150,000 lb-ft (203.4 kN-m).

4. Determine the pile load in each row

Find the pile load in each row resulting from the combined axial load and moment. Thus,
PIA = 240,000/8 = 30,000 Ib (133.4 kN) per pile; then MII= 150,000/43.9 = 3420. Also,
pa = 30,000 - 3420(2.625) = 21,020 Ib (93.50 kN) per pile; pb = 30,000 + 3420(0.375) =
31,280 Ib (139.13 kN) per pile; pc = 30,000 + 3420(3.375) = 41,540 Ib (184.76 kN) per
pile.

5. Verify the above results

Compute the total pile reaction, the moment of the applied load, and the pile reaction with
respect to row A. Thus, R = 3(21,020) + 3(31,280) + 2(41,540) = 239,980 Ib (1067.43
kN); then Ma = 240,000(3.25) = 780,000 lb-ft (1057.68 kN-m), and Mr = 3(31,280)(3) +
2(41,540)(6) = 780,000 lb-ft (1057.68 kN-m). Since Ma = Mn the computed results are
verified.

Deflection of Beams

In this handbook the slope of the elastic curve at a given section of a beam is denoted by
B, and the deflection, in inches, by y. The slope is considered positive if the section rotates
in a clockwise direction under the bending loads. A downward deflection is considered
positive. In all instances, the beam is understood to be prismatic, if nothing is stated to the
contrarv.

DOUBLE-INTEGRATION METHOD OF
DETERMINING BEAM DEFLECTION

The simply supported beam in Fig. 36 is subjected to a counterclockwise moment N ap-
plied at the right-hand support. Determine the slope of the elastic curve at each support
and the maximum deflection of the beam.

FIGURE 36. Deflection of simple beam under end moment.

Calculation Procedure:

1. Evaluate the bending moment at a given section

Make this evaluation in terms of the distance x from the left-hand support to this section.
Thus RL = N/L; M = NxIL.

2. Write the differential equation of the elastic curve;
integrate twice

Thus Elcfy/dx2 = -M = -Nx/L; Eldyldx = EIS = -Nx2/(2L) + C1; Ely = -Nx3/(6L) + C1X +

C2.

3. Evaluate, the constants of integration

Apply the following boundary conditions: When x = O, y = O; /. C2 = O; when x = L, y = O;
/ . C1 =NL/6.

4. Write the slope and deflection equations

Substitute the constant values found in step 3 in the equations developed in step 2. Thus
O = [N/(6EIL)](L2 - 3*2); y = [Nx/(6EIL)](L2 - x2).

5. Find the slope at the supports

Substitute the values x = O, x = L in the slope equation to determine the slope at the sup-
ports. Thus S1 = NL/(6EI); SR = -NL/(3EI).

6. Solve for the section of maximum deflection

Set 6 = O and solve for ;c to locate the section of maximum deflection. Thus L2 - 3x2 = O;
x = L/3 °5. Substituting in the deflection equation gives ymsai = M,2/(9£/3°5).

Use the moment-area method to determine the slope of the elastic curve at each support
and the maximum deflection of the beam shown in Fig. 36.

Calculation Procedure:

1. Sketch the elastic curve of the member and draw the
Mf(EI) diagram

Let A and B denote two points on the elastic curve of a beam. The moment-area method is
based on the following theorems:
The difference between the slope at A and that at B is numerically equal to the area of
the MI(EI) diagram within the interval AB.

The deviation of A from a tangent to the elastic curve through B is numerically equal
to the static moment of the area of the MI(EI) diagram within the interval AB with respect
to A. This tangential deviation is measured normal to the unstrained position of the beam.
Draw the elastic curve and the MI(EI) diagram as shown in Fig. 37.

2. Calculate the deviation t1 of B from the tangent through A

Thus, J1 = moment of MBC about BC = [NL/(2EI)](L/3) = NL2/(6EI). Also, 6L = I1IL =
NL/(6EI).

3. Determine the right-hand slope in an analogous manner
4. Compute the distance to the section where the slope is zero

Area MED = area MBC(x/L)2 = Nx1J(TEIL); 0E = B1 - area MED = NL/(6EI) 
Nx2/(2EIL) = Q;x = L/3Q5.

-

5. Evaluate the maximum deflection

Evaluate ymax by calculating the deviation t2 of A from the tangent through E' (Fig. 37).
Thus area MED = O1 = NL/(6EI); ymax = t2 = NL/(6EI)](2x/3) = [NL/(6EI)][(2L/(3 x 3°5)]
- M,2/(9£Y3°5), as before.

CONJUGATE-BEAM METHOD OF
DETERMINING BEAM DEFLECTION

The overhanging beam in Fig. 38 is loaded in the manner shown. Compute the deflection
at C.

Calculation Procedure:

1. Assign supports to the conjugate beam

of the latter, the shear V and bending mo-
ment M' of the conjugate beam are equal,
respectively, to the slope 0 and deflection >>
at the corresponding section of the given
beam.
Assign supports to the conjugate beam
that are compatible with the end conditions
of the given beam. At A
 the given beam
has a specific slope but zero deflection.
Correspondingly, the conjugate beam has a
specific shear but zero moment; i.e., it is
simply supported at A.
At C, the given beam has a specific
slope and a specific deflection. Corre-
spondingly, the conjugate beam has both a

shear and a bending moment; i.e., it has a

Calculation Procedure:

1. Apply a unit horizontal load

Apply the unit horizontal load at A9 directed to the right.

2. Evaluate the bending moments in each member

Let M and m denote the bending moment at a given section caused by the load P and by
the unit load, respectively. Evaluate these moments in each member, considering a mo-
ment positive if it induces tension in the outer fibers of the frame. Thus:
Member AB: Let x denote the vertical distance from A to a given section. Then M= O;
m = x.
Member BC: Let x denote the horizontal distance from B to a given section. Then M=
Px; m= a.
Member CD: Let x denote the vertical distance from C to a given section. Then M =
Pb; m = a - x.

3. Evaluate the required deflection

Calling the required deflection A, we apply A = / [MmI(EI)] dx; EIA = Jg Poxdx + /g Pb(a
~x)dx = Pax2/2]b
0 + Pb(ax - X2/2)]C
0 = Pab2/2 + Pabc - Pbc2/2; A = [Pb/(2EI)](ab + 2ac -
c2).
If this value is positive, A is displaced in the direction of the unit load, i.e., to the right.
Draw the elastic curve in hyperbolic fashion (Fig. 4Ob). The above three steps constitute
the unit-load method of solving this problem.

4. Construct the bending-moment diagram

Draw the diagram as shown in Fig. 4Oc.

5. Compute the rotation and horizontal displacement by the
moment-area method

Determine the rotation and horizontal displacement of C. (Consider only absolute values.)
Since there is no rotation at D, EISc =

7. Compute the horizontal displacement of one point
relative to another

Thus, EIk2 = EIO^ = Pb(ac + ab/2).

8. Combine the computed displacements to obtain the absolute
displacement

Thus E7A = £/(A2 - ^7A1) = Pb(ac + ab/2 - c2/2); A = [Pb/(2EI)](2ac + ab- c2).

Statically Indeterminate Structures

A structure is said to be statically determinate if its reactions and internal forces may be
evaluated by applying solely the equations of equilibrium and statically indeterminate if
such is not the case. The analysis of an indeterminate structure is performed by combining
the equations of equilibrium with the known characteristics of the deformation of the
structure.

SHEAR AND BENDING MOMENT OF A BEAM
ONA YIELDING SUPPORT

The beam in Fig. 41« has an EI value of 35 x 109 lb-in2 (100,429 kN-m2) and bears on a
spring at B that has a constant of 100 kips/in (175,126.8 kN/m); i.e., a force of 100 kips
(444.8 kN) will compress the spring 1 in (25.4 mm). Neglecting the weight of the mem-
ber, construct the shear and bending-moment diagrams.

( b) F o r ce d iag ram

FIGURE 41

Calculation Procedure:

1. Draw the free-body diagram of the beam

Draw the diagram in Fig. 4lb. Consider this as a simply supported member carrying a 50-
kip (222.4-kN) load at D and an upward load R8 at its center.

2. Evaluate the deflection

Evaluate the deflection at B by applying the equations presented for cases 7 and 8 in the
AISC Manual With respect to the 50-kip (222.4-kN) load, b = 1 ft (2.1 m) and x = 14 ft
(4.3 m). If y is in inches and R8 is in pounds, y = 50,000(7)(14)(282 - 72 - 142)1728/
[6(35)(10)928] -^(28)31728/[48(35)(10)9] = 0.776 - (2.26/105)^.

3. Express the deflection in terms of the spring constant
The deflection at B is, by proportion, yl

A column bearing on the 16-in (406.4-mm) beam transmits a load of 15 kips (66.72 kN)
at the indicated location. Compute the maximum bending stress in the 12-in (304.8-mm)
beam.

Calculation Procedure:

1. Determine whether the upper beam engages the lower beam

To ascertain whether the upper beam engages the lower one as it deflects under the 15-kip
(66.72-kN) load, compute the deflection of the 16-in (406.4-mm) beam at V if the 12-in
(304.8-mm) beam were absent. This distance is 0.74 in (18.80 mm). Consequently, the
gap between the members is closed, and the two beams share the load.

2. Draw a free-body diagram of each member

Let P denote the load transmitted to the 12-in (304.8-mm) beam by the 16-in (406.4-mm)
beam [or the reaction of the 12-in (304.8-mm) beam on the 16-in (406.4-mm) beam].
Draw, in Fig. 426, a free-body diagram of each member.

3. Evaluate the deflection of the beams

Evaluate, in terms of P, the deflections yl2 and ^16 of the 12-in (304.8-mm) and 16-in
(406.4-mm) beams, respectively, at line V.

4. Express the relationship between the two deflections

Thus, .y12=.y16-0.375.

5. Replace the deflections in step 4 with their values as obtained
in step 3

After substituting these deflections, solve for P.

6. Compute the reactions of the lower beam

Once the reactions of the lower beam are computed, obtain the maximum bending mo-
ment. Then compute the corresponding flexural stress.

THEOREMOFTHREEMOMENTS

For the two-span beam in Fig. 43a, compute the reactions at the supports. Apply the theo-
rem of three moments to arrive at the results.

Calculation Procedure:

1. Using the bending-moment equation, determine MB

Figure 436 represents a general case. For a prismatic beam, the bending moments at the
three successive supports are related by M1L1 + 2M2(L1 + L2) + M3L2 - 1^w1L? - 1Aw2Lq -
P1L^k1 - k\) - P2LKk2 - K2). Substituting in this equation gives M1 = M3 = O; L1 = 10 ft
(3.0 m); L2 = 15 ft (4.6 m); W1 = 2 kips/lin ft (29.2 kN/m); W2 - 3 kips/lin ft (43.8 kN/m);
P1 = 6 kips (26.7 N); P2 = 10 kips (44.5 N); Jt1 = 0.5; k2 = 0.4; 2M5(IO + 15) = -Vi(2)(10)3
- 1X4(S)(IS)3 - 6(10)2(0.5 - 0.125) - 10(15)2(0.4 - 0.064); MB = -80.2 ft-kips (-108.8
kN-m).

2. Draw a free-body diagram of each span

Figure 43c shows the free-body diagrams.

FIGURE 44

3. Take moments with respect to each support to find the
reactions

Span AB: SM4 - 6(5) + 2(10)(5) + 80.2 - KXR51 = O; Rm = 21.02 kips (93.496 kN);
SM5 = IORA - 6(5) - 2(10)(5) + 80.2 = O; RA = 4.98 kips (22.151 kN).
Span BC: SM5 = -80.2 + 10(9) + 3(15)(7.5) - 15RC = Q;RC = 23.15 kips (102.971
kN); 2MC = 15^52 - 80.2 - 10(6) - 3(15)(7.5) = O; R82 = 31.85 kips (144.668 kN); RB =
21.02 + 31.85 = 52.87 kips (235.165 kN).

THEOREM OF THREE MOMENTS: BEAM
WITH OVERHANG AND FIXED END

Determine the reactions at the supports of the continuous beam in Fig. 440. Use the theo-
rem of three moments.

Calculation Procedure:

1. Transform the given beam to one amenable to analysis by the
theorem of three moments

Perform the following operations to transform the beam:

a. Remove the span AB, and introduce the shear VB and moment M5 that the load on AB
induces at J5, as shown in Fig. 44Z).
b. Remove the fixed support at D and add the span DE of zero length, with a hinged sup-
port at E.
For the interval BD, the transformed beam is then identical in every respect with the
actual beam.

2. Apply the equation for the theorem of three moments

Consider span BC as span 1 and CD as span 2. For the 5-kip (22.2-kN) load, k2 = 12/16 =
0.75; for the 10-kip (44.5-kN) load, Ic2 = 8/16 - 0.5. Then -12(10) + 2MC(10 + 16) +
16MD = -tt(4)(10)3 - 5(16)2(0.75 - 0.422) - 10(16)2(0.5 - 0.125). Simplifying gives
13MC + 4MD = -565.0, Eq. a.

3. Apply the moment equation again

Considering CD as span 1 and DE as span 2, apply the moment equation again. Or, for the
5-kip (22.2-kN) load, Jt1 = 0.25; for the 10-kip (44.5-kN) load, Jt1 = 0.5. Then 16MC +
2MD(16 + O) = -5(16)2(0.25 - 0.016) - 10(16)2(0.50 - 0.125). Simplifying yields Mc +
2MD = -78.7,Eq. b.

4. Solve the moment equations

Solving Eqs. a and b gives Mc = -37.1 ft-kips (-50.30 kN-m); MD = -20.8 ft-kips (-28.20
kN-m).

5. Determine the reactions by using a free-body diagram

Find the reactions by drawing a free-body diagram of each span and taking moments with
respect to each support. Thus RB = 20.5 kips (91.18 kN); Rc = 32.3 kips (143.67 kN);
RD= 5.2 kips (23.12 kN).

BENDING-MOMENT DETERMINATION BY
MOMENT DISTRIBUTION

Using moment distribution, determine the bending moments at the supports of the mem-
ber in Fig. 45. The beams are rigidly joined at the supports and are composed of the same
material.

Calculation Procedure:

1. Calculate the flexural stiffness of each span

Using K to denote the flexural stiffness, we see that K = HL if the far end remains fixed
during moment distribution; K= 0.75//L if the far end remains hinged during moment dis-
tribution. Then KAB = 270/18 = 15; KBC = 192/12 = 16; KCD = 0.75(240/20) = 9. Record
all the values on the drawing as they are obtained.

2. For each span, calculate the required fixed-end moments at
those supports that will be considered fixed

These are the external moments with respect to the span; a clockwise moment is consid-
ered positive. (For additional data, refer to cases 14 and 15 in the AISC Manual.) Then
MAB = -wL2/12 - -2(18)2/12 = -54.0 ft-kips (-73.2 kN-m); MBA = +54.0 ft-kips (73.22
kN-m). Similarly, MBC = -48.0 ft-kips (-65.1 kN-m); MCB = +48.0 ft-kips (65.1 kN-m);
MCD = -24(15)(5)(15 + 20)/[2(20)2] = -78.8 ft-kips (-106.85 kN-m).

3. Calculate the unbalanced moments

Computing the unbalanced moments at B and C yields the following: At B, +54.0 - 48.0 =
+ 6.0 ft-kips (8.14 kN-m); at C, +48.0 - 78.8 = -30.8 fit-kips (-41.76 kN-m).

4. Apply balancing moments; distribute them in proportion to the
stiffness of the adjoining spans

Apply the balancing moments at B and C, and distribute them to the two adjoining spans
in proportion to their stiffness. Thus MBA = -6.0(15/31) = -2.9 ft-kips (-3.93 kN-m);
MBC = -6.0(16/31) = -3.1 ft-kips (-4.20 kN-m); MCB = +30.8(16/25) = +19.7 ft-kips
(26.71 kN m); MCD = +30.8(9/25) = +11.1 ft-kips (15.05 kN-m).

5. Perform the "carry-over" operation for each span

To do this, take one-half the distributed moment applied at one end of the span, and add
this to the moment at the far end if that end is considered to be fixed during moment dis-
tribution.

6. Perform the second cycle of moment balancing and distribution

Thus MBA = -9.9(15/31) = -4.8; MBC = -9.9(16/31) - -5.1; MCB = +1.6(16/25) = + 1.0;
MO, = +1.6(9/25) = +0.6.

7. Continue the foregoing procedure until the carry-over moments
become negligible

Total the results to obtain the following bending moments: MA = -58.2 ft-kips (-78.91 kN
m); MB = -45.7 ft-kips (-61.96 kN-m); Mc = -66.1 ft-kips (-89.63 kN-m).

ANALYSIS OFA STATICALLY
INDETERMINATE TRUSS

Determine the internal forces of the truss in Fig. 46a. The cross-sectional areas of the
members are given in Table 5.

Calculation Procedure:

1. Test the structure for static determinateness

Apply the following criterion. Let j = number of joints; m = number of members; r =
number of reactions. Then if 2/ = m + r, the truss is statically determinate; if 2/ < m + r,
the truss is statically indeterminate and
the deficiency represents the degree of in-
determinateness.
In this truss, j = 6, m = 10, r = 3, con-
sisting of a vertical reaction at A and D
and a horizontal reaction at D. Thus 2/ =
12; m + r = 13. The truss is therefore stat-
ically indeterminate to the first degree;
i.e., there is one redundant member.
The method of analysis comprises the
following steps: Assume a value for the
internal force in a particular member, and
calculate the relative displacement A,, of
the two ends of that member caused sole-
ly by this force. Now remove this member
to secure a determinate truss, and calcu-
late the relative displacement Aa caused
solely by the applied loads. The true inter-
nal force is of such magnitude that A1- =
-Aa.

2. Assume a unit force for one
member

Assume for convenience that the force in
BF is 1-kip (4.45-kN) tension. Remove
this member, and replace it with the as-
sumed 1-kip (4.45-kN) force that it exerts 
at joints B and F, as shown in Fig. 46b.

3. Calculate the force induced in each member solely
by the unit force

Calling the induced force U9 produced solely by the unit tension in BF, record the results
in Table 5, considering tensile forces as positive and compressive forces as negative.

4. Calculate the force Induced In each member solely
by the applied loads

With BF eliminated, calculate the force S induced in each member solely by the applied
loads.

5. Evaluate the true force in the selected member

Use the relation BF = -\^SULI (AE)]I^V2 Ll (AE)]. The numerator represents Aa; the de-
nominator represents A4 for a 1-kip (4.45-kN) tensile force in BF. Since E is constant, it
cancels. Substituting the values in Table 5 gives BF = -(-266.5/135.5) = 1.97 kips (8.76
kN). The positive result confirms the assumption that BF is tensile.

6. Evaluate the true force in each member

Use the relation S' = S + 1.97 U9 where S' = true force. The results are shown in Table 5.

Moving Loads and Influence Lines

ANALYSIS OF BEAM CARRYING MOVING
CONCENTRATED LOADS

The loads shown in Fig. 41 a traverse a beam of 40-ft (12.2-m) simple span while their
spacing remains constant. Determine the maximum bending moment and maximum shear
induced in the beam during transit of these loads. Disregard the weight of the beam.

(a) Load system

(b) Position I, for 10-kip ( 4 4 . 5 - kN) load

(c) Position 2, for 4-kip (17 .8 -kN) load

(d) Position 3, for 15-kip (66 .7 - kN) load
FIGURE 47

Calculation Procedure:

1. Determine the magnitude of the resultant and its location

Since the member carries only concentrated loads, the maximum moment at any instant
occurs under one of these loads. Thus, the problem is to determine the position of the load
system that causes the absolute maximum moment.
The magnitude of the resultant # 1 8 ^ = 10 + 4 + 15 = 29 kips (129.0 kN). To deter-
mine the location of R, take moments with respect to A (Fig. 47). Thus 2M4 = 29AD =
4(5) + 15(17), or AD = 9.48 ft (2.890 m).

2. Assume several trial load positions

Assume that the maximum moment occurs under the 10-kip (44.5-kN) load. Place the
system in the position shown in Fig. 4Ib9 with the 10-kip (44.5-kN) load as far from the
adjacent support as the resultant is from the other support. Repeat this procedure for the
two remaining loads.

3. Determine the support reactions for the trial load positions

For these three trial positions, calculate the reaction at the support adjacent to the load un-
der consideration. Determine whether the vertical shear is zero or changes sign at this
load. Thus, for position 1: RL = 29(15.26)740 = 11.06 kips (49.194 kN). Since the shear
does not change sign at the 10-kip (44.5-kN) load, this position lacks significance.
Position 2: R1= 29(17.76)740 = 12.88 kips (57.290 kN). The shear changes sign at the
4-kip (17.8 kN) load.
Position 3: RR = 29(16.24)740 = 11.77 kips (52.352 kN). The shear changes sign at the
15-kip(66.7-kN)load.

4. Compute the maximum bending moment associated with
positions having a change in the shear sign

This applies to positions 2 and 3. The absolute maximum moment is the larger of these
values. Thus, for position 2: M= 12.88(17.76) - 10(5) = 178.7 ft-kips (242.32 kN-m). Po-
sition 3: M= 11.77(16.24) = 191.1 ft-kips (259.13 kN-m). Thus, Mmax = 191.1 ft-kips
(259.13 kN-m).

5. Determine the absolute maximum shear

For absolute maximum shear, place the 15-kip (66.7-kN) load an infinitesimal distance
to the left of the right-hand support. Then Fmax = 29(40 - 7.52)740 = 23.5 kips (104.53
kN).
When the load spacing is large in relation to the beam span, the absolute maximum
moment may occur when only part of the load system is on the span. This possibility re-
quires careful investigation.

INFLUENCE LINE FOR SHEAR IN A
BRIDGE TRUSS

The Pratt truss in Fig. 48a supports a bridge at its bottom chord. Draw the influence line
for shear in panel cd caused by a moving load traversing the bridge floor.

Calculation Procedure:

1. Compute the shear in the panel being considered with a unit
load to the right of the panel

Cut the truss at section YY. The algebraic sum of vertical forces acting on the truss at pan-
el points to the left of IT is termed the shear in panel cd.

FIGURE 48

Consider thai a moving load traverses the bridge floor from right to left and that the
portion of the load carried by the given truss is 1 kip (4.45 kN). This unit load is transmit-
ted to the truss as concentrated loads at two adjacent bottom-chord panel points, the latter
being components of the unit load. Let jc denote the instantaneous distance from the right-
hand support to the moving load.
Place the unit load to the right of d, as shown in Fig. 486, and compute the shear Vcd in
panel cd. The truss reactions may be obtained by considering the unit load itself rather
than its panel-point components. Thus: R1 = x/120; Vcd = RL= #/120, Eq. a.

2. Compute the panel shear with the unit load to the left
of the panel considered

Placing the unit load to the left of c yields Vcd = R1 - 1 = jt/120 - 1, Eq. b.

3. Determine the panel shear with the unit load within the panel

Place the unit load within panel cd. Determine the panel-point load Pc at c, and compute
Vcd. Thus Pc = (x- 60)720 = jc/20 - 3; Vcd = R1 - Pc = Jc/120 - (jc/20 - 3) = -jt/24 + 3, Eq.
c.

4. Construct a diagram representing the shear associated
with every position of the unit load

Apply the foregoing equations to represent the value of Vcd associated with every position
of the unit load. This diagram, Fig. 48c, is termed an influence line. The pointy at which
this line intersects the base is referred to as the neutral point.

5. Compute the slope of each segment of the influence line

Line a, dVJdx = 1/120; line b, dVJdx = 1/120; line c, dVJdx = -1/24. Lines a and b are
therefore parallel because they have the same slope.

FORCE IN TRUSS DIAGONAL CAUSED
BYA MOVING UNIFORM LOAD

The bridge floor in Fig. 48« carries a moving uniformly distributed load. The portion of
the load transmitted to the given truss is 2.3 kips/lin ft (33.57 kN/m). Determine the limit-
ing values of the force induced in member Cd by this load.

Calculation Procedure:

1. Locate the neutral point, and compute dh

The force in Cd is a function of Vcd. Locate the neutral pointy in Fig. 48c and compute dh.
From Eq. c of the previous calculation procedure, Vcd = -jg/24 + S = 0;yg = 72 ft (21.9
m). From Eq. a of the previous procedure, dh = 60/120 = 0.5.

2. Determine the maximum shear

To secure the maximum value of Vcd, apply uniform load continuously in the interval jg.
Compute Vcd by multiplying the area under the influence line by the intensity of the ap-
plied load. Thus, Vcd = 1/2(72)(0.5)(2.3) = 41.4 kips (184.15 kN).

3. Determine the maximum force in the member

Use the relation Cdmax = Vcd(csc 6), where esc 6 = [(2O2 + 252)/252]0-5 = 1.28. Then
Ctfmax = 41.4(1.28) = 53.0-kip (235.74-kN) tension.

4. Determine the minimum force in the member

To secure the minimum value of Vcd, apply uniform load continuously in the interval of.
Perform the final calculation by proportion. Thus, Cdmin/Cdmax = area azy/area jhg =
-(2/3)2 = 9. Then O/min = -<4/9)(53.0) = 23.6-kip (104.97-kN) compression.

FORCE IN TRUSS DIAGONAL CAUSED BY
MOVING CONCENTRATED LOADS

The truss in Fig. 49a supports a bridge that transmits the moving-load system shown in
Fig. 496 to its bottom chord. Determine the maximum tensile force in De.

Calculation Procedure:

1. Locate the resultant of the load system

The force in De (Fig. 49) is a function of the shear in panel de. This shear is calculated
without recourse to a set rule in order to show the principles involved in designing for
moving loads.
To locate the resultant of the load system, take moments with respect to load 1.
Thus, R = SQ kips (222.4 kN). Then SM1 = 12(6) + 18(16) + 15(22) = 50*; x = 13.8 ft
(4.21 m).

2. Construct the influence line for Vde

In Fig. 49c, draw the influence line for Vde. Assume right-to-left locomotion, and express
the slope of each segment of the influence line. Thus slope of ik = slope of ma = 1/200;
slope of km = -7/200.

(b) Load system

(c) Influence line for shear in panel de

FIGURE 49

3. Assume a load position, and determine whether Vde increases
or decreases

Consider that load 1 lies within panel de and the remaining loads lie to the right of this
panel. From the slope of the influence line, ascertain whether Vde increases or decreases
as the system is displaced to the left. Thus dVJdx = 5(-7/20O) + 45(1/200) > O; /. Vde in-
creases.

4. Repeat the foregoing calculation with other assumed load
positions

Consider that loads 1 and 2 lie within the panel de and the remaining loads lie to the right
of this panel. Repeat the foregoing calculation. Thus dVJdx = 17( -7/200) + 33(1/200) <
O; .*. Vde decreases.
From these results it is concluded that as the system moves from right to left, Vde is
maximum at the instant that load 2 is at e.

5. Place the system in the position thus established,
and compute Vde

Thus, RL = 50(100 + 6 - 13.8)7200 = 23.1 kips (102.75 kN). The load at panel point d is
Pd= 5(6)725 1.2 kips (5.34 kN); Vde = 23.1 - 1.2 = 21.9 kips (97.41 kN).

6. Assume left-to-right locomotion; proceed as in step 3

Consider that load 4 is within panel de and the remaining loads are to the right of this pan-
el. Proceeding as in step 3, we find dVJdx = 15(7/200) + 35( - 1/200) > O.
So, as the system moves from left to right, Vde is maximum at the instant that load 4 is
ate.
7. Place the system in the position thus established, and
compute Vde

Thus Vde = RL = [50(100 - 8.2)1/200 = 23.0 kips (102.30 kN); /. Fr f em ax = 23.0 kips
(102.3OkN).

8. Compute the maximum tensile force in De

Using the same relation as in step 3 of the previous calculation procedure, we find esc 0 =
[(252 + 302)/302]05 = 1.30; then De = 23.0(1.30) = 29.9-kip (133.00-kN) tension.

INFLUENCE LINE FOR BENDING MOMENT
IN BRIDGE TRUSS

The Warren truss in Fig. 5Oa supports a bridge at its top chord. Draw the influence line
for the bending moment at b caused by a moving load traversing the bridge floor.

panels

pane ls

(a) Warren truss

FIGURE 50

Calculation Procedure:

1. Place the unit load in position, and compute the
bending moment

The moment of all forces acting on the truss at panel points to the left of b with respect to
b is termed the bending moment at that point. Assume that the load transmitted to the giv-
en truss is 1 kip (4.45 kN), and let x denote the instantaneous distance from the right-hand
support to the moving load.
Place the unit load to the right of C, and compute the bending moment Mb. Thus RL =
*/120; Mb = 45RL = 3*/8, Eq. a.

2. Place the unit load on the other side and compute the
bending moment

Placing the unit load to the left of B and computing Mb, Mb = 45RL - (x - 75) = -5*/8 +
75, Eq. b.

3. Place the unit load within the panel; compute the panel-point
load and bending moment

Place the unit load within panel BC. Determine the panel-point load PB and compute Mb.
Thus - PB (x - 60)/30 = x/30 - 2; Mb = 45RL -15PB = 3x/8 - 15(x/30 - 2) = -jc/8 + 30, Eq. c.

4. Applying the foregoing equations, draw the influence line

Figure 506 shows the influence line for Mb. Computing the significant values yields CG =
(3/8)(60) = 22.50 ft-kips (30.51 kN-m); BH = -(5/8)(90) + 75 = 18.75 ft-kips (25.425
kN-m).

5. Compute the slope of each segment of the influence line

This computation is made for subsequent reference. Thus, line a, dM^dx = 3/8; line b,
dMddx = -5/8; line c, dMJdx = -1/8.

FORCE IN TRUSS CHORD CAUSED BY
MOVING CONCENTRATED LOADS

The truss in Fig. 5Oa carries the moving-load system shown in Fig. 51. Determine the
maximum force induced in member BC during transit of the loads.

Calculation Procedure:

1. Assume that locomotion proceeds
from right to left, and compute the
bending moment

The force in BC is a function of the bending moment
Mb at b. Refer to the previous calculation procedure
for the slope of each segment of the influence line.
Study of these slopes shows that Mb increases as the
load system moves until the rear load is at C, the
front load being 14 ft (4.3 m) to the left of C. Calcu-
late the value of Mb corresponding to this load dispo-
sition by applying the computed properties of the in-
fluence line. Thus, Mb = 22.50(24) + (22.50 - 1/8 *
14)(6) = 664.5 ft-kips (901.06 kN-m). 

FIGURE 51

2. Assume that locomotion proceeds from left to right,
and compute the bending moment

Study shows that Mb increases as the system moves until the rear load is at C, the front
load being 14 ft (4.3 m) to the right of C. Calculate the corresponding value of M6. Thus,
Mb = 22.50(24) + (22.50 - 3/8 x 14)(6) = 6435 ft-kips (872.59 kN-m). .'. Mb max = 664.5
ft-kips (901.06 kN-m).

3. Determine the maximum force in the member

Cut the truss at plane YY. Determine the maximum force in BC by considering the equi-
librium of the left part of the structure. Thus, ^Mb = Mb- 2QBC = O; BC = 664.5/20 =
33.2-kips (147.67-kN) compression.

FIGURE 52

Calculation Procedure:

1. Start the graphical construction

Draw a line through A and C, intersecting the vertical line through B at E. Draw a line
through B and C, intersecting the vertical line through A and F. Draw the vertical line GH
through D.
Let 9 denote the angle between AE and the horizontal. Lines through B and D perpen-
dicular to AE (omitted for clarity) make an angle 6 with the vertical.

2. Resolve the reaction into components

Resolve the reaction at A into the components ^1 and R2 acting along AE and AB, respec-
tively (Fig. 52).

3. Determine the value of the first reaction

Let jc denote the horizontal distance from the right-hand support to the unit load, where x
has any value between O and L. Evaluate R1 by equating the bending moment at B to zero.
Thus MB = R{b cos 6 - x = O; or = R1 = x/(b cos B).

4. Evaluate the second reaction

Place the unit load within the interval CB. Evaluate R2 by equating the bending moment at
C to zero. Thus Mc = R2d = O; /. ^2 = O.

5. Calculate the bending moment at D when the unit load lies
within the interval CB

Thus, MD = -R1V cos 6 = -[(v cos 6)/(b cos 0)]jt, or MD = -VxIb9 Eq. a. When JC = TH, MD =
—vmlb.

6. Place the unit load in a new position, and determine
the bending moment

Place the unit load within the interval AD. Working from the right-hand support, proceed
in an analogous manner to arrive at the following result: MD - v'(L — x)/a, Eq. b. When x
= L — n, MD = v'nla.

7. Place the unit load within another interval, and evaluate
the second reaction

Place the unit load within the interval DC, and evaluate R2. Thus Mc - R2d — (x — m) = O,
or R2 = (X- m)ld.
Since both R1 and R2 vary linearly with respect to x, it follows that MD is also a linear
function of Jt.

8. Complete the influence line

In Fig. 526, draw lines BR and AS to represent Eqs. a and b, respectively. Draw the
straight line SR, thus completing the influence line. The point T at which this line inter-
sects the base is termed the neutral point.

9. Locate the neutral point

To locate T, draw a line through A and D in Fig. 52a intersecting BF at J. The neutral
point in the influence line lies vertically below J; that is, MD is zero when the action line
of the unit load passes through J.
The proof is as follows: Since MD = O and there are no applied loads in the interval
AD, it follows that the total reaction at A is directed along AD. Similarly, since Mc = O
and there are no applied loads in the interval CB, it follows that the total reaction at
B is directed along BC. Because the unit load and the two reactions constitute a bal-
anced system of forces, they are collinear. Therefore, J lies on the action line of the unit
load.
Alternatively, the location of the neutral point may be established by applying the geo-
metric properties of the influence line.

DEFLECTION OF A BEAM UNDER
MOVING LOADS

The moving-load system in Fig. 53a traverses a beam on a simple span of 40 ft (12.2
m). What disposition of the system will cause the maximum deflection at midspan?

Calculation Procedure:

1. Develop the equations for the
midspan deflection under a unit load

The maximum deflection will manifestly occur
when the two loads lie on opposite sides of the cen-
terline of the span. In calculating the deflection at
midspan caused by a load applied at any point on
the span, it is advantageous to apply Maxwell's
theorem of reciprocal deflections, which states the
following: The deflection at A caused by a load at
B equals the deflection at B caused by this load at
A.

{ 

b j 

FIGURE 53 

In Fig. 536, consider the beam on a simple span
L to carry a unit load applied at a distance a from the left-hand support. By referring to
case 7 of the AISC Manual and applying the principle of reciprocal deflections, derive the
following equations for the midspan deflection under the unit load: When a < Lf2, y =
(3L2a - 4a3)/(48EI). When a < L/2, y = [3L2(L - a) - 4(L - a)3]/(48EI).

2. Position the system for purposes of analysis

Position the system in such a manner that the 20-kip (89.0-kN) load lies to the left of cen-
ter and the 12-kip (53.4-kN) load to the right of center. For the 20-kip (89.0-kN) load, set
a = x. For the 12-kip (53.4-kN) load, a = x + 7; L - a = 40 - (jc + 7) = 33 - x.

3. Express the total midspan deflection in terms of x

Substitute in the preceding equations. Combining all constants into a single term &, we
find ky = 20(3 ) x 402* - 4*3) + 12(3 x 402(33 - Jt) - 4(33 - *)3].

4. Solve for the unknown distance

Set dyldx = O and solve for x. Thus, x = 17.46 ft (5.321 m).
For maximum deflection, position the load system with the 20-kip (89.0-kN) load
17.46 ft (5.321 m) from the left-hand support.

Riveted and Welded Connections

In the design of riveted and welded connections in this handbook, the American Institute
of Steel Construction Specification for the Design, Fabrication and Erection of Structural
Steel for Buildings is applied. This is presented in Part 5 of the Manual of Steel Construc-
tion.
The structural members considered here are made of ASTM A3 6 steel having a yield-
point stress of 36,000 lb/in2 (248,220 kPa). (The yield-point stress is denoted by Fy in the
Specification.) All connections considered here are made with A141 hot-driven rivets or
fillet welds of A233 class E60 series electrodes.

From the Specification, the allowable stresses are as follows: Tensile stress in connect-
ed member, 22,000 lb/in2 (151,690.0 kPa); shearing stress in rivet, 15,000 lb/in2
(103,425.0 kPa); bearing stress on projected area of rivet, 48,500 lb/in2 (334,408.0 kPa);
stress on throat of fillet weld, 13,600 lb/in2 (93,772.0 kPa).
Let n denote the number of sixteenths included in the size of a fillet weld. For exam-
ple, for a 3/s-in (9.53-mm) weld, n = 6. Then weld size = «/16. And throat area per linear
inch of weld - 0.707«/16 - 0.0442« in2. Also, capacity of weld = 13,600(0.0442«) = 600«
Ib/lin in (108.0/1 N/mm).
As shown in Fig. 54, a rivet is said to be in single shear if the opposing forces tend to
shear the shank along one plane and in double shear if they tend to shear it along two
planes. The symbols Rss, Rds, and Rb are used here to designate the shearing capacity of a
rivet in single shear, the shearing capacity of a rivet in double shear, and the bearing ca-
pacity of a rivet, respectively, expressed in pounds (newtons).

CAPACITY OFA RIVET

Determine the values of Rss, Rds, and Rb for a %-in (19.05-mm) and 78-in (22.23-mm)
rivet.

Calculation Procedure:

1. Compute the cross-sectional area of the rivet

For the 3/4-in (19.05-mm) rivet, area = A = 0.785(0.75)2 = 0.4418 in2 (2.8505 cm2). Like-
wise, for the 7/8-in (22.23-mm) rivet, A = 0.785(0.875)2 = 0.6013 in2 (3.8796 cm2).

2. Compute the single and double shearing capacity of the rivet

Let t denote the thickness, in inches (millimeters) of the connected member, as shown in
Fig. 54. Multiply the stressed area by the allowable stress to determine the shearing ca-
pacity of the rivet. Thus, for the 34-in (19.05-mm) rivet, Rss, = 0.4418(15,000) - 6630 Ib
(29,490.2 N); R^ = 2(0.4418)(15,000) = 13,250 Ib (58,936.0 N). Note that the factor of 2
is used for a rivet in double shear.
Likewise, for the %-in (22.23-mm) rivet, ^55, = 0.6013(15,000) - 9020 Ib (40,121.0
N); Rds = 2(0.6013)(15,000) = 18,040 Ib (80,242.0 N).

3. Compute the rivet bearing capacity

The effective bearing area of a rivet of diameter d in (mm) = dt. Thus, for the %-in (19.05-
mm) rivet, Rb = 0.75^(48,500) = 36,38Or Ib (161,709* N). For the 7/8-in (22.23-mm) rivet,
Rb = 0.875^(48,500) = 42,44Or Ib (188,733* N). By substituting the value of tin either re-
lation, the numerical value of the bearing capacity could be obtained.

INVESTIGATION OFA LAP SPLICE

The hanger in Fig. 55a is spliced with nine %-in (19.05-mm) rivets in the manner shown.
Compute the load P that may be transmitted across the joint.

Calculation Procedure:

1. Compute the capacity of the joint in shear and bearing

There are three criteria to be considered: the shearing strength of the connection, the bear-
ing strength of the connection, and the tensile strength of the net section of the plate at
each row of rivets.
Since the load is concentric, assume that the load transmitted through each rivet is
1AP. As plate A (Fig. 55) deflects, it bears against the upper half of each rivet. Conse-
quently, the reaction of the rivet on plate A is exerted above the horizontal diametral plane
of the rivet.
Computing the capacity of the joint in shear and in bearing yields Pss = 9(6630) =
59,700 Ib (265,545.6 N); Pb = 9(36,380)(0.375) = 122,800 Ib (546,214.4 N).

Plate B

Plate A

FIGURE 55

2. Compute the tensile capacity of the plate

The tensile capacity Pt Ib (N) of plate A (Fig. 55) is required. In structural fabrication, riv-
et holes are usually punched %6 in (1.59 mm) larger than the rivet diameter. However, to
allow for damage to the adjacent metal caused by punching, the effective diameter of the
hole is considered to be 1A in (3.18 mm) larger than the rivet diameter.
Refer to Fig. 55&, c, and d. Equate the tensile stress at each row of rivets to 22,000
lb/in2 (151,690.0 kPa) to obtain Pt. Thus, at aa, residual tension = Pt net area = (9 -
0.875)(0.375) = 3.05 in2 (19.679 cm2). The stress s = P/3.05 = 22,000 lb/in2 (151,690.0
kPa); Pt = 67,100 Ib (298,460.0 N).
At bb, residual tension = %P, net area - (9 - 1.75)(0.375) - 2.72 in2 (17.549 cm2);
s = 8AP,/2.72 = 22,000; Pt = 67,300 Ib (299,350.0 N).
At cc, residual tension = 2AP, net area = (9 - 2.625)(0.375) = 2.39 in2 (15.420 cm2);
s = 2AP,/2.39 = 22,000; Pt = 78,900 Ib (350,947.0 N).

3. Select the lowest of the five computed values
as the allowable load

Thus, P = 59,700 Ib (265,545.6 N).

DESIGN OFA BUTT SPLICE

A tension member in the form of a 10 x Y2 in (254.0 x 12.7 mm) steel plate is to be spliced
with 7s-in (22.23-mm) rivets. Design a butt splice for the maximum load the member may
carry.

Calculation Procedure:

1. Establish the design load

In a butt splice, the load is transmitted from one member to another through two auxiliary
plates called cover, strap, or splice plates. The rivets are therefore in double shear.
Establish the design load, P Ib (N), by computing the allowable load at a cross section
having one rivet hole. Thus net area = (10 - 1)(0.5) = 4.5 in2 (29.03 cm2). Then P =
4.5(22,000) = 99,000 Ib (440,352.0 N).

2. Determine the number of rivets required

Applying the values of rivet capacity found in an earlier calculation procedure in this sec-
tion of the handbook, determine the number of rivets required. Thus, since the rivets are
in double shear, R* = 18,040 Ib (80,241.9 N); Rb = 42,440(0.5) = 21,220 Ib (94,386.6 N).
Then 99,000/18,040 = 5.5 rivets; use the next largest whole number, or 6 rivets.

3. Select a trial pattern for the rivets; investigate the tensile stress

Conduct this investigation of the tensile stress in the main plate at each row of rivets.
The trial pattern is shown in Fig. 56. The rivet spacing satisfies the requirements of the
AISC Specification. Record the calculations as shown:

Study of the above computations shows that the rivet pattern is satisfactory.
4. Design the splice plates
To the left of the centerline, each splice plate bears against the left half of the rivet. There-
fore, the entire load has been transmitted to the splice plates at cc, which is the critical
section. Thus the tension in splice plate = ^(99,00O) = 49,500 Ib (220,176.0 N); plate
thickness required = 49,500/[22,000(7)] = 0.321 in (8.153 mm). Make the splice plates
10 x 3/8 in (254.0 x 9.53 mm).

DESIGN OF A PIPE JOINT

A steel pipe 5 ft 6 in (1676.4 mm) in diameter must withstand a fluid pressure of
225 lb/in2 (1551.4 kPa). Design the pipe and the longitudinal lap splice, using 3/4-in
(19.05-mm) rivets.

Calculation Procedure:

1. Evaluate the hoop tension in the pipe

Let L denote the length (Fig. 57) of the repeating group of rivets. In this case, this equals
the rivet pitch. In Fig. 57, let T denote the hoop tension, in pounds (newtons), in the dis-
tance L. Evaluate the tension, using T = pDLI2, where/? = internal pressure, lb/in2 (kPa);
D = inside diameter of pipe, in (mm); L = length considered, in (mm). Thus, T =
225(66)Z/2 = 7425L

2. Determine the required
number of rows of rivets

Adopt, tentatively, the minimum allowable
pitch, which is 2 in (50.8 mm) for %-in
(19.05-mm) rivets. Then establish a feasible
rivet pitch. From an earlier calculation pro-
cedure in this section, Rss = 6630 Ib
(29,490.0 N). Then T= 7425(2) = 663Ow; n
= 2.24. Use the next largest whole number of
rows, or three rows of rivets. Also, Lmax =
3(6630)/7425 = 2.68 in (68.072 mm). Use a
21A-Ui (63.5-mm) pitch, as shown in Fig.
57a.
3. Determine the plate thickness

Establish the thickness t in (mm) of the steel
plates by equating the stress on the net sec- 
tion to its allowable value. Since the holes
will be drilled, take 13A6 in (20.64 mm) as
their diameter. Then T= 22,000^2.5 - 0.81)
- 7425(2.5); t = 0.50 in (12.7 mm); use 1X2-Hi
(12.7-mm) plates. Also, Rb = 36,380(0.5) >
6630 Ib (29,490.2 N). The rivet capacity is
therefore limited by shear, as assumed.

pute the shearing stress in each rivet.

1. Compute the polar moment of inertia of the rivet group

The moment causes the channel (Fig. 58) to rotate about the centroid of the rivet group
and thereby exert a tangential thrust on each rivet. This thrust is directly proportional to
the radial distance to the center of the rivet.
Establish coordinate axes through the centroid of the rivet group. Compute the polar
moment of inertia of the group with respect to an axis through its centroid, taking the
cross-sectional area of a rivet as unity. Thus, J= 2(*2 +y2) = 8(2.5)2 + 4(1.5)2 + 4(4.5)2 =
140 in2 (903.3 cm2).

2. Compute the radial distance to each rivet

Using the right-angle relationship, we see that T1 = r4 = (2.52 + 4.52)0 5 = 5.15 in (130.810
mm); r2 = r3 = (2.52 + 1.52)0 5 - 2.92 in (74.168 mm).

3. Compute the tangential thrust on each rivet

Use the relation / = MrIJ. Since M = 12,000(8) = 96,000 Ib-in (10,846.1 N-m),

(a) Moment on riveted

/i =/4 = 96,000(5.15)7140 = 3530 Ib (15,701.4 N); and/2 =/3 = 96,000(2.92)7140 = 2000
Ib (8896.0 N). The directions are shown in Fig. 586.

4. Compute the shearing stress

Using s = PIA9 we find S1=S4 = 3530/0.442 = 7990 lb/in2 (55,090 kPa); also, S2 = S3 =
2000/0.442 = 4520 lb/in2 (29,300 kPa).

5. Check the rivet forces

Check the rivet forces by summing their moments with respect to an axis through the cen-
troid. Thus M1=M4 = 3530(5.15) = 18,180 in-lb (2054.0 N-m); M2=M3 = 2000(2.92) =
5840in-lb (659.8 N-m). Then EM = 4(18,180) + 4(5840) = 96,080 in-lb (10,855.1 N-m).

ECCENTRIC LOAD ON RIVETED
CONNECTION

Calculate the maximum force exerted on a rivet in the connection shown in Fig. 59a.

Calculation Procedure:

1. Compute the effective eccentricity

To account implicitly for secondary effects associated with an eccentrically loaded con-
nection, the AISC Manual recommends replacing the true eccentricity with an effective
eccentricity.
To compute the effective eccentricity, use ee = ea

FIGURE 59

ment M in-lb (N-m). Thus, P = 15,000 Ib (66,720.0 N), M = 15,000(6) = 90,000 in-lb
(10,168.2 N-m).

3. Compute the polar moment of inertia of the rivet group

Compute the polar moment of inertia of the rivet group with respect to an axis through its
centroid. Thus, J = 2(*2 +/) = 6(3)2 + 4(4)2 = 118 in2 (761.3 cm2).

4. Resolve the tangential thrust on each rivet into its horizontal
and vertical components

Resolve the tangential thrust/ Ib (N) on each rivet caused by the moment into its horizon-
tal and vertical components. fx and fy, respectively. These forces are as follows: fx =
MyIJ and fy = MxIJ. Computing these forces for rivets 1 and 2 (Fig. 59) yields
fx = 90,000(4)7118 = 3050 Ib (13,566.4 N);£ = 90,000(3)7118 = 2290 Ib (10,185.9 N).

5. Compute the thrust on each rivet caused by the concentric load

This thrust isJ^ = 15,000/6 = 2500 Ib (11,120.0 N).

6. Combine the foregoing results to obtain the total force on the
rivets being considered

The total force F Ib (N) on rivets 1 and 2 is desired. Thus, Fx =fx = 3050 Ib (13,566.4 N);
Fy =fy +fy = 2290 + 2500 = 4790 Ib (21,305.9 N). Then F= [(305O)2 + (479O)2]0 5 = 5680
Ib (25,264.6 N).
The above six steps comprise method 1. A second way of solving this problem,
method 2, is presented below.
The total force on each rivet may also be found by locating the instantaneous center of
rotation associated with this eccentric load and treating the connection as if it were sub-
jected solely to a moment (Fig. 596).

7. Locate the instantaneous center of rotation

To locate this center, apply the relation h = J/(eeN), where N= total number of rivets and
the other relations are as given earlier. Then h = 118/[6(6)] = 3.28 in (83.31 m).

8. Compute the force on the rivets

Considering rivets 1 and 2, use the equation F = Mr'IJ, where rr = distance from the in-
stantaneous center of rotation O to the center of the given rivet, in. For rivets 1 and 2, r' =
7.45 in (189.230 mm). Then F = 90,000(7.45)7118 = 5680 Ib (25,264.6 N). The force on
rivet 1 has an action line normal to the radius OA.

DESIGN OF A WELDED LAP JOINT 

____

The 5-in (127.0-mm) leg of a 5 x 3 x % in (127.0 x 76.2 x 9.53 mm) angle is to be weld-
ed to a gusset plate, as shown in Fig. 60. The member will be subjected to repeated varia-
tion in stress. Design a suitable joint.

Calculation Procedure:

1. Determine the properties of the angle

In accordance with the AISC Specification, arrange the weld to have its centroidal axis
coincide with that of the member. Refer to the AISC Manual to obtain the properties of
the angle. Thus A = 2.86 in2 (18.453 cm2); yv = 1.70 in (43.2 mm); y2 = 5.00 - 1.70 = 3.30
in (83.820 mm).

2. Compute the design load and required weld length

The design load P Ib (N)^=As = 2.86(22,000) = 62,920 Ib (279,868.2 N). The AISC Spec-
ification restricts the weld size to 5/i6 in (7.94 mm). Hence, the weld capacity = 5(600)
3000 Ib/lin in (525,380.4 N/m); L = weld length, in (mm) = P/capacity, Ib/lin in =
62,920/3000 = 20.97 in (532.638 mm).

3. Compute the joint dimensions

In Fig. 60, set c = 5 in (127.0 mm), and compute a and b by applying the following equa-
tions: a = Ly2/w - c/2; b = Ly1Iw - c/2. Thus, a = (20.97 x 3.30)75 - 5A =11 .34 in
(288.036 mm); b = (20.97 x 1.70)75 - 5A = 4.63 in (117.602 mm). Make a = 11.5 in
(292.10 mm) and b = 5 in (127.0 mm).

ECCENTRIC LOAD ON A WELDED
CONNECTION

The bracket in Fig. 61 is connected to its support with a Vi-in (6.35-mm) fillet weld. De-
termine the maximum stress in the weld.

Calculation Procedure:

1. Locate the centroid of the
weld group

Refer to the previous eccentric-load cal-
culation procedure. This situation is anal-
ogous to that. Determine the stress by lo-
cating 
the 
instantaneous center of
rotation. The maximum stress occurs at A
and B (Fig. 61).
Considering the weld as concentrated
along the edge of the supported member,
locate the centroid of the weld group by
taking moments with respect to line aa.
Thus m = 2(4)(2)/(12 + 2 x 4) = 0.8 in
(20.32 mm).

2. Replace the eccentric load
with an equivalent concentric 
load and moment

Thus P = 13,500 Ib (60,048.0 N); M -
124,200 in-lb (14,032.1 N-m).

FIGURE 61

3. Compute the polar moment of inertia of the weld group

This moment should be computed with respect to an axis through the centroid of the
weld group. Thus Ix = (1/12)(12)3 + 2(4)(6)2 = 432 in3 (7080.5 cm3); / = 12(0.8)2 +
2(1/12)(4)3 + 2(4)(2 - 0.8)2 = 29.9 in3 (490.06 cm3). Then J = Ix + / = 461.9 in3
(7570.54 cm3).

4. Locate the instantaneous center of rotation O

This center is associated with this eccentric load by applying the equation h = J/(eL),
where e = eccentricity of load, in (mm), and L = total length of weld, in (mm). Thus, e =
10 - 0.8 = 9.2 in (233.68 mm); L =12 + 2(4) = 20 in (508.0 mm); then h = 461.9/[9.2(2O)]
= 2.51 in (63.754 mm).

5. Compute the force on the weld

Use the equation F = Mr'IJ, Ib/lin in (N/m), where r' = distance from the instantaneous
center of rotation to the given point, in (mm). AtA and B, r' = 8.28 in (210.312 mm); then
F= [124,200(8.28)]/461.9 = 2230 Ib/lin in (390,532.8 N/m).

6. Calculate the corresponding stress on the throat

Thus, S = PIA = 2230/[0.707(0.25)] = 12,600 lb/in2 (86,877.0 kPa), where the value 0.707
is the sine of 45°, the throat angle.

PART 2

STRUCTURAL STEEL DESIGN

Structural Steel Beams and Plate Girders

In the following calculation procedures, the design of steel members is executed in accor-
dance with the Specification for the Design, Fabrication and Erection of Structural Steel
for Buildings of the American Institute of Steel Construction. This specification is pre-
sented in the AISC Manual of Steel Construction.
Most allowable stresses are functions of the yield-point stress, denoted as Fy in the
Manual. The appendix of the Specification presents the allowable stresses associated with
each grade of structural steel together with tables intended to expedite the design. The
Commentary in the Specification explains the structural theory underlying the Specifica-
tion.
Unless otherwise noted, the structural members considered here are understood to be
made of ASTM A36 steel, having a yield-point stress of 36,000 lb/in2 (248,220.0 kPa).
The notational system used conforms with that adopted earlier, but it is augmented to
include the following: Aw = area of flange, in2 (cm2); Aw = area of web, in2 (cm2);
bf- width of flange, in (mm); d = depth of section, in (mm); dw - depth of web, in (mm);
tf= thickness of flange, in (mm). tw = thickness of web, in (mm); L' = unbraced length of
compression flange, in (mm); fy = yield-point stress, lb/in2 (kPa).

MOST ECONOMIC SECTION FOR A BEAM
WITHA CONTINUOUS LATERAL SUPPORT
UNDER A UNIFORM LOAD

A beam on a simple span of 30 ft (9.2 m) carries a uniform superimposed load of 1650
Ib/lin ft (24,079.9 N/m). The compression flange is laterally supported along its entire
length. Select the most economic section.

Calculation Procedure:

1. Compute the maximum bending moment and the required
section modulus

Assume that the beam weighs 50 Ib/lin ft (729.7 N/m) and satisfies the requirements of a
compact section as set forth in the Specification.
The maximum bending moment is M= (l/8)wL2 - (1/8)(1700)(30)2(12) = 2,295,000
in-lb (259,289.1 N-m).
Referring to the Specification shows that the allowable bending stress is 24,000 lb/in2
(165,480.0 kPa). Then S = MIf= 2,295,000/24,000 = 95.6 in3 (1566.88 cm3).

2. Select the most economic section

Refer to the AISC Manual, and select the most economic section. Use W l8 x 55 =

98.2 in3 (1609.50 cm3); section compact. The disparity between the assumed and actual
beam weight is negligible.
A second method for making this selection is shown below.

3. Calculate the total load on the member

Thus, the total load = W= 30(1700) = 51,000 Ib (226,848.0 N).

4. Select the most economic section

Refer to the tables of allowable uniform loads in the Manual, and select the most econom-
ic section. Thus use W18 x 55; fFallow = 52,000 Ib (231,296.0 N). The capacity of the
beam is therefore slightly greater than required.

MOST ECONOMIC SECTION FOR A BEAM
WITH INTERMITTENT LATERAL SUPPORT
UNDER UNIFORM LOAD

A beam on a simple span of 25 ft (7.6 m) carries a uniformly distributed load, including
the estimated weight of the beam, of 45 kips (200.2 kN). The member is laterally support-
ed at 5-ft (1.5-m) intervals. Select the most economic member (a) using A36 steel; (b) us-
ing A242 steel, having a yield-point stress of 50,000 lb/in2 (344,750.0 kPa) when the
thickness of the metal is 3A in (19.05 mm) or less.

Calculation Procedure:

1. Using the AISC allowable-load tables, select the most economic
member made of A36 steel

After a trial section has been selected, it is necessary to compare the unbraced length L' of
the compression flange with the properties Lc and Lu of that section in order to establish
the allowable bending stress. The variables are defined thus: L0 = maximum unbraced
length of the compression flange if the allowable bending stress = 0.66/J,, measured in ft
(m); L14 = maximum unbraced length of the compression flange, ft (m), if the allowable
bending stress is to equal 0.60/J,.
The values of L0 and Lu associated with each rolled section made of the indicated
grade of steel are recorded in the allowable-uniform-load tables of the AISC Manual. The
Lc value is established by applying the definition of a laterally supported member as pre-
sented in the Specification. The value of L14 is established by applying a formula given in
the Specification.
There are four conditions relating to the allowable stress:

Condition 

Allowable stress

Compact section: L' < Lc 
Compact section: L0 < L' < Lu 
Noncompact section: L' ^ Lu 
L' > Lu 

0.66/J,
0.60/J,
0.60/J,
Apply the Specification formula—use the larger value
obtained when the two formulas given are applied.

The values of allowable uniform load given in the AISC Manual apply to beams of

A3 6 steel satisfying the first or third condition above, depending on whether the section is
compact or noncompact.
Referring to the table in the Manual, we see that the most economic section made of
A36 steel is W16 x 45; PFallow = 46 kips (204.6 KN), where fFallow = allowable load on the
beam, kips (kN). Also, Lc = 7.6 > 5. Hence, the beam is acceptable.

2. Compute the equivalent load for a member of A242 steel

To apply the AISC Manual tables to choose a member of A242 steel, assume that the
shape selected will be compact. Transform the actual load to an equivalent load by apply-
ing the conversion factor 1.38, that is, the ratio of the allowable stresses. The conversion
factors are recorded in the Manual tables. Thus, equivalent load = 45/1.38 = 32.6 kips
(145.0 N).

3. Determine the highest satisfactory section

Enter the Manual allowable-load table with the load value computed in step 2, and select
the lightest section that appears to be satisfactory. Try W16 x 36; JPaiiow = 36 kips (160.1
N). However, this section is noncompact in A242 steel, and the equivalent load of 32.6
kips (145.0 N) is not valid for this section.

4. Revise the equivalent load

To determine whether the W16 x 36 will suffice, revise the equivalent load. Check the L11
value of this section in A242 steel. Then equivalent load = 45/1.25 = 36 kips (160.1 N),
Lu = 6.3 ft (1.92 m) > 5 ft (1.5 m); use W16 x 36.

5. Verify the second part of the design

To verify the second part of the design, calculate the bending stress in the W l6 x 36,
using S = 56.3 in3 (922.76 cm3) from 
the Manual. Thus M = (VS)WL =
(1/8)(45,000)(25)(12) = 1,688,000 in-lb (190,710.2 N -m ) ; /= MIS = 1,688,000/56.3 =
30,000 lb/in2 (206,850.0 KPa). This stress is acceptable.

DESIGN OF A BEAM WITH REDUCED
ALLOWABLE STRESS

The compression flange of the beam in Fig. Ia will be braced only at points A9 B, C, Z),
and E. Using AISC data, a designer has selected W21 x 55 section for the beam. Verify
the design.

Calculation Procedure:

1. Calculate the reactions; construct the shear
and bonding-moment diagrams

The results of this step are shown in Fig. 1.

2. Record the properties of the selected section

Using the AISC Manual, record the following properties of the 21WF55 section:
S= 109.7 in3 (1797.98 cm3); Iy = 44.0 in4 (1831.41 cm4); bf= 8.215 in (208.661 mm);
if = 0.522 in (13.258 mm); d = 20.80 in (528.32 mm); tw = 0.375 in (9.525 mm);
dlAf = 4.85/in (0.1909/mm); L0 = 8.9 ft (2.71 m); Lu = 9.4 ft (2.87 m).
Since L' > Lu, the allowable stress must be reduced in the manner prescribed in the
Manual.

3. Calculate the radius of gyration

Calculate the radius of gyration with respect to the y axis of a T section comprising the
compression flange and one-sixth the web, neglecting the area of the fillets. Referring to
Fig. 2, we see 4= 8.215(0.522) = 4.29 in2 (27.679 cm2); (1/6)4, = (1/6)(19.76)(0.375) =
1.24; AT = 5.53 in2 (35.680 cm2); IT = 0.5/y of the section = 22.0 in4 (915.70 cm4)-
r = (22.0/5.53)°5 = 1.99 in (50.546 mm).

4. Calculate the allowable
stress in each interval
between lateral supports

FIGURE 2. Dimensions of W21 x 55. 

By applying the provisions of the
Manual, calculate the allowable stress
in each interval between lateral sup-
ports, and compare this with the actual
stress. For A36 steel, the Manual for-
mula (4) reduces to fa = 22,000 -
0.679(Z//r)2/Q lb/in2 (kPa). By Manu-
al formula (S)J2 = 12,000,000/(L'd/4)
lb/in2 (kPa). Set the allowable stress
equal to the greater of these values.
For interval AB: L' = 8 ft (2.4 m) <
LC, /./aiiow = 24,000 lb/in2 (165,480.0
kPa); /max = 148,000(12X109.7 =
16,200 lb/in2 (111,699.0 IcPa)-this is
acceptable.
For interval BC: L'Ir = 15(12)/!.99
= 90.5; M1XAf2 = 95/(-148) =
-0.642; Cb = 1.75 - 1.05(-0.642) +
0.3(-0.642)2 - 2.55; /. set Cb = 2.3; /i = 22,000 - 0.679(90.5)2/2.3 = 19,600 lb/in2
(135,142.0 kPa);/2 = 12,000,000/[15(12)(4.85)] = 13,700 lb/in2 (94,461.5 kPa);/max =
16,200 < 19,600 lb/in2 (135,142.0 kPa). This is acceptable.
Interval CD: Since the maximum moment occurs within the interval rather than at a
boundary section, Q= 1; ZV r= 16.5(12)71.99 = 99.5;/; = 22,000-0.679(99.5)2= 15,300
lb/in2 (105,493.5 kPa);/2 = 12,OOO,000/[16.5(12)(4.85)] = 12,500 lb/in2 (86,187.5 kPa);
/max = 132,800(12)7109.7 = 14,500 < 15,300 lb/in2 (105,493.5 kPa). This stress is accept-
able.
Interval DE: The allowable stress is 24,000 lb/in2 (165,480.0 kPa), and the actual
stress is considerably below this value. The W21 x 55 is therefore satisfactory. Where de-
flection is the criterion, the member should be checked by using the Specification.

DESIGN OFA COVER-PLATED BEAM

Following the fabrication of a Wl 8 x 60 beam, a revision was made in the architectural
plans, and the member must now be designed to support the loads shown in Fig. 3a. Cov-
er plates are to be welded to both flanges to develop the required strength. Design these
plates and their connection to the W shape, using fillet welds of A233 class E60 series
electrodes. The member has continuous lateral support.

Calculation Procedure:

1. Construct the shear and bonding-moment diagrams

These are shown in Fig. 3. Also, ME = 340.3 ft-kips (461.44 kN-m).

2. Calculate the required section modulus, assuming the built-up
section will be compact

The section modulus S = MIf= 340.3(12)/24 = 170.2 in3 (2789.58 cm3).

(b) Shear diagram

(c) Bending-moment diagram

FIGURE 3

3. Record the properties of the beam section

Refer to the AISC Manual, and record the following properties for the Wl 8 x 60; d =
18.25 in (463.550 mm); bf= 7.56 in (192.024 mm); tf= 0.695 in (17.653 mm); / = 984 in4
(40.957 cm4); S= 107.8 in3 (1766.84 cm3).

4. Select a trial section

Apply the approximation A = 1.05(5- SWF)ldWF, where A = area of one cover plate, in2
(cm2); S = section modulus required, in3 (cm3); SWF = section modulus of wide-flange
shape, in3 (cm3); dwp = depth of wide-flange shape, in (mm). Then A = [1.05(170.2 -
107.8)]/18.25 = 3.59 in2 (23.163 cm2).
Try 10 x 3/8 in (254.0 x 9.5 mm) plates with.4 - 3.75 in2 (24.195 cm2). Since the beam
flange is 7.5 in (190.50 mm) wide, ample space is available to accommodate the welds.

5. Ascertain whether the assumed size of the cover plates
satisfies the AISC Specification

Using the appropriate AISC Manual section, we find 7.56/0.375 = 20.2 < 32, which is ac-
ceptable; 1X2( IO- 7.56)70.375 = 3.25 < 16, which is acceptable.

6. Test the adequacy of the trial section

Calculate the section modulus of the trial section. Referring to Fig. 40, we see /= 984 +
2(3.75)(9.31)2 - 1634 in4 (68,012.1 cm4); S = IIc= 1634/9.5 = 172.0 in3 (2819.08 cm3).
The reinforced section is therefore satisfactory.

7. Locate the points at which the cover plates are not needed

To locate the points at which the cover plates may theoretically be dispensed with, calcu-
late the moment capacity of the wide-flange shape alone. Thus, M=JS = 24(107.8)712 =
215.6 ft-kips (292.3 kN-m).

8. Locate the points at which the computed moment occurs

These points are F and G (Fig. 3). Thus, MF = 35.2^2 - 8O1 - 4) - 1X2(I^2
2) = 215.6;
y2 = 8.25 ft (2.515 m); M0 = 30.8j;2 - /2(1.2J2
2) = 215.6; y2 = 8.36 ft (2.548 m).
Alternatively, locate F by considering the area under the shear diagram between E and
F. Thus MF = 340.3 - 1X2(1.2y3
2) = 215.6; y3 = 14.42 ft (4.395 m); yi = 22.67 - 14.42 =
8.25 ft (2.515m).
For symmetry, center the cover plates about midspan, placing the theoretical cutoff
points at 8 ft 3 in (2.51 m) from each support.

9. Calculate the axial force in the cover plate

Calculate the axial force P Ib (N) in the cover plate at its end by computing the mean
bending stress. Determine the length of fillet weld required to transmit this force to the W
shape. Thus/mean = MyII= 215,600(12)(9.31)/1634 = 14,740 lb/in2 (101,632.3 kPa). Then
P = ^/mean = 3.75(14,740) = 55,280 Ib (245,885.4 N). Use a 1X4-Ui (6.35-mm) fillet weld,
which satisfies the requirements of the Specification. The capacity of the weld = 4(600) =
2400 Ib/lin in (420,304.3 N/m). Then the length L required for this weld is L =
55,280/2400 = 23.0 in (584.20 mm).

10. Extend the cover plates

In accordance with the Specification, extend the cover plates 20 in (508.0 mm) beyond
the theoretical cutoff point at each end, and supply a continuous /4-in fillet weld along
both edges in this extension. This requirement yields 40 in (1016.0 mm) of weld as com-
pared with the 23 in (584.2 mm) needed to develop the plate.

11. Calculate the horizontal shear flow at the inner surface
of the cover plate

Choose F or G, whichever is larger. Design the intermittent fillet weld to resist this shear
flow. Thus Vp = 35.2 - 8 - 1.2(8.25) - 17.3 kips (76.95 kN); V0 = -30.8 + 1.2(8.36) =
-20.8 kips (-92.51 kN). Then q = VQII = 20,800(3.75)(9.31)/1634 = 444 Ib/lin in
(77,756.3 N/m).
The Specification calls for a minimum weld length of 1.5 in (38.10 mm). Let s denote
the center-to-center spacing as governed by shear. Then s = 2(1.5)(2400)/444 = 16.2 in
(411.48 mm). However, the Specification 
imposes additional restrictions on the weld
spacing. To preclude the possibility of error in fabrication, provide an identical spacing at
the top and bottom. Thus, smax = 21(0.375) = 7.9 in (200.66 mm). Therefore, use a 1X4-Ui
(6.35-mm) fillet weld, 1.5 in (38.10 mm) long, 8 in (203.2 mm) on centers, as shown in
Fig. 4a.

DESIGN OFA CONTINUOUS BEAM

The beam in Fig. 5a is continuous from A to D and is laterally supported at 5-ft (1.5-m)
intervals. Design the member.

Calculation Procedure:

1. Find the bending moments at the interior supports; calculate
the reactions and construct shear and bending-moment diagrams

The maximum moments are +101.7 ft-kips (137.9 kN-m) and -130.2 ft-kips (176.55
kN-m).

2. Calculate the modified maximum moments

Calculate these moments in the manner prescribed in the AISC Specification. The clause
covering this calculation is based on the postelastic behavior of a continuous beam. (Refer
to a later calculation procedure for an analysis of this behavior.)
Modified maximum moments: +101.7 + 0.1(0.5)(115.9 + 130.2) = +114.0 ft-kips
(154.58 kN-m); 0.9(-130.2) - -117.2 ft-kips (-158.92 kN-m); design moment = 117.2
ft-kips (158.92 kN-m).

3. Select the beam size

Thus, S = MIf= 117.2(12)724 = 58.6 in3 (960.45 cm3). Use W16 x 40 with S = 64.4 in3
(1055.52 cm3); Lc = 7.6 ft (2.32 m).

SHEARING STRESS IN A BEAM-
EXACTMETHOD

Calculate the maximum shearing stress in a W l8 x 55 beam at a section where the verti-
cal shear is 70 kips (311.4 kN).

Calculation Procedure:

1. Record the relevant properties of the member

The shearing stress is a maximum at the centroidal axis and is given by v = VQI(If). The
static moment of the area above this axis is found by applying the properties of the WT9 x

27.5, which are presented in the AISC
Manual. Note that the T section consid-
ered is one-half the wide-flange section
being used. See Fig. 6.
The properties of these sections are Iw
= 890 in4 (37,044.6 cm4); AT = 8.10 in2
(52.261 cm2); tw = 0.39 in (9.906 mm);
ym = 9.06 - 2.16 = 6.90 in (175.26 mm).

2. Calculate the shearing 
stress at the centroidal axis

Substituting gives Q = 8.10(6.90) = 55.9
in3 (916.20 cm3); then v = 70,000(55.9)/
[890(0.39)] = 11,270 lb/in2 (77,706.7
kPa).

FIGURE 6

SHEARING STRESS IN A BEAM-
APPROXIMATE METHOD

Solve the previous calculation procedure, using the approximate method of determining
the shearing stress in a beam.

Calculation Procedure:

1. Assume that the vertical shear is resisted solely by the web

Consider the web as extending the full depth of the section and the shearing stress as uni-
form across the web. Compare the results obtained by the exact and the approximate
methods.

2. Compute the shear stress

Take the depth of the web as 18.12 in (460.248 mm), v = 70,000/[18.12(0.39)] = 9910
lb/in2 (68,329.45 kPa). Thus, the ratio of the computed stresses is 11,270/9910 =1 .14.
Since the error inherent in the approximate method is not unduly large, this method is
applied in assessing the shear capacity of a beam. The allowable shear V for each rolled
section is recorded in the allowable-uniform-load tables of the AISC Manual.
The design of a rolled section is governed by the shearing stress only in those in-
stances where the ratio of maximum shear to maximum moment is extraordinarily large.
This condition exists in a heavily loaded short-span beam and a beam that carries a large
concentrated load near its support.

MOMENT CAPACITY OF A WELDED
PLATE GIRDER

A welded plate girder is composed of a 66 x 3/8 in (1676.4 x 9.53 mm) web plate and two
20 x 3/4 in (508.0 x 19.05 mm) flange plates. The unbraced length of the compression
flange is 18 ft (5.5 m). If Cb = 1, what bending moment can this member resist?

Calculation Procedure:

1. Compute the properties of the section

The tables in the AISC Manual are helpful in calculating the moment of inertia. Thus Af
= 15 in2 (96.8 cm2); Aw = 24.75 in2 (159.687 cm2); / = 42,400 in4 (176.481 dm4); S =
1256 in3 (20,585.8 cm3).
For the T section comprising the flange and one-sixth the web, A = 15 + 4.13 = 19.13
in2 (123.427 cm2); then /= (1/12)(0.75)(20)3 = 500 in4 (2081.1 dm4); r = (500/19.13)05 =
5.11 in (129.794 mm); LYr = 18(12)75.11 =42.3.

2. Ascertain if the member satisfies the AISC Specification

Let h denote the clear distance between flanges, in (cm). Then: flange, ^(2O)A).75 = 13.3
< 16—this is acceptable; web, hltw = 66/0.375 = 176 < 320—this is acceptable.

3. Compute the allowable bending stress

Use /! = 22,000 - 0.679(1 Vr)2/Q, or fi = 22,000 - 0.679(42.3)2 = 20,800 lb/in2
(143,416.0 kPa); /2 = 12,000,000/(L'^) = 12,000,000(15)/[18(12)(67.5)] = 12,300
lb/in2 (84,808.5 kPa). Therefore, use 20,800 lb/in2 (143,416.0 kPa) because it is the larger
of the two stresses.

4. Reduce the allowable bending stress In accordance with the
AISC Specification

Using the equation given in the Manual yields /3 = 20,800(1 - 0.005(24.75/15)[176 -
24,000/(20,80O)0-5]} = 20,600 lb/in2 (142,037.0 kPa).

5. Determine the allowable bending moment

Use Af =/35 = 20.6(1256)712 = 2156 ft-kips (2923.5 kN-m).

ANALYSIS OFA RIVETED PLATE GIRDER

A plate girder is composed of one web plate 48 x 3/8 in (1219.2 x 9.53 mm); four flange
angles 6 x 4 x % in (152.4 x 101.6 x 19.05 mm); two cover plates 14 x y2 in (355.6 x 12.7
mm). The flange angles are set 48.5 in (1231.90 mm) back to back with their 6-in (152.4-
mm) legs outstanding; they are connected to the web plate by 7s-in (22.2-mm) rivets. If
the member has continuous lateral support, what bending moment may be applied? What
spacing of flange-to-web rivets is required in a panel where the vertical shear is 180 kips
(800.6 kN)?

Calculation Procedure:

1. Obtain the properties of the angles from the AISC Manual

Record the angle dimensions as shown in Fig. 7.

2. Check the cover plates for compliance with the
AISC Specification

The cover plates are found to comply with the pertinent sections of the Specification.

3. Compute the gross flange area and rivet-hole area

Ascertain whether the Specification requires a reduction in the flange area. Therefore
gross flange area = 2(6.94) + 7.0 = 20.88 in2 (134.718 cm2); area of rivet holes =
2C/2)(1)4(3/4)(1) = 4.00 in2 (25.808 cm2); allowable area of holes = 0.15(20.88) = 3.13.

5. Establish the allowable bending stress

Use the Specification. Thus h/tw = (48.5 - 8)70.375 < 24,000/(22,00O)0-5; /. 22,000 lb/in2
(151,690.0 kPa). Also, M= flic = 22(25,800)/[24.75(12)] = 1911 ft-kips (2591.3 kN-m).

6. Calculate the horizontal shear flow to be resisted

Here Q of flange = 13.88(23.17) + 7.0(24.50) - 0.87(23.88) = 472 in3 (7736.1 cm3); q =
VQII= 180,000(472)725,800 = 3290 Ib/lin in (576,167.2 N/m).
From a previous calculation procedure, Rds. = 18,040 Ib (80,241.9 N); Rb =
42,440(0.375) - 15,900 Ib (70,723.2 N); s = 15,900/3290 - 4.8 in (121.92 mm), where s =
allowable rivet spacing, in (mm). Therefore, use a 4%-in (120.65-mm) rivet pitch. This
satisfies the requirements of the Specification.
Note: To determine the allowable rivet spacing, divide the horizontal shear flow into
the rivet capacity.

DESIGN OF A WELDED PLATE GIRDER

A plate girder of welded construction is to support the loads shown in Fig. Sa. The dis-
tributed load will be applied to the top flange, thereby offering continuous lateral support.

FIGURE 8

At its ends, the girder will bear on masonry buttresses. The total depth of the girder is re-
stricted to approximately 70 in (1778.0 mm). Select the cross section, establish the spac-
ing of the transverse stiffeners, and design both the intermediate stiffeners and the bearing
stiffeners at the supports.

Calculation Procedure:

1. Construct the shear and bending-moment diagrams

These diagrams are shown in Fig. 8.

2. Choose the web-plate dimensions

Since the total depth is limited to about 70 in (1778.0 mm), use a 68-in (1727.2-mm) deep
web plate. Determine the plate thickness, using the Specification limits, which are a slen-
derness ratio hltw of 320. However, if an allowable bending stress of 22,000 lb/in2
(151,690.0 kPa) is to be maintained, the Specification 
imposes an upper limit of
24,0001(22,000)°5 = 162. Then tw = h/162 = 68/162 = 0.42 in (10.668 mm); use a 7/i6-in
(11.112-mm) plate. Hence, the area of the web Aw = 29.75 in2 (191.947 cm2).

3. Select the flange plates

Apply the approximation Af = McI(IJy1) - AJ6, where y = distance from the neutral axis
to the centroidal axis of the flange, in (mm).
Assume 1-in (25.4-mm) flange plates. Then Af = 4053(12)(35)/[2(22)(34.5)2] -
29.75/6 = 27.54 in2 (177.688 cm2). Try 22 x P/4 in (558.8 x 31.75 mm) plates with Af =
27.5 in2 (177.43 cm2). The width-thickness ratio of projection = 11/1.25 = 8.8 < 16. This
is acceptable.
Thus, the trial section will be one web plate 68 x 7/16 in (1727 x 11.11 mm); two flange
plates 22 x \% in (558.8 x 31.75 mm).

4. Test the adequacy of the trial section

For this test, compute the maximum flexural and shearing stresses. Thus, / =
(1/12)(0.438)(68)3 + 2(27.5)(34.63)2 = 77,440 in3 (1,269,241.6 cm3); / - McII =
4053(12)(35.25)/77,440 = 22.1 kips/in2 (152.38 MPa). This is acceptable. Also, v =
207/29.75 = 6.96 < 14.5 kips/in2 (99.98 MPa). This is acceptable. Hence, the trial section
is satisfactory.

5. Determine the distance of the stiffeners from the girder ends

Refer to Fig. 8d for the spacing of the intermediate stiffeners. Establish the length of the
end panel AE. The Specification stipulates that the smaller dimension of the end panel
shall not exceed 11,000(0.438)/(6960)05 = 57.8 < 68 in (1727.2 mm). Therefore, provide
stiffeners at 56 in (1422.4 mm) from the ends.

6. Ascertain whether additional intermediate stiffeners
are required

See whether stiffeners are required in the interval EB by applying the Specification crite-
ria.

Stiffeners are not required when h/tw < 260 and the shearing stress within the panel is
below the value given by either of two equations in the Specification, whichever equation
applies. Thus EB = 396 - (56 + 96) = 244 in (6197.6 mm); h/tw = 68/0.438 = 155 < 260;
this is acceptable. Also, a/h = 244/68 = 3.59.
In lieu of solving either of the equations given in the Specification, enter the table of
a/h, h/tw values given in the AISC Manual to obtain the allowable shear stress. Thus, with
a/h > 3 and h/tw = 155, ^allow = 3.45 kips/in2 (23.787 MPa) from the table.

At E, V= 207 - 4.67(4) = 188 kips (836.2 kN); v = 188/29.75 = 6.32 kips/in2
(43.576 MPa) > 3.45 kips/in2 (23.787 MPa); therefore, intermediate stiffeners are re-
quired in EB.

7. Provide stiffeners, and investigate the suitability of their
tentative spacing

Provide stiffeners at F, the center of EB. See whether this spacing satisfies the Specifica-
tion. Thus [260AMJ]2 = (260/155)2 = 2.81; a/h = 122/68 = 1.79 < 2.81. This is accept-
able.
Entering the table referred to in step 6 with a/h = 1.79 and hltw = 1 55 shows vallow =
7.85 > 6.32. This is acceptable.
Before we conclude that the stiffener spacing is satisfactory, it is necessary to investi-
gate the combined shearing and bending stress and the bearing stress in interval EB.

8. Analyze the combination of shearing and bending stress

This analysis should be made throughout EB in the light of the Specification require-
ments. The net effect is to reduce the allowable bending moment whenever V >
0.6Fallow. Thus, K81101, = 7.85(29.75) = 234 kips (1040.8 kN); and 0.6(234) = 140 kips
(622.7 kN).
In Fig. 86, locate the boundary section G where V= 140 kips (622.7 kN). The allow-
able moment must be reduced to the left of G. Thus, AG = (207 - 140)/4 = 16.75 ft (5.105
m); M0 = 2906 ft-kips (3940.5 kN-m); ME = 922 ft-kips (1250.2 kN-m). At G, Mallow =
4053 ft-kips (5495.8 kN-m). At £,/allow = [0.825 - 0.375(188/234)](36) = 18.9 kips/in2
(130.31 MPa); Mallow = 18.9(77,440)/[35.25(12)] = 3460 ft-kips (4691.8 kN-m).
In Fig. 8c, plot points E' and G' to represent the allowable moments and connect these
points with a straight line. In all instances, M< Mallow.

9. Use an alternative procedure, if desired

As an alternative procedure in step 8, establish the interval within which M > 0.75Mallow
and reduce the allowable shear in accordance with the equation given in the Specification.

10. Compare the bearing stress under the uniform load
with the allowable stress

The allowable stress given in the Specification fb allow = [5.5 + 4/(a//z)2]10,OOOAMJ2
kips/in2 (MPa), or, for this girder, fballow = (5.5 +' 4/1.792)10,000/1552 = 2.81 kips/in2
(19.374 MPa). Then fb = 4/[12(0.438)] = 0.76 kips/in2 (5.240 MPa). This is acceptable.
The stiffener spacing in interval EB is therefore satisfactory in all respects.

11. Investigate the need for transverse stiffeners
in the center interval

Considering the interval BC, V= 32 kips (142.3 kN); v = 1.08 kips/in2 (7.447 MPa); a/h =
192/68 = 2.82 « [260/(MJ]2-
The Manual table used in step 6 shows that z;allow > 1.08 kips/in2 (7.447 MPa);/6 allow =
(5.5 + 4/2.822)10,000/1552 = 2.49 kips/in2 (17.169 MPa) > 0.76 kips/in2 (5.240 MPa).
This is acceptable. Since all requirements are satisfied, stiffeners are not needed in inter-
val BC.

12. Design the intermediate stiffeners in accordance
with the Specification

For the interval EB, the preceding calculations yield these values: v = 6.32 kips/in2
(43.576 MPa); z;allow = 7.85 kips/in2 (54.125 MPa). Enter the table mentioned in step 6
with a/h = 1.79 and h/tw = 155 to obtain the percentage of web area, shown in italics in the
table. Thus, Ast required = 0.0745(29.75)(6.32/7.85) = 1.78 in2 (11.485 cm2). Try two
4 x 1/4 in (101.6 x 6.35 mm) plates; Ast = 2.0 in2 (12.90 cm2); width-thickness ratio =
4/0.25 = 16. This is acceptable. Also, (/*/50)4 = (68/5O)4 = 3.42 in4 (142.351 cm4);

/= (1/12)(0.25)(8.44)3 - 12.52 in4 (521.121 cm4) > 3.42 in4 (142.351 cm4). This is ac-
ceptable.
The stiffeners must be in intimate contact with the compression flange, but they may
terminate I3A in (44.45 mm) from the tension flange. The connection of the stiffeners to
the web must transmit the vertical shear specified in the Specification.

13. Design the bearing stiffeners at the supports

web plate

Use the directions given in the Specification. The stiffeners are considered to act in con-
junction with the tributary portion of the web to form a column section, as shown in Fig.
9. Thus, area of web = 5.25(0.438) = 2.30 in2 (14.839 cm2). Assume an allowable stress of
20 kips/in2 (137.9 MPa). Then, plate area required = 207/20 - 2.30 = 8.05 in2 (51.938
cm2).
Try two plates 10 x Y2 in (254.0 x 12.7
mm), and compute the column capacity of the
section. Thus, A = 2(10)(0.5) + 2.30 = 12.30
in2 (79.359 cm2); /= (1/12)(0.5)(20.44)3 - 356
in4 (1.4818 dm4); r = (356/12.30)°5 - 5.38 in
(136.652 mm); LIr = 0.75(68)/5.38 = 9.5.
Enter the table of slenderness ratio and al-
lowable stress in the Manual with the slender-
ness ratio of 9.5, and obtain an allowable stress
of 21.2 kips/in2 (146.17 MPa). Then / -
207/12.30 = 16.8 kips/in2 (115.84 MPa) < 21.2
kips/in2 (146.17 MPa). This is acceptable.
Compute the bearing stress in the stiffeners 
In computing the bearing area, assume that
each stiffener will he clipped 1 in (25.4 mm) to
clear the flange-to-web welding. Then / =
207/[2(9)(0.5)] = 23 kips/in2 (158.6 MPa). The
Specification provides an allowable stress of
33 kips/in2 (227.5 MPa).
The 1 0 x 1 /2 in (254.0 )( 12.7 mm) stiffeners at the supports are therefore satisfactory
with respect to both column action and bearing.

pIGURE 9 Effective column ^n

st iffener plate

Steel Columns and Tension Members

The general remarks appearing at the opening of the previous part apply to this part as
well.
A column is a compression member having a length that is very large in relation to its
lateral dimensions. The effective 
length of a column is the distance between adjacent
points of contraflexure in the buckled column or in the imaginary extension of the buck-
led column, as shown in Fig. 10. The column length is denoted by L, and the effective
length by KL. Recommended design values of K are given in the AISC Manual.
The capacity of a column is a function of its effective length and the properties of its
cross section. It therefore becomes necessary to formulate certain principles pertaining to
the properties of an area.
Consider that the moment of inertia / of an area is evaluated with respect to a group of
concurrent axes. There is a distinct value of/associated with each axis, as given by earli-

FIGURE 10. Effective column lengths. 

er equations in this section. The major axis
is the one for which 7 is maximum; the mi-
nor axis is the one for which / is minimum.
The major and minor axes are referred to
collectively as the principal axes.
With reference to the equation given
earlier, namely, Ix,, = Ix> cos2 0 + Iy> sin2 9 -
P^y sin 26, the orientation of the principal
axes relative to the given x' and y' axes is
found by differentiating Tx* with respect to
0, equating this derivative to zero, and
solving for 0 to obtain tan 20 = 2Px^y/
(7y-7,,), Fig. 15.
The following statements are corollar-
ies of this equation:
1. The principal axes through a given
point are mutually perpendicular, since
the two values of 0 that satisfy this
equation differ by 90°.
2. The product of inertia of an area with respect to its principal axes is zero.
3. Conversely, if the product of inertia of an area with respect to two mutually perpendi-
cular axes is zero, these are principal axes.
4. An axis of symmetry is a principal axis, for the product of inertia of the area with re-
spect to this axis and one perpendicular thereto is zero.
Let A1 and A2 denote two areas, both of which have a radius of gyration r with respect
to a given axis. The radius of gyration of their composite area is found in this manner: Ic =
I1 + I2 = A^2 + A2r2 = (Al+ A2)r2. But A1 + A2 = Ac. Substituting gives I0 = Awr2', there-
fore, rc = r.
This result illustrates the following principle: If the radii of gyration of several areas
with respect to a given axis are all equal, the radius of gyration of their composite area
equals that of the individual areas.
The equation Ix = 270 + 2,Ak2, when applied to a single area, becomes Ix -10 + Ak2.
Then Ar2. =

Since x and y are axes of symmetry, they are
the principal centroidal axes. However, it is
not readily apparent which of these is the mi-
nor axis, and so it is necessary to calculate
both rx and ry. The symbol r, without a sub-
script, is used to denote the minimum radius
of gyration, in inches (centimeters).
Using the AISC Manual, we see that the
channel properties are A = 11.70 in2 (75.488
cm2); h = 0.78 in (19.812 mm); T1 - 5.44 in
(138. 176 mm); r2 = 0.89 in (22.606 mm).

2. Evaluate the minimum radius 
of gyration of the built-up 
section; determine the
slenderness ratio

Thus, rx = 5.44 in (138.176 mm); ry =

3. Record the member area and computer rv

From the Manual, A = 3.61 in2 (23.291 cm2); ry = 1.56 in (39.624 mm); rz = 0.99 in
(25.146 mm); rv = (2 x 1.562 - 0.992)0-5 = 1.97 in (50.038 mm).

4. Determine the minimum radius of gyration of the built-up
section; compute the strut capacity

Thus, r = rp=l.91 in (50.038 mm); KLIr = 12(12)71.97 = 73. From the ManualJ= 16.12
kips/in2 (766.361 MPa). ThQnP = Af= 2(3.61)(16.12) = 116 kips (515.97 kN).

SECTION SELECTION FOR A COLUMN
WITH TWO EFFECTIVE LENGTHS

A 30-ft (9.2-m) long column is to carry a 200-kip (889.6-kN) load. The column will be
braced about both principal axes at top and bottom and braced about its minor axis at mid-
height. Architectural details restrict the member to a nominal depth of 8 in (203.2 mm).
Select a section of A242 steel by consulting the allowable-load tables in the AISC Manu-
al and then verify the design.

Calculation Procedure:

1. Select a column section

Refer to Fig. 13. The effective length with respect to the minor axis may be taken as 15 ft
(4.6 m). Then KxL = 30 ft (9.2 m) and KyL = 15 ft (4.6 m).
The allowable column loads recorded in the Manual tables are calculated on the prem-
ise that the column tends to buckle about the minor axis. In the present instance, however,
this premise is not necessarily valid. It is expedient for design purposes to conceive of a
uniform-strength column, i.e., one for which Kx and Ky bear the same ratio as rx and ry,
thereby endowing the column with an identical slenderness ratio with respecf to the two
principal axes.
Select a column section on the basis of the KyL value; record the value ofrjry of this
section. Using linear interpolation in the Manual Table shows that a W8 * 40 column has
a capacity of 200 kips (889.6 kN) when KyL = 15.3 ft (4.66 m); at the bottom of the table
it is found that rjry = 1.73.

2. Compute the value of KxL
associated with a uniform-
strength column, and compare
this with the actual value

Thus, KxL = 1.73(15.3) = 26.5 ft (8.1 m) <
30 ft (9.2 m). The section is therefore inade-
quate.

3. Try a specific column section
of larger size 

Trying W8 x 48, the capacity - 200 kips
(889.6 kN) when KyL 17.7 ft (5.39 m). For
uniform strength, KxL = 1.74(17.7) = 30.8 >
30 ft (9.39 m > 9.2 m). The W8 x 48 there-
fore appears to be satisfactory.

FIGURE 13

4. Verify the design

To verify the design, record the properties of this section and compute the slenderness ra-
tios. For this grade of steel and thickness of member, the yield-point stress is 50 kips/in2
(344.8 MPa), as given in the Manual. Thus, A = 14.11 in2 (91038 cm2); rx = 3.61 in
(91.694 mm); ry = 2.08 in (52.832 mm). Then KJLIrx = 30(12)73.61 - 100; KyLlry =
15(12)72.08-87.

5. Determine the allowable stress and member capacity

From the Manual, /= 14.71 kips/in2 (101.425 MPa) with a slenderness ratio of 100. Then
P = 14.11(14.71) = 208 kips (925.2 kN). Therefore, use W8 x 48 because the capacity of
the column exceeds the intended load.

STRESS IN COLUMN WITH PARTIAL
RESTRAINT AGAINST ROTATION

The beams shown in Fig. a are rigidly connected to a W14 x 95 column of 28-ft (8.5-
m) height that is pinned at its foundation. The column is held at its upper end by cross
bracing lying in a plane normal to the web. Compute the allowable axial stress in the col-
umn in the absence of bending stress.

Calculation Procedure:

1. Draw schematic diagrams to indicate the restraint conditions

Show these conditions in Fig. 146. The cross bracing prevents sidesway at the top solely
with respect to the minor axis, and the rigid beam-to-column connections afford partial
fixity with respect to the major axis.

2. Record the Ix values of the column and beams

3. Calculate the rigidity of the column relative to that
of the restraining members at top and bottom

Thus, IJL0 = 1064/28 = 38. At the top, ^(IJL^ = 2096/40 + 1478/30 = 101.7. At the top,
the rigidity G1 = 38/101.7 = 0.37.
In accordance with the instructions in the Manual, set the rigidity at the bottom Gb =

10.

4. Determine the value of Kx

Using the Manual alignment chart, determine that Kx=

2. Design the lacing bars

The lacing system must be capable of
transmitting an assumed transverse shear
equal to 2 percent of the axial load; this
shear is carried by two bars, one on each
side. A lacing bar is classified as a sec-
ondary member. To compute the trans-
verse shear, assume that the column will
be loaded to its capacity of 432 kips
(1921.5 N).
Then force per bar = 1/2(0.02)(432)
x (16.1/14) = 5.0 kips (22.24 N). Also, LIr
< 140; therefore, r = 16.1/140 = 0.115 in
(2.9210mm).
For a rectangular section of thickness
t, r ='0.289/. Then t = 0.115/0.289 = 0.40
in (10.160 mm). Set t = 7Ae in (11.11
mm); r = 0.127 in (3.226 mm); LIr =
16.1/0.127 = 127; / = 9.59 kips/in2
(66. 123 MPa); A = 5.0/9.59 = 0.52 in2
(3.355 cm2). From the Manual, the mini- 
mum width required for !/2-in (12.7 mm)
rivets = !!/2 in (38.1 mm). Therefore, use a
flat bar W2 x V16 in (38.1 x U .U mm);
A = 0.66 in2 (4.258 cm2).

FIGURE 15. Lacing and tie plates,

3. Design the end tie plates in accordance with the Specification

The minimum length = 14 in (355.6 mm); t = 14/50 = 0.28. Therefore, use plates 14 x 5/16
in (355.6 x 7.94 mm). The rivet pitch is limited to six diameters, or 3 in (76.2 mm).

SELECTION OFA COLUMN WITHA LOAD
ATAN INTERMEDIATE LEVEL

A column of 30-ft (9.2-m) length carries a load of 130 kips (578.2 kN) applied at the top
and a load of 56 kips (249.1 kN) applied to the web at midheight. Select an 8-in (203.2-
mm) column of A242 steel, using KxL = 30 ft (9.2 m) and KyL = 15 ft (4.6 m).

Calculation Procedure:

1. Compute the effective length of the column with respect
to the major axis

The following procedure affords a rational method of designing a column subjected to a
load applied at the top and another load applied approximately at the center. Let m = load
at intermediate level, kips per total load, kips (kilonewtons). Replace the factor K with a
factor K' defined by K' = K(I - w/2)05. Thus, for this column, m = 56/186 = 0.30. And
KxL = 30(1 - 0.15) °5 = 27.6 ft (8.41 m).

2. Select a trial section on the basis of the KyL value

From the AISC Manual for a W8 x 40, capacity = 186 kips (827.3 kN) when KjL = 16.2 ft
(4.94m) and rjry =1 .73.

3. Determine whether the selected section is acceptable

Compute the value OfKxL associated with a uniform-strength column, and compare this
with the actual effective length. Thus, KxL = 1.73(16.2) = 28.0 > 27.6 ft (8.41 m). There-
fore, the W8 x 40 is acceptable.

DESIGN OF AN AXIAL MEMBER

The effective length of the member is 11 ft (3.4 m). Design a double-angle member.

Calculation Procedure:

1. Calculate for each system the design load, and Indicate the
yield-point stress on which the allowable stress is based

The design of members subjected to a repeated variation of stress is regulated by the
AISC Specification, For each system, calculate the design load and indicate the yield-
point stress on which the allowable stress is based. Where the allowable stress is less than
that normally permitted, increase the design load proportionately to compensate for this
reduction. Let + denote tension and - denote compression. Then

2. Select a member for system A and determine if it is adequate
for system C

From the AISC Manual, try two angles 4 x y/2 x % hi (101.6 x 88.90 x 9.53 mm), with
long legs back to back; the capacity is 65 kips (289.1 kN). Then A = 5.34 in2 (34.453
cm2); r = rx = 1.25 in (31.750 mm); KLIr = 11(12)71.25 = 105.6.
From the Manual, for a yield-point stress of 33 kips/in2 (227.5 MP a ) , /= 11.76
kips/in2 (81.085 MPa). Then the capacity P = 5.34(11.76) = 62.8 kips (279.3 kN) > 57
kips (253.5 kN). This is acceptable. Therefore, use two angles 4 x 31/2 x % hi (101.6 x
88.90 x 9.53 mm), long legs back to back.

INVESTIGATION OFA BEAM COLUMN

A W l2 x 53 column with an effective length of 20 ft (6.1 m) is to carry an axial load of
160 kips (711.7 kN) and the end moments indicated in Fig. 16. The member will be se-
cured against sides way in both directions. Is the section adequate?

Calculation Procedure:

1. Record the properties of the section

The simultaneous set of values of axial stress and
bending stress must satisfy the inequalities set forth
in the AISC Specification.
The properties of the section are A = 15.59 in2
(100.586 cm2); Sx = 70.7 in3 (1158.77 cm3); rx = 5.23
in (132.842 mm); ry = 2.48 in (62.992 mm). Also,
from the Manual, Lc = 10.8 ft (3.29 m); Ln = 21.7 ft
(6.61 m).

2. Determine the stresses listed below/

The stresses that must be determined are the axial
stress fa; the bending stress fb; the axial stress F09
which would be permitted in the absence of bending;
and the bending stress Fb, which would be permitted
in the absence of axial load. Thus,/fl = 160/15.59 =
10.26 kips/in2 (70.742 MPa); /, = 31.5(12)770.7 = 
5.35 kips/in2 (36.888 MPa); KLIr = 240/2.48 = 96.8;
therefore, Fa = 13.38 kips/in2 (92.255 MPa); Lu < KL
< Lc; therefore, Fb = 22 kips/in2 (151.7 MPa). (Al-
though this consideration is irrelevant in the present instance, note that the Specification
establishes two maximum dlt ratios for a compact section. One applies to a beam, the oth-
er to a beam column.)

FIGURE 16. Beam column.

3. Calculate the moment coefficient C1n

Since the algebraic sign of the bending moment remains unchanged, M1IM2 is positive.
Thus, Cm = 0.6 + 0.4(15.2/31.5) = 0.793.

4. Apply the appropriate criteria to test the adequacy
of the section

Thus,/fl/Fa - 10.26/13.38 = 0.767 > 0.15. The following requirements therefore apply:
fJFa + [C1J(I -fJFi)]WFb) ^ l;/«/(0.6£) + ./i/F* < 1 where Fi = 149,000/(£Z>)2
kips/in2 and KL and r are evaluated with respect to the plane of bending.
Evaluating gives F'e = 149,000(5.23)2/2402 - 70.76 kips/in2 (487.890 MPa); faIF'e =
10.26/70.76 = 0145. Substituting in the first requirements equation yields 0.767 +
(0.793/0.855)(5.35/22) = 0.993. This is acceptable. Substituting in the second require-
ments equation, we find 10.26/22 + 5.35/22 = 0.709. This section is therefore satisfactory.

APPLICATION OF BEAM-COLUMN FACTORS

For the previous calculation procedure, investigate the adequacy of the Wl 2 x 53 section
by applying the values of the beam-column factors B and a given in the AISC Manual.

Calculation Procedure:

1. Record the basic values of the previous calculation procedure

The beam-column factors were devised in an effort to reduce the labor entailed in analyz-
ing a given member as a beam column whenfa/Fa > 0.15. They are defined by B = AIS per
inch (decimeter); a = 0.149 x 106/in4 (6201.9/dm4).
Let P denote the applied axial load and -Pauow the axial load that would be permitted in
the absence of bending. The equations given in the previous procedure may be trans-
formed to P + BMCm(Fa/Fb)a/[a - P(KL)2] < Pallow, and PFJQ.6fy) + BMFJFb < Pallow,
where KL, B9 and a are evaluated with respect to the plane of bending.
The basic values of the previous procedure are P = 160 kips (711.7 kN); M= 31.5
ft-kips (42.71 kN-m); Fb = 22 kips/in2 (151.7 MPa); Cm = 0.793.

2. Obtain the properties of the section

From the Manual for a W12 x 53, A = 15.59 in2 (100.587 cm2); Bx = 0.221 per inch (8.70
per meter); ax = 63.5 x 106 in4 (264.31 x 1Q3 dm4). Then when KL = 20 ft (6.1 m),Pallow =
209 kips (929.6 kN).

3. Substitute in the first transformed equation

Thus, F0 = Pallow/A = 209/15.59 = 13.41 kips/in2 (92.461 MPa), P(KL)2 = 160(24O)2 =
9.22 x 106 kip-in2 (2.648 x 104 kN-m2), and aj[ax - P(KL)2] = 63.57(63.5 - 9.22) =1 .17;
then 160 + 0.221(31.5)(12)(0.793)(13.41/22)(1.17) = 207 < 209 kips (929.6 kN). This is
acceptable.

4. Substitute in the second transformed equation

Thus, 160(13.41/22) + 0.221(31.5)(12)(13.41/22) = 148 < 209 kips (929.6 kN). This is
acceptable. The W l2 x 53 section is therefore satisfactory.

NET SECTION OF A TENSION MEMBER

The 7 x % in (177.8 x 6.35 mm) plate in Fig. 17 carries a tensile force of 18,000 Ib
(80,064.0 N) and is connected to its support with three 3/4-in (19.05-mm) rivets in the
manner shown. Compute the maximum tensile stress in the member.

Calculation Procedure:

1. Compute the net width
of the member at each section
of potential rupture

The AISC Specification prescribes the man-
ner of calculating the net section of a tension
member. The effective diameter of the holes
is considered to be Vs in (3.18 mm) greater
than that of the rivets.
After computing the net width of each
section, select the minimum value as the ef-
fective width. The Specification imposes an
upper limit of 85 percent of the gross width.
Refer to Fig. 17. From B to D9 s = 1.25 in
(31.750 mm), g = 2.5 in (63.50 mm); from D

FIGURE 17 

to F, s = 3 in (76.2 mm), g = 2.5 in (63.50 mm); WAC = 7- 0.875 = 6.12 in (155.45 mm);
WABDE = ? ~ 2(0.875) + 1.252/[4(2.5)] = 5.41 in (137.414 mm); WABDFG = 7 - 3(0.875) +
1.252/(4 x 2.5) + 32/(4 x 2.5) = 5.43 in (137.922 mm); wmax = 0.85(7) = 5.95 in (151.13
mm). Selecting the lowest value gives weff = 5.41 in (137.414 mm).

2. Compute the tensile stress on the effective net section

Thus,/= 18,000/[5.41(0.25)] - 13,300 lb/in2 (91,703.5 kPa).

DESIGN OF A DOUBLE-ANGLE
TENSION MEMBER

The bottom chord of a roof truss sustains a tensile force of 141 kps (627.2 kN). The mem-
ber will be spliced with %-in (19.05-mm) rivets as shown in Fig. 18a. Design a double-
angle member and specify the minimum rivet pitch.

Calculation Procedure:

1. Show one angle in its developed form

Cut the outstanding leg, and position it to be coplanar with the other one, as in Fig. ISb.
The gross width of the angle wg is the width of the equivalent plate thus formed; it equals
the sum of the legs of the angle less the thickness.

2. Determine the gross width in terms of the thickness

Assume tentatively that 2.5 rivet holes will be deducted to arrive at the net width. Express
wg in terms of the thickness t of each angle. Then net area required = 141/22 = 6.40 in2
(41.292 cm2); also, 2t(wg - 2.5 x 0.875) = 6.40; wg = 3.20// + 2.19.

3. Assign trial thickness values, and determine the gross width

Construct a tabulation of the computed values. Then select the most economical size of

The most economical member is the one with the least area. Therefore, use two angles 6 x

4. Record the standard gages

Refer to the Manual for the standard gages, and record the values shown in Fig. 186.

5. Establish the rivet pitch

Find the minimum value o f's to establish the rivet pitch. Thus, net width required =
'/2[6.40/(7/16M - 7.31 in (185.674 mm); gross width = 6 + 4 - 0.44 = 9.56 in (242.824

mm). Then 9.56 - 3(0.875) + s
For convenience, use the standard pitch of 3 in (76.2 mm). This results in a net width
of 7.29 in (185.166 mm); the deficiency is negligible.

Plastic Design of Steel Structures

Consider that a structure is subjected to a gradually increasing load until it collapses.
When the yield-point stress first appears, the structure is said to be in a state of initial
yielding. The load that exists when failure impends is termed the ultimate load.
In elastic design, a structure has been loaded to capacity when it attains initial yield-
ing, on the theory that plastic deformation would annul the utility of the structure. In plas-
tic design, on the other hand, it is recognized that a structure may be loaded beyond initial
yielding if:
1. The tendency of the fiber at the yield-point stress toward plastic deformation is resis-
ted by the adjacent fibers.
2. Those parts of the structure that remain in the elastic-stress range are capable of sup-
porting this incremental load.

The ultimate load is reached when these conditions cease to exist and thus the struc-
ture collapses.
Thus, elastic design is concerned with an allowable stress, which equals the yield-
point stress divided by an appropriate factor of safety. In contrast, plastic design is con-
cerned with an allowable load, which equals the ultimate load divided by an appropriate
factor called the load factor. In reality, however, the distinction between elastic and plas-
tic design has become rather blurred because specifications that ostensibly pertain to elas-
tic design make covert concessions to plastic behavior. Several of these are underscored
in the calculation procedures that follow.
In the plastic analysis of flexural members, the following simplifying assumptions are
made:
1. As the applied load is gradually increased, a state is eventually reached at which all
fibers at the section of maximum moment are stressed to the yield-point stress, in ei-
ther tension or compression. The section is then said to be in a state of plastification.
2. While plastification is proceeding at one section, the adjacent sections retain their lin-
ear-stress distribution.
Although the foregoing assumptions are fallacious, they introduce no appreciable
error.
When plastification is achieved at a given section, no additional bending stress may be
induced in any of its fibers, and the section is thus rendered impotent to resist any incre-
mental bending moment. As loading continues, the beam behaves as if it had been con-
structed with a hinge at the given section. Consequently, the beam is said to have devel-
oped a plastic hinge (in contradistinction to a true hinge) at the plastified section.
The yield moment My of a beam section is the bending moment associated with initial
yielding. The plastic moment Mp is the bending moment associated with plastification.
The plastic modulus Z of a beam section, which is analogous to the section modulus
used in elastic design, is defined by Z = MJf^ where/J, denotes the yield-point stress. The
shape factor SF is the ratio of Mp to My9 being so named because its value depends on the
shape of the section. Then SF = MJMy =fyZ/(fyS) = Z/S.
In the following calculation procedures, it is understood that the members are made of
A36 steel.

ALLOWABLE LOAD ON BAR SUPPORTED
BYRODS

A load is applied to a rigid bar that is symmetrically supported by three steel rods as
shown in Fig. 19. The cross-sectional areas of the rods are: rods A and C, 1.2 in2 (7.74
cm2); rod B, 1.0 in2 (6.45 cm2). Determine the maximum load that may be applied, (a) us-
ing elastic design with an allowable stress of 22,000 lb/in2 (151,690.0 kPa); (b) using
plastic design with a load factor of 1.85.

Calculation Procedure:

1. Express the relationships among the tensile stresses in the rods

The symmetric disposition causes the bar to deflect vertically without rotating, thereby
elongating the three rods by the same amount. As the first method of solving this prob-
lem, assume that the load is gradually increased from zero to its allowable value.

Expressing the relationships among the
tensile stresses, we have AL = sALA/E =
sBLB/E = SCLC

Thus, for a rectangle, C = bdfy/2, a = d/2, and
Mp = aC = bd2fyJ4. For a circle, C = m/%/8, a -
443TT), and Mp = aC = d3fy/6. For a W l6 x 40, C =
1X2( I l .77 in2) = 5.885^.
To locate the action lines, refer to the Manual

4. Explain the relative values of the shape factor

To explain the relative values of the shape factor, express the resisting moment con-
tributed by a given fiber at plastification and at initial yielding, and compare the results.
Let dA denote the area of the given fiber and y its distance from the neutral axis. At plas-
tification, dMp =fyydA. At initial yielding, f=fy

(b) Bending-moment diagram 

Using data from the AISC Manual,
we have Z = 89.6 in3 (1468.54 cm3).
Then Mp = fyZ = 36(89.6)712 = 268.8
ft-kips (364.49 kN-m).

2. Calculate the moment BD

Let P1 denote the applied load at com-
pletion of phase 1. In Fig. 2 Ib, con-
struct the bending-moment diagram
ADEC corresponding to this 
load.
Evaluate P1 by applying the equations
for case 14 in the AISC Manual Cal-
culate the moment BD. Thus, CE =
-ab(a + L)P1I(IL2) = -20(1O)(SO)P1/
[2(90O)] = - 268.8; P1 = 48.38
kips (215.194 kN); BD = ab\a +
2L)P1I(IL3) 
= 20(100X80X48.38)/
[2(27,00O)] - 143.3 ft-kips (194.31
kN-m),

3- Determine the
incremental load at
completion of phase 2

FIGURE 21 

Let P2 denote the incremental applied
load at completion of phase 2, i.e., the
actual load on the beam minus P1. In
Fig. 21 b, construct 
the bending-
moment diagram AFEC that exists when phase 2 terminates. Evaluate P2 by considering
the beam as simply supported. Thus, BF = 268.8 ft-kips (364.49 kN-m); DF =• 268 8 -
143.3 = 125.5 ft-kips (170.18 kN-m); but DF = obP2/L = 20(10)P2/30 - 125.5; P2 = 18.82
kips (8351 I kN ).

4. Sum the results to obtain the ultimate load

Thus, Pu = 48.38 + 18.82 - 67.20 kips (298.906 kN).

5. Construct the force and bending-moment diagrams
for the ultimate load

Part b: The following considerations are crucial: The bending-moment diagram always
has vertices at B and C, and formation of two plastic hinges will cause failure of the beam.
Therefore, the plastic moment occurs at B and C at impending failure. The sequence in
which the plastic hinges are formed at these sections is immaterial.
These diagrams are shown in Fig. 22. Express Mp in terms of P11, and evaluate Pa.
Thus, BF = 2QRA = 268.8; therefore, RA = 13.44 kips (59.781 kN). Also, CE = 3>ORA -
10PM = 30 x 13.44 - 10PM = -268.8; PM = 67.20 kips (298.906 kN).
Here is an alternative method: BF = (abPJL) - aMJL = M0, or 20(1O)P /30 =
50M/30;PM = 67.20 kips (298.906 kN).
This solution method used in part b is termed the static, or equilibrium, method. As
this solution demonstrates, it is unnecessary to trace the stress history of the member as it
passes through its successive phases, as was done in part a; the analysis can be confined
to the conditions that exist at impending failure. This procedure also illustrates the follow-
ing important characteristics of plastic design:
1. Plastic design is far simpler than elastic design.
2. Plastic design yields results that are much more reliable than those secured through

elastic design. For example, assume that the support at C does not completely in-
hibit rotation at that end. This departure from design conditions will invalidate the
elastic analysis but will in no way affect the plastic analysis.

DETERMINING THE ULTIMATE LOAD
BY THE MECHANISM METHOD

Use the mechanism method to solve the problem given in the previous calculation proce-
dure.

Calculation Procedure:

1. Indicate, in hyperbolic manner, the virtual displacement
of the member from its initial to a subsequent position

To the two phases of beam behavior previously considered, it is possible to add a third.
Consider that when the ultimate load is reached, the member is subjected to an incremen-
tal deflection. This will result in collapse, but the behavior of the member can be analyzed
during an infinitesimally small deflection from its stable position. This is termed a virtual
deflection, or displacement.
Since the member is incapable of supporting any load beyond that existing at comple-
tion of phase 2, this virtual deflection is not characterized by any change in bending
stress. Rotation therefore occurs solely at the real and plastic hinges. Thus, during phase

3, the member behaves as a mechanism (i.e., a constrained chain of pin-connected rigid
bodies, or links).
In Fig. 23, indicate, in hyperbolic manner, the virtual displacement of the member
from its initial position ABC to a subsequent position AB'C. Use dots to represent plastic
hinges. (The initial position may be represented by a straight line for simplicity because
the analysis is concerned solely with the deformation that occurs during phase 3.)

2. Express the linear
displacement under the load
and the angular displacement
at every plastic hinge

Use a convenient unit to express these dis-
placements. Thus, A = a0A = bSc; therefore,
ec = aBA/b = 26A; O8 = BA + 8C = 30A

3. Evaluate the external and
internal work associated with
the virtual displacement

FIGURE 23 

The work performed by a constant force
equals the product of the force and its dis-
placement parallel to its action line. Also,
the work performed by a constant moment
equals the product of the moment and its angular displacement. Work is a positive quanti-
ty when the displacement occurs in the direction of the force or moment. Thus, the exter-
nal work WE = PMA = P^BA = 20PUBA. And the internal work W1 = Mp(BB + Oc) = 5MpBA.

4. Equate the external and internal work to evaluate
the ultimate load

Thus, 2QP11OA = 5MP0A; Pu = (5/20)(268.8) = 67.20 kips (298.906 kN).
The solution method used here is also termed the virtual-work, or kinematic, method.

ANALYSIS OF A FIXED-END BEAM UNDER
CONCENTRATED LOAD

If the beam in the two previous calculation procedures is fixed at A as well as at C, what is
the ultimate load that may be applied at Bl

Calculation Procedure:

1. Determine when failure impends

When hinges form at A9 B, and C, failure impends. Repeat steps 3 and 4 of the previous
calculation procedure, modifying the calculations to reflect the revised conditions. Thus
WE = 2QPU0A; W1 = MP(8a +O8+ Oc) = 6MpOA; 20PU6A = 6MP6A; Pn = (6/20)(268.8) =
80.64 kips (358.687 kN).

2. Analyze the phases through which the member passes

This member passes through three phases until the ultimate load is reached. Initially, it
behaves as a beam fixed at both ends, then as a beam fixed at the left end only, and final-
ly as a simply supported beam. However, as already discussed, these considerations are
extraneous in plastic design.

ANALYSIS OFA TWO-SPAN BEAM
WITH CONCENTRATED LOADS

The continuous W l8 x 45 beam in Fig. 24 carries two equal concentrated loads having
the locations indicated. Disregarding the weight of the beam, compute the ultimate value
of these loads, using both the static and the mechanism method.

Calculation Procedure:

1. Construct the force and
banding-moment diagrams

FIGURE 24

The continuous beam becomes unsta-
ble when a plastic hinge forms at C and
at another section. The bending-mo- 
ment diagram has vertices at B and Z),
but it is not readily apparent at which of these sections the second hinge will form. The
answer is found by assuming a plastic hinge at B and at D, in turn, computing the corre-
sponding value of Pw and selecting the lesser value as the correct result. Part a will use
the static method; part 6, the mechanism method.
Assume, for part a, a plastic hinge at B and C. In Fig. 25, construct the force diagram and
bending-moment diagram for span A C. The moment diagram may be drawn in the manner
shown in Fig. 25b or c, whichever is preferred. In Fig. 25c, A CH represents the moments
that would exist in the absence of restraint at C, and A CJ represents, in absolute value, the
moments induced by this restraint. Compute the load P11 associated with the assumed hinge
location. From previous calculation procedures, Mp = 268.8 ft-kips (364.49 kN-m); then MB
= 14 x 16/V30 - 14M/30 = Mp; Pu = 44(268.8)7224 = 52.8 kips (234.85 kN).

2. Assume another hinge location and compute the ultimate load
associated with this location

Now assume a plastic hinge at C and D. In Fig. 25, construct the force diagram and bend-
ing-moment diagram for CE. Computing the load P11 associated with this assumed location,
we find MD = 12 x 24PM/36 - 24M/36 = Mp

3. Select the lesser value of the ultimate load

The correct result is the lesser of these alternative values, or P
At this load, plastic hinges exist at B and C but not at D.

 = 52.8 kips (234.85 kN).

SELECTION OF SIZES FOR
A CONTINUOUS BEAM

Using a load factor of 1.70, design the member to carry the working loads (with beam
weight included) shown in Fig. 21 a. The maximum length that can be transported is 60 ft
(18.3m).

Calculation Procedure:

1. Determine the ultimate loads to be supported

Since the member must be spliced, it will be economical to adopt the following design:
a. Use the particular beam size required for each portion, considering that the two por-
tions will fail simultaneously at ultimate load. Therefore, three plastic hinges will exist
at failure—one at the interior support and one in the interior of each span.
b. Extend one beam beyond the interior support, splicing the member at the point ofcon-
traflexure in the adjacent span. Since the maximum simple-span moment is greater for
AB than for BC, it is logical to assume that for economy the left beam rather than the
right one should overhang the support.
Multiply the working loads by the load factor to obtain the ultimate loads to be sup-
ported. Thus, w - 1.2 kips/lin ft (17.51 kN/m); w
 = 1.70(1.2) - 2.04 kips/lin ft (29.77
kN/m); P = IO kips (44.5 kN); P
 = 1.70(10) = 17 kips (75.6 kN).

5. Evaluate the maximum positive moment in the right span

Equate MB to the true plastic-moment capacity of the W21 x 55. Evaluate the maximum
positive moment ME in span BC, and locate the point of contraflexure. Therefore,
MB = -36(125.4)712 = -376.2 ft-kips (-510.13 kN-m); ME = 169.1 ft-kips (229.30 kN-m);
BF= 10.2 ft (3 .Um ).

6. Select a section to resist the plastic moment

The moment to be resisted is ME. Thus, Z = 169.1(12)736 = 56.4 in3(924.40 cm3). Use
W16 x 36 with Z= 63.9 in3 (1047.32 cm3).
The design is summarized in Fig. 27/ By inserting a hinge at F, the continuity of the
member is destroyed and its behavior is thereby modified under gradually increasing
load. However, the ultimate-load conditions, which constitute the only valid design crite-
ria, are not affected.

7. Alternatively, design the member with the right-hand beam
overhanging the support

Compare the two designs for economy. The latter design is summarized in Fig. 21 g. The
total beam weight associated with each scheme is as shown in the following table.

MECHANISM-METHOD ANALYSIS OF
A RECTANGULAR PORTAL FRAME

Calculate the plastic moment and the reactions at the supports at ultimate load of the
prismatic frame in Fig. 28a. Use a load factor of 1.85, and apply the mechanism
method.

Calculation Procedure:

1. Compute the ultimate loads to be resisted

There are three potential modes of failure to consider:
a. Failure of the beam BD through the formation of plastic hinges at B, C, and D (Fig.
286)
b. Failure by sidesway through the formation of plastic hinges at B and D (Fig. 28c)
c. A composite of the foregoing modes of failure, characterized by the formation of plas-
tic hinges at C and D
Since the true mode of failure is not readily discernible, it is necessary to analyze
each of the foregoing. The true mode of failure is the one that yields the highest value
O fM^.
Although the work quantities are positive, it is advantageous to supply each angular
displacement with an algebraic sign. A rotation is considered positive if the angle on the
interior side of the frame increases. The algebraic sum of the angular displacements must
equal zero.
Computing the ultimate loads to be resisted yields P11 = 1.85(40) = 74 kips (329.2 kN);
Qu = 1.85(12) = 22.2 kips (98.75 kN).

2. Assume the mode of failure in Fig. 2Bb and compute Mp

Thus, A1 - 10ft WE = 74(100) = 7400. Then indicate in a tabulation, such as that
shown here, where the plastic moment occurs. Include all significant sections for com-
pleteness.

Then 2MpO = 532.80; Mp = 266.4 ft-kips (361.24 kN-m).

4. Assume the composite mode of failure and compute Mp

Since this results from superposition of the two preceding modes, the angular displace-
ments and the external work may be obtained by adding the algebraic values previously
found. Thus, WE = 7400 + 532.80 1272.80. Then the tabulation is as shown:

Then 4M^0= 1272.80; Mp = 318.2 ft-kips (431.48 kN-m).

5. Select the highest value of Mp as the correct result

Thus, Mp = 318.2 ft-kips (431.48 kN-m). The structure fails through the formation of plas-
tic hinges at C and Z). That a hinge should ap-
pear at D rather than at B is plausible when it
is considered that the bending moments in-
duced by the two loads are of like sign at D
but of opposite sign at B.

6. Compute the reactions
at the supports

Draw a free-body diagram of the frame at ul-
timate load (Fig. 29). Compute the reactions
at the supports by applying the computed val-
ues of Mc and MD. Thus, ^ME = 2OF4 +
22.2(24) - 74(10) = O; VA = 10.36 kips
(46.081 kN); VE = 74 - 10.36 = 63.64 kips
(283.071 kN); Mc = 1OF4 + 24HA = 103.6 +
24HA = 318.2; HA = 8.94 kips (39.765 kN);
HE = 22.2 - 8.94 = 13.26 kips (58.980 kN);
M0 = -24HE = -24(13.26) - -318.2 ft-kips
(-431.48 kN-m). Thus, the results are veri-
fied.

ANALYSIS OFA RECTANGULAR PORTAL
FRAME BY THE STATIC METHOD

Compute the plastic moment of the frame in Fig. 28a by using the static method.

Calculation Procedure:

1. Determine the relative values of the bending moments

Consider a bending moment as positive if the fibers on the interior side of the neutral
plane are in tension. Consequently, as the mechanisms in Fig. 28 reveal, the algebraic
sign of the plastic moment at a given section agrees with that of its angular displacement
during collapse.
Determine the relative values of the bending moments at B, C, and D. Refer to Fig. 29.
As previously found by statics, VA = 10.36 kips (46.081 kN), M8 = 24HA, Mc = 24HA +
IQVA; therefore, MC = MB+ 103.6, Eq. a. Also, MD = 24HA + 20VA - 74(10); MD = MB-

5. Evaluate the internal work associated with each mechanism

Equate the external and internal work to find Mp. Thus, Mpl = 800/4 = 200; Mp2 =
300/2.25 - 133.3; Mp3 = 300/4 = 75; Mp4 = 1100/4.25 = 258.8; Mp5 = 600/4.25 = 141.2.
Equate the external and internal work to find Mp.

6. Select the highest value as the correct result

Thus, Mp = 258.8 ft-kips (350.93 kN-m). The frame fails through the formation of plastic
hinges at C and D.

7. Determine the reactions at ultimate load

To verify the foregoing solution, ascertain that the bending moment does not exceed Mp
in absolute value anywhere in the frame. Refer to Fig. 3Oa.
Thus, MD = -2QHE = -258.8; therefore, HE = 12.94 kips (57.557 KN); Mc = MD + \WE
= 258.8; therefore, VE = 51.76 kips (230.23 KN); then HA = 7.06 kips (31.403 KN); VA =
28.24 kips (125.612 KN).
Check the moments. Thus ^ME = 2OF4 + 5HA + 20(10) - 80(10) = O; this is correct.
Also, MF = 15HA = 105.9 ft-kips (143.60 kN-m) < Mp. This is correct. Last, MB = 25HA -
20(10) - -23.5 ft-kips (-31.87 kN-m)> -Mp. This is correct.

ANALYSIS OF GABLE FRAME
BY STATIC METHOD

The prismatic frame in Fig. 3Ia carries the ultimate loads shown. Determine the plastic
moment by applying the static method.

Calculation Procedure:

1. Compute the vertical shear VA and the bending moment
at every significant section, assuming HA = O

Thus, VA = 41 kips (182.4 KN). Then MB = O; Mc = 386; MD = 432; ME = 276;
MF = -100.
Note that failure of the frame will result from the formation of two plastic hinges. It is
helpful, therefore, to construct a "projected" bending-moment diagram as an aid in locat-
ing these hinges. The computed bending moments are used in plotting the projected bend-
ing-moment diagram.

2. Construct a projected bending-moment diagram

To construct this diagram, consider the rafter BD to be projected onto the plane of column
AB and the rafter FD to be projected onto the plane of column GF. Juxtapose the two
halves, as shown in Fig. 3 Ib. Plot the values calculated in step 1 to obtain the bending-
moment diagram corresponding to the assumed condition of HA = O.
The bending moments caused solely by a specific value of HA are represented by an
isosceles triangle with its vertex at Z)'. The true bending moments are obtained by super-
position. It is evident by inspection of the diagram that plastic hinges form at D and F and
that HA is directed to the right.

3. Evaluate the plastic moment

Apply the true moments at D and F. Thus, MD = Mp and MF = — Mp

THEOREM OF VIRTUAL DISPLACEMENTS

In Fig. 32a, point P is displaced along a virtual (infinitesimally small) circular arc PP'
centered at O and having a central angle 6. Derive expressions for the horizontal and ver-
tical displacement of P in terms of the given data. (These expressions are applied later in
analyzing a gable frame by the mechanism method.)

Calculation Procedure:

1. Construct the displacement diagram

In Fig. 326, let rh = length of horizontal projection of OP; rv = length of vertical projec-
tion of OP; A^ = horizontal displacement of P; Ay = vertical displacement of P.
In Fig. 32c, construct the displacement diagram. Since PP' is infinitesimally small, re-
place this circular arc with the straight line PP" that is tangent to the arc at P and therefore
normal to radius OP.

2. Evaluate Ah and Av, considering only absolute values

Since 6 is infinitesimally small, set PP" = rd; A^ = PP" sin a = rd sin a;

These results may be combined and expressed verbally thus: If a point is displaced
along a virtual circular arc, its displacement as projected on the u axis equals the displace-
ment angle times the length of the radius as projected on an axis normal to u.

GABLE-FRAME ANALYSIS BY USING
THE MECHANISM METHOD

For the frame in Fig. 3 Ia, assume that plastic hinges form at D and F. Calculate the plas-
tic moment associated with this assumed mode of failure by applying the mechanism
method.

Calculation Procedure:

1. Indicate the frame configuration following a virtual
displacement

During collapse, the frame consists of three rigid bodies: ABD, DF7 and GF. To evaluate
the external and internal work performed during a virtual displacement, it is necessary to
locate the instantaneous center of rotation of each body.
In Fig. 33 indicate by dash lines the configuration of the frame following a virtual dis-

FIGURE 33. Virtual displacement of frame.

placement. In Fig. 33, D is displaced to D' and F to F'. Draw a straight line through A and
D intersecting the prolongation of GF at H.
Since A is the center of rotation of ABD9 DD' is normal to AD and HD; since G is the
center of rotation of GF, FF' is normal to GF and HF. Therefore, H is the instantaneous
center of rotation of DF.

2. Record the pertinent dimensions and rotations

Record the dimensions a, b, and c in Fig. 33, and express S2 and O3 in terms of Q1. Thus,
O2IO1=HDIAD; :. O2 = O1. Also, O3IO1 = HFIGF = 49125; :. O3 = 1.96O1.

3. Determine the angular displacement, and evaluate the
internal work

Determine the angular displacement (in absolute value) at D and F, and evaluate the inter-
nal work in terms O f ^1. Thus, O0=O1-^O2 = 2O1; Op=O1-^O3 = 2.96O1. Then W1 = Mp (QD
+ Op) = 4.96MpO1.

4. Apply the theorem of virtual displacements to determine the
displacement of each applied load

Determine the displacement of each applied load in the direction of the load. Multiply the
displacement by the load to obtain the external work. Record the results as shown:

5. Equate the external and internal work to find Mp

Thus, 4.96MpO1 = 1160O1; Mp = 234 ft-kips (317.3 kN-m).
Other modes of failure may be assumed and the corresponding value of Mp computed
in the same manner. The failure mechanism analyzed in this procedure (plastic hinges at
D and F) yields the highest value ofMp and is therefore the true mechanism.

REDUCTION IN PLASTIC-MOMENT
CAPACITY CAUSED BYAXIAL FORCE

A W lO x 45 beam-column is subjected to an axial force of 84 kips (373.6 kN) at ultimate
load, (a) Applying the exact method, calculate the plastic moment this section can devel-
op with respect to the major axis, (b) Construct the interaction diagram for this section,
and then calculate the plastic moment by assuming a linear interaction relationship that
approximates the true relationship.

Calculation Procedure:

1. Record the relevant properties of the member

Let P = applied axial force, kips (kN); Py = axial force that would induce plastification if

FIGURE 34

acting alone, kips (kN) = Af J,; Mp = plastic-moment capacity of the section in combination
with P, ft-kips (kN-m).
A typical stress diagram for a beam-column at plastification is shown in Fig. 34a. To
simplify the calculations, resolve this diagram into the two parts shown at the right. This
procedure is tantamount to assuming that the axial load is resisted by a central core and
the moment by the outer segments of the section, although in reality they are jointly resis-
ted by the integral action of the entire section.
From the AISC Manual, for a WlO x 45: A = 13.24 in2 (85.424 cm2); d = 10.12 in
(257.048 mm); tf= 0.618 in (15.6972 mm); tw = 0.350 in (8.890 mm); dw = 10.12 -
2(0.618) = 8.884 in (225.6536 mm); Z= 55.0 in3 (901.45 cm3).

2. Assume that the central core that resists the 84-kip (373.6-kN)
load is encompassed within the web; determine the core depth

Calling the depth of the core g, refer to Fig. 34d. Then g = 84/[0.35(36)] = 6.67 < 8.884 in
(225.6536 mm).

3. Compute the plastic modulus of the core, the plastic modulus
of the remaining section, and the value of Mp

Using data from the Manual for the plastic modulus of a rectangle, we find Zc = 1At^g2 =
1/4(0.35)(6.67)2 = 3.9 in3 (63.92 cm3); Zr = 55.0 - 3.9 = 51.1 in3 (837.53 cm3); M'p =
51.1(36)7 12 = 153.3 ft-kips (207.87 kN-m). This constitutes the solution of part a. The
solution of part b is given in steps 4 through 6.

4. Assign a series of values to the parameter g, and compute the
corresponding sets of values of P and Mp

Apply the results to plot the interaction diagram in Fig. 35. This comprises the parabolic
curves CB and BA, where the points A, B, and C correspond to the conditions g = O, g =
dw, and g = d, respectively.

Structural Steel Buildings. Load and resistance factor design, or LRFD, has joined the old
allowable stress design (ASD) method as a recognized means for the design of structural
steel frameworks for buildings.
"Although ASD has enjoyed a long history of successful usage and is familiar to engi-
neers and architects, the author and most experts prefer LRFD because it is a truer repre-
sentation of the actual behavior of structural steel and unlike ASD, it can provide equiva-
lent margins of safety for all structures under all loading cond i t ions . . .. For these reasons
its anticipated that LRFD will replace ASD as the standard method of structural steel de-
sign."
The following selected procedures in this handbook cover structural steel design for
buildings using the load and resistance factor design (LRFD) method drawn from the ex-
cellent Rokach book listed above. And competent authorities on the LRFD method, listed
below, are cited frequently in the Rokach book, and in this handbook, usually in abbrevi-
ated form:

AISC: American Institute of Steel Construction, Inc., Chicago, IL.
AISC LRFD Specification'. Load and Resistance Factor Design Specification 
Structural Steel Buildings, published by AISC.
AISC LRFD Manual: Load and Resistance Factor Design Manual of Steel Construc-
tion, also published by AISC.

for

Equations in the following calculation procedures in this handbook are numbered as
follows. Those equations appearing in the AlSO LRFD Specification are accompanied by
their AISC numbers in parentheses, thus ( ); other equations are numbered in brackets,
thus [ ].
It is recommended that the designer have copies of both the AlSO LRFD Specification
and the AISC Manual on his or her desk when preparing any structural steel design using
the LRFD method. Both are available from the AISC at 1 E Wacker Dr, Suite 3100,
Chicago IL 60601.
Abraham J. Rokach writes, further, in his book cited above, "The ASD method is
characterized by the use of one judgemental factor of safety. A limiting stress (usually Fy)
is divided by a factor of safety (FS, determined by the authors of the Specification) to ar-
rive at an allowable stress

Allowable stress = Fy/FS

Actual stresses in a steel member are calculated by dividing forces or moments by the
appropriate section property (e.g. area or section modulus). The actual stresses are then
compared with the allowable stresses to ascertain that

Actual stress = allowable stress

No distinction is made among the various kinds of loads. Because of the greater vari-
ability and uncertainty of the live load and other loads in comparison with the dead load, a
uniform reliability for all structures is not possible.
" . .. Briefly, LRFD uses a different factor for each type of load and another factor for
the strength or resistance. Each factor is the result of a statistical study of the variability of
the subject quantity. Because the different factors reflect the degrees of uncertainty in the
various loads and the resistance, a uniform reliability is possible."

DETERMININGIFAGIVENBEAM

A designer plans to use a W6 x 15 and a W12 x 65 beam in (a) A6 steel (Fy = 36 ksi [248
MPa)], and (b) with Fy = 50 ksi [344.5 MPa]) and wishes to determine if the beams are
compact or non-compact.

Calculation Procedure:

For the W6 x 15 beam
1. Analyze the W6 x 15 beam

The structural section in Fig. 36a is used as a 40-ft (12.2-m) column. Its effective length

DETERMINING BEAM FLEXURAL DESIGN
STRENGTH FOR MINOR- AND MAJOR-AXIS
BENDING

For a simply supported W24 x 76 beam, laterally braced only at the supports, determine
the flexural design strength for (a) minor-axis bending and (Z?) major-axis bending. Use

the "Load Factor Design Selection Table for Beams" in Part 3 of the AISC LRFD
Manual

Calculation Procedure:

1. Determine if the beam is a compact section

The W24 x 75 is a compact section. This can be verified by noting that in the Properties
Tables in Part 1 of the AISC LRFD Manual both bf/2tfand hjtw for a W24 x 76 beam are
less than the respective flange and web values of

FIGURE 37

The case of no-stiffeners corresponds to k - 5.

2. Check the original assumptions for doubling the shear strength

To double the shear strength, I fc = 2 x 5 = 10. Then in AISC Equation A-G3-4,

*=5+cir10
This implies a/h = 1.0 or a= k; thus, the clear distance between transverse web stiffeners

Calculation Procedure:

1. Find the effective axial load for the beam-column

This procedure considers singly and doubly symmetric beam-columns: members subject-
ed combined axial compression and bending about one or both principal axes. The combi-
nation of compression with flexure may result from (either)

(a) A compressive force that is eccentric with respect to the centroidal axis of the
column, as in Fig. 42a
(b) A column subjected to lateral force or moment, as in Fig. 42b
(c) A beam transmitting wind or other axial forces, as in Fig. 42c

Simplified Second-Order Analysis
Second-order moments in beam-columns are the additional moments caused by the axial
compressive forces acting on a displaced structure. Normally, structural analysis is first-
order; that is, the everyday methods used in practice (whether done manually or by one of
the popular computer programs) assume the forces as acting on the original undeflected
structure. Second-order effects are neglected. To satisfy the AISC LRFD Specification,
second-order moments in beam-columns must be considered in their design.
Instead of rigorous second-order analysis, the AISC LRFD Specification presents a
simplified alternative method. The components of the total factored moment determined
from a first-order elastic analysis (neglecting secondary effects) are divided into two
groups, Mnt and Mlt.

1. Mnt—the required flexural strength in a member assuming there is no lateral transla-
tion of the structure. It includes the first-order moments resulting from the gravity
loads (i.e., dead and live loads), calculated manually or by computer.
2. Nit—the required flexural strength in a member due to lateral frame translation. In a
braced frame, Mlt = O. In an unbraced frame, Af/rincludes the moments from the lateral
loads. If both the frame and its vertical loads are symmetric, Mlt from the vertical loads
is zero. However, if either the vertical loads (i.e., dead and live loads) or the frame
geometry is asymmetric and the frame is not braced, lateral translation occurs and Af/,
=£ O. To determine Mn (a) apply fictitious horizontal reactions at each floor level to
prevent lateral translation and (b) use the reverse of these reactions as "sway forces" to
obtain Aflt. This procedure is illustrated in Fig. 43. As is indicated there, Mlt for an un-
braced frame is the sum of the moments due to the lateral loads and the "sway forces."

Once Mnt and Af/, have been obtained, they are multiplied by their respective magnifi-
cation factors, B1 and B29 and added to approximate the actual second-order factored mo-
ment M11.

M14 = B1Mn^B2M1, 

(Hl-2)

As shown in Fig. 44, B1 accounts for the secondary P - 8 effect in all frames (includ-
ing sway-inhibited), and B2 covers the P - A effect in unbraced frames. The analytical ex-
pressions for B1 and B2 follow.

Values of Pe are obtained from Eq. [8.1], considering the actual K and / of each column in

las for evaluating B2. The quantity A0,//, is the story drift index. Often, especially for tall
buildings, the maximum drift index is a design criterion. Using it in Eq. (H1-5) facilitates
the determination of B2.
For columns with biaxial bending in frames unbraced in both directions, two values of
BI (Bix and Bly) arc needed for each column and two values of B2 for each story, one for
each major direction. Once the appropriate B1 and B2 have been evaluated, Eq. (Hl-2) can
be used to determine M11x and Muy for the applicable interaction formula.

For a braced frame, K = 1.0 for design; KjLx = KyLy = 1.0 x 15 ft. Select a trial W14
shape using Eq. [8.2].

For a W14 with KL = 15 ft m = 1.0 and U= 1.5. Substituting in Eq. [8.2], we obtain

PUJB = 8°0 + 200 x 2.0 + O = 1200 kips (5338 kN)

In the AISC Column Load Tables (p. 2-19 of the LRFD Manual) if Fy = 36 ksi (248

2. Analyze the braced frame

Try a W14 x 159. To determine M11x (the second-order moment), use Eq. (H1-2).

ANALYZING A CONCRETE SLAB
FOR COMPOSITE ACTION

A W18 x 40 interior beam is shown in Fig. 47. Steel is A36, beam span is 30 ft O in (9.14
m), and beam spacing 10 ft O in (3.04 m). The beams are to act compositely with a 5-in
(12.7-cm) normal-weight concrete slab;/,' = 5.0 ksi (41.3 kN). Determine: (a) The effec-
tive width of concrete slab for composite action; (b) Vh (the total horizontal shear force to
be transferred) for full composite action; (c) The number of 0.75-in (1.9-cm) diameter
shear studs required if Fu = 60 ksi (413.4 kN).

Calculation Procedure:

1. Find the effective width of concrete slab for composite action

For an interior beam, the effective slab width on either side of the beam centerline is the
minimum of

-| - -^p = 3.75 ft = 45 in (114.3 cm)

I -iMIU 5.00 ft (1.52m)

The effective slab width is 2 x 45 in = 90 in (228.6 cm).

2. Determine the total horizontal shear force for full
composite action

In positive moment regions, Vh for full composite action is the smaller of

0.85/c'^c = 0.85 x 5 ksi x (90 in x 5 in)
= 1913 kips (8509 kN)

FIGURE 47

Afy = 11.8 in2 x 36 ksi = 425 kips (1890 kN)
Vh = 425 kips (189OkN)

3. Find the number of shear studs required

The nominal strength of a single shear stud [from Eq. (/5-7)] is

Qn = Q.5AscVftEc<AscFu

For a 3/4-in-diameter stud,

A*c = *( ^p1]2 = 0.44 in2 (2.84 cm2)

E0 = w1-5 V£ = 14515 VsiO = 3904 ksi (26,899 kNm)
Fn= 60ksi (413 kNm)
Qn = 0.5 x 0.44 in2 V5.0 ksi x 3904 ksi < 0.44 in2 x 60 ksi (413 kNm)
= 30.9 kips < 26.4 kips (117.4 kN)
= 26.4 kips per stud (117.4 kN per stud)

The number of shear connectors between the points of zero and maximum moments is

VH 

425 kips .. 

. J

W = ^ = ^^klpS/Stud

= 16.1 or 17 studs

For the beam shown in Fig. 48, the required number of shear studs is 2n = 2 x 17 = 34.
Assuming a single line of shear studs (over the beam web), stud spacing = 30.0 ft/34 =
0.88 ft = 10.6 in (26.9 cm). This is greater than the six-stud diameter [or 6 x % in = 4.5 in
(11.4 cm)] minimum spacing, and less than the eight slab thickness [or 8 x 5 in = 40 in
(101.6 cm)] maximum spacing, which is satisfactory.

DETERMINING THE DESIGN SHEAR
STRENGTH OFA BEAM WEB

The end of a W12 x 86 beam (A3 6 steel) has been prepared as shown in Fig. 49 for con-
nection to a supporting member. The three holes are 15/16 in (2.38 cm) in diameter for
7/8-in (2.22-cm)-diameter bolts. Determine the design shear strength of the beam web.

Calculation Procedure:

1. Find the applicable limit states

The applicable limit states are shear yielding, shear fracture, and block shear rupture. For

0^ = 0.90x0.64^

Avg = (I1X2 in2 x 3 in) x 0.515 in = 3.86 in2 (24.9 cm2)

Ans = (I1X2 in + 2 x 3 in x 21X2 x «/16) x 0.515 in = 2.66 in2 (17.2 cm2)

Ag = I1X2 in x 0.515 in = 0.77 in2 (4.96 cm2)

An = (I1X2 in - 

1X2 x 15X16 in) x 0.515 in = 0.53 in2 (3.42 cm2)

2. Determine the design shear strength

block shear rupture.

DESIGNING A BEARING PLATE FOR A BEAM
AND ITS END REACTION

The unstiffened end of a W21 x 62 beam in A3 6 steel rests on a concrete support (/,' = 3
ksi) [20.7 MPa], Fig. 50. Design a bearing plate for the beam and its (factored) end reac-
tion of 100 kips (444.8 kN). Assume the area of concrete support A2 = 6 x A1 (the area of
the bearing plate).

Calculation Procedure:

1. Find the bearing length

For the concentrated compressive reaction of 100 kips (444.8 kN) acting on the bottom
flange, the applicable limit states are (1) local web yielding and (2) web crippling. (It is
assumed that the beam is welded to the base plate and both are anchor-bolted to the con-
crete support. This should provide adequate lateral bracing to prevent sidesway web
buckling.)

Corresponding to the applicable limit states are Eqs. (Kl -3) and (Kl -5), each of which
has N9 the length of bearing, as a parameter.

where V'A2I1A1 < 2.
Substituting in Eq. [77.6], we obtain

Refer to Fig. 1 for the notational system. Let subscripts 1 and 2 refer to cross sections
through the body of the bar and through the center of the pin hole, respectively.
Eyebars are generally flame-cut from plates of high-strength steel. The design provi-

Bore

From the AISC Manual for A440 steel:
I ff < 0.75 in (19.1 mm), J^ = 50 kips/in2 (344.7
MPa).
If 0.75 < t < 1.5 in (38 mm), J^ = 46 kips/in2
(317.1 MPa).
If 1.5 < t < 4 in (102 TXXOL) Jy = 42 kips/in2 (289.5
MPa).

2. Design the body of the member,
using a trial thickness

The Specification restricts the ratio w/t to a value
of 8. Compute the capacity P of a % in (19.1-
mm) eyebar of maximum width. Thus w = 8(%) =
6 in (152 mm) ; /= 0.6(50) = 30 kips/in2 (206.8
MPa); P = 6(0.75)30 = 135 kips (600.5 kN). This
is not acceptable because the desired capacity is
175 kips (778.4 kN). Hence, the required thick-
ness exceeds the trial value of 3A in (19.1 mm).
with * greater than % in (19.1 mm), the allowable
stress at 1 is 0.60/;, or 0.60(46 kips/in2) = 27.6
kips/in2 (190.3 MPa); say 27.5 kips/in2 (189.6
MPa) for design use. At 2 the allowable stress is
0.45(46) = 20.7 kips/in2 (142.7 MPa), say 20.5
kips/in2 (141.3 MPa) for design purposes.
To determine the required area at 1, use the relation A1 = PIf, where/= allowable
stress as computed above. Thus, A1 = 175/27.5 = 6.36 in2 (4103 mm2). Use a plate 6l/2 x 1
in (165 x 25.4 mm) in which A1 = 6.5 in2 (4192 mm2).

3. Design the section through the pin hole

The AISC Specification limits the pin diameter to a minimum value of 7w/8. Select a pin
diameter of 6 in (152 mm). The bore will then be 6!/32 in (153 mm) diameter. The net
width required will be Pl(ft) = 175/[20.5(1.O)] = 8.54 in (217 mm); Dmin = 6.03 + 8.54 =
14.57 in (370 mm). Set D = 143A in (375 mm), A2 = 1.0(14.75 - 6.03) = 8.72 in2 (5626
mm2); A2IA1 = 1.34. This result is satisfactory, because the ratio OfA2SA1 must lie between
1.33 and 1.50.

4. Determine the transition radius r

In accordance with the Specification, set r = D = 14% in (374.7 mm).

ANALYSIS OFA STEEL HANGER

Calculation Procedure:

The plastic analysis of steel structures is developed in Sec. 1 of this handbook. Figure 2a
is the load diagram, and Fig. 2b is the stress diagram at plastification. The latter may be

Or, jc = 6 + 2.2 - [(6 + 2.2)2 - 2.2 x 12]°5 = 1.81 in (45.9 mm).

By Eq. 1, Pu = 36,000(0.50)(12 - 3.62) = 151,000 Ib (671.6 kN).

ANALYSIS OFA GUSSETPLATE

The gusset plate in Fig. 3 is 1^ in (12.7 mm) thick and connects three web members to the
bottom chord of a truss. The plate is subjected to the indicated ultimate forces, and trans-
fer of these forces from the web members to the plate is completed at section a-a. Investi-
gate the adequacy of this plate. Use 18,000 lb/in2 (124.1 MPa) as the yield-point stress in

FIGURE 3. Gusset plate

shear, and disregard interaction of direct stress and shearing stress in computing the ulti-
mate-load and ultimate-moment capacity.

Calculation Procedure:

1. Resolve the diagonal forces into their horizontal
and vertical components

Let Hu and V11 denote the ultimate shearing force on a horizontal and vertical plane, re-
spectively. Resolving the diagonal forces into their horizontal and vertical components
gives (42 + 52)05 = 6.40. Horizontal components: 150(4/6.40) = 93.7 kips (416.8 kN);
110(4/6.40) = 68.7 kips (305.6 kN). Vertical components: 150(5/6.40) = 117.1 kips
(520.9 kN); 110(5/6.40) = 85.9 kips (382.1 kN).

2. Check the force system for equilibrium

Thus, ^Fn= 206.0 - 43.6 - 93.7 - 68.7 = O; this is satisfactory, as is 2F> = 117.1 - 85.9
-31.2 = 0.

3. Compare the ultimate shear at section a-a with the
allowable value

Thus, Hn = 206.0 - 43.6 = 162.4 kips (722.4 kN). To compute Hn^ assume that the
shearing stress is equal to the yield-point stress across the entire section. Then Hu>allow =
24(0.5)(18) = 216 kips (960.8 kN). This is satisfactory.

4. Compare the ultimate shear at section b-b with the
allowable value

Thus, Vn = 117.1 kips (520.9 kN); Fw?allow = 18(0.5)(18) = 162 kips (720.6 kN). This is sat-
isfactory.

5. Compare the ultimate moment at section a-a with the
plastic moment

Thus, cd = 4(6)/5 = 4.8 in (122 mm); Mn = 4.8(117.1 + 85.9) = 974 in-kips (110.1 kN-m).
Or, Mn = 6(206 - 43.6) = 974 in-kips (110.1 kN-m). To find the plastic moment Mp, use

the relation Mu =fybd2/4, or Mp = 36(0.5)(24)2/4 = 2592 in-kips (292.9 kN-m). This is sat-
isfactory.

6. Compare the ultimate direct force at section b-b
with the allowable value

Thus, Pn = 93.7 + 43.6 = 137.3 kips (610.7 kN); or Pn = 206.0 - 68.7 = 137.3 kips (610.7
kN); e = 9 - 2 = 7 in (177.8 mm). By Eq. 2, x = 9 + 1 - [(9 + 7)2 - 7 x 18]°-5 = 4.6 in
(116.8 mm). By Eq. 1,

Figure 4b indicates the assumed deformation of the upper angle, A being the point of
contraflexure in the vertical leg. Since the true stress distribution cannot be readily ascer-
tained, it is necessary to make simplifying assumptions. The following equations evolve
from a conservative analysis of the member: c = 0.6«; T2 = T1(I + 3a/4b).
Study shows that use of an angle having two rows of bolts in the vertical leg would be
unsatisfactory because the bolts in the outer row would remain inactive until those in the
inner row yielded. If the two rows of bolts are required, the flange should be connected by
means of a tee rather than an angle.
The following notational system will be used with reference to the beam dimensions:
b = flange width; d = beam depth; tf = flange thickness; tf = web thickness.
Record the relevant properties of the W14 x 38; d = 14.12 in (359 mm); tf = 0.513 in
(13 mm). (Obtain these properties from a table of structural-shape data.)

2. Establish the capacity of the shop rivets and field bolts used
in transmitting the moment

From the AISC Specification, the rivet capacity in single shear = 0.6013(15) = 9.02 kips
(40.1 kN); rivet capacity in bearing 0.875(0.513)(48.5) = 21.77 kips (96.8 kN); bolt ca-
pacity in tension = 0.6013(40) = 24.05 kips (106.9 kN).

3. Determine the number of rivets required in each beam flange

Thus, T1 = moment/d= 315/14.12 = 22.31 kips (99.7 kN); number of rivets = T1MvCt ca-
pacity in single shear = 22.31/9.02 = 2.5; use four rivets, the next highest even number.

4. Assuming tentatively that one row of field bolts will suffice,
design the flange angle

Try an angle 8 x 4 x % hi (203 x 102 x 19 mm), 8 in (203 mm) long, having a standard
gage of 2V2 in (63.5 mm) in the vertical leg. Compute the maximum bending moment M
in this leg. Thus, c = 0.6(2.5 - 0.75) = 1.05 in (26.7 mm); M = T1C = 23.43 in-kips
(2.65 kN-m). Then apply the relation / = MIS to find the flexural stress. Or,
/= 23.43/[(V6)(S)(OJS)2] - 31.24 kips/in2 (215.4 MPa).
Since the cross section is rectangular, the allowable stress is 27 kips/in2 (186.1 MPa),
as given by the AISC Specification. (The justification for allowing a higher flexural stress
in a member of rectangular cross section as compared with a wide-flange member is pre-
sented in Sec. 1.)
Try a %-in (22-mm) angle, with c = 0.975 in (24.8 mm); M = 21.75 in-kips (2.46
kN-m);/= 21.75/(1X6)(S)(O-STS)2 - 21.3 kips/in2 (146.8 MPa). This is an acceptable stress.

5. Check the adequacy of the two field bolts in each angle

Thus, T2 = 22.31[1 + 3 x 1.625/(4 x 1.5)] = 40.44 kips (179.9 kN); the capacity of two
bolts = 2(24.05) = 48.10 kips (213.9 kN). Hence the bolts are acceptable because their ca-
pacity exceeds the load.

6. Summarize the design

Use angles 8 x 4 x % in (203 x 102 x 19 mm), 8 in (203 mm) long. In each angle, use four
rivets for the beam connection and two bolts for the column connection. For transmitting
the shear, the standard web connection for a 14-in (356-mm) beam shown in the AISC
Manual is satisfactory

RIVETED MOMENT CONNECTION

A W l8 x 60 beam frames to the flange of a column and transmits a shear of 40 kips
(177.9 kN) and a moment of 2500 in-kips (282.5 kN-m). Design the connection, using
%-in (22-mm) diameter rivets of A141 steel for both the shop and field connections.

Calculation Procedure:

1. Record the relevant properties of the W18 x 6O

The connection is shown in Fig. 5a. Referring to the row of rivets in Fig. Sb9 consider that
there are n rivets having a uniform spacing/?. The moment of inertia and section modulus
of this rivet group with respect to its horizontal centroidal axis are

/.^..^i s-e^l 

p,

Record the properties of the W18 x 60: d = 18.25 in (463.6 mm); b = 7.558 in (192
mm); &= 1.18 in (30.0 mm); tf = 0.695 in (17.7 mm); tw = 0.416 in (10.6 mm).

2. Establish the capacity of a rivet

Thus: single shear, 9.02 kips (40.1 kN); double shear, 18.04 kips (80.2 kN); bearing on
beam web, 0.875(0.416)(48.5) = 17.65 kips (78.5 kN).

3. Determine the number of rivets required on line 1 as governed
by the rivet capacity

Try 15 rivets having the indicated disposition. Apply Eq. 3 with n = 11; then make the
necessary correction. Thus, /= 9(17)(172 - 1)/12 - 2(9)2 = 3510 in2 (22,645 cm2)- S =
3510/24 = 146.3 in (3716 mm).
Let F denote the force on a rivet, and let the subscripts x and y denote the horizontal

FIGURE 5. Riveted moment connection.

and vertical components, respectively. Thus, Fx = MfS = 2500/146.3 = 17.09 kips
(76.0 kN); Fy = 40/15 = 2.67 kips (11.9 kN); F = (17.092 + 2.672)05 = 17.30 < 17.65.
Therefore, this is acceptable.

4. Compute the stresses in the web plate at line 1

The plate is considered continuous; the rivet holes are assumed to be 1 in (25.4 mm) in di-
ameter for the reasons explained earlier.
The total depth of the plate is 51 in (1295.4 mm), the area and moment of inertia of the
net section are An = 0.416(51 - 1 5 x 1 )= 14.98 in2 (96.6 cm2) and/,, = (1/12)(0.416)(51)3
- 1.0(0.416)(3510) = 3138 in4 (130,603.6 cm4).
Apply the general shear equation. Since the section is rectangular, the maximum
shearing stress is v = 1.5VIAn = 1.5(40)714.98 = 4.0 kips/in2 (27.6 MPa). The AISC Speci-
fication gives an allowable stress of 14.5 kips/in2 (99.9 MPa).
The maximum flexural stress i s /= McIIn = 2500(25.5)13138 = 20.3 < 27 kips/in2
(186.1 MPa). This is acceptable. The use of 15 rivets is therefore satisfactory.

5. Compute the stresses in the rivets on line 2

The center of rotation of the angles cannot be readily located because it depends on the
amount of initial tension to which the rivets are subjected. For a conservative approxima-
tion, assume that the center of rotation of the angles coincides with the horizontal cen-
troidal axis of the rivet group. The forces are Fx = 2500/[2(146.3)] = 8.54 kips (37.9 kN);
Fy = 40/30 =1 .33 kips (5.9 kN). The corresponding stresses in tension and shear are st =
FyIA = 8.54/0.6013 = 14.20 kips/in2 (97.9 MPa); ss = Fy/A = 1.33/0.6013 = 2.21 kips/in2
(15.2 MPa). The Specification gives ^allow = 28 - 1.6(2.21) > 20 kips/in2 (137.9 kPa).
This is acceptable.

6. Select the size of the connection angles

The angles are designed by assuming a uniform bending stress across a distance equal to
the spacing p of the rivets; the maximum stress is found by applying the tensile force on
the extreme rivet.
Try 4 x 4 x 3/4 in (102 x 102 x 19 mm) angles, with a standard gage of 21X2 in (63.5
mm) in the outstanding legs. Assuming the point of contraflexure to have the location
specified in the previous calculation procedure, we get c = 0.6(2.5 - 0.75) = 1.05 in (26.7
mm); M= 8.54(1.05) = 8.97 in-kips (1.0 kN -m ) ; /= 8.97/[(1/6)(3)(0.75)2] = 31.9 > 27
kips/in2 (186.1 MPa). Use 5 x 5 x % in (127 x 127 x 22 mm) angles, with a 21X2-Ui (63.5-
mm) gage in the outstanding legs.

7. Determine the number of rivets required on line 3

The forces in the rivets above this line are shown in Fig 6a. The resultant forces are

Top of beam

FIGURE 6

#=64 .11 kips (285.2 kN); F = 13.35 kips (59.4 kN). Let M3 denote the moment of H
with respect to line 3. Then a = Y2(24 - 18.25) = 2.88 in (73.2 mm); M3 = 633.3 in-kips
(71.6 kN-m).
With reference to Fig. 66, the tensile force Fy in the rivet is usually limited by the
bending capacity of beam flange. As shown in the AISC Manual, the standard gage in the
W l8 x 60 is 3Vz in (88.9 mm). Assume that the point of contraflexure in the beam flange
lies midway between the center of the rivet and the face of the web. Referring to Fig. 4Z>,
we have c = V2(LlS - 0.416/2) = 0.771 in (19.6 mm); Mallow =fS = 27(Y6)(3)(0.695)2 -
0.52 in-kips (0.74 kN-m). If the compressive force C is disregarded, Fy allow = 6.52/0.771 =
8 46 kips (37 6 kN)
Try 16 rivets. The moment on the rivet group is M= 633.3 - 13.35(14.5) = 440 in-kips
(49.7 kN-m). By Eq. 3, S = 2(3)(8)(9)/6 = 72 in (1829 mm). Also, Fy = 440/72 + 13.35/16
= 6.94 < 8.46 kips (37.6 kN). This is acceptable. (The value of Fy corresponding to 14 riv-
ets is excessive.)
The rivet stresses are st = 6.94/0.6013 = 11.54 kips/in2 (79.6 MPa); ss =
64.1 !/[16(0.6013)] = 6.67 kips/in2 (45.9 MPa). From the Specification, shallow = 28 -
1.6(6.67) = 17.33 kips/in2 (119.5 MPa). This is acceptable. The use of 16 rivets is there-
fore satisfactory.

8. Compute the stresses in the bracket at the toe of the fillet
(line 4)

Since these stresses are seldom critical, take the length of the bracket as 24 in (609.6 mm)
and disregard the eccentricity of V. Then M= 633.3 - 64.11(1.18) = 558 in-kips (63.1
kN-m);/= 558/[(V6)(O^ 16)(24)2] + 13.35/[0.416(24)] = 15.31 kips/in2 (105.5 MPa). This
is acceptable. Also, v = 1.5(64.11)/[0.416(24)] = 9.63 kips/in2 (66.4 MPa) This is also ac-
ceptable.

DESIGN OFA WELDED FLEXIBLE
BEAM CONNECTION

A Wl 8 x 64 beam is to be connected to the flange of its supporting column by means of a
welded framed connection, using E60 electrodes. Design a connection to transmit a reac-
tion of 40 kips (177.9 kN). The AISC table of welded connections may be applied in se-
lecting the connection, but the design must be verified by computing the stresses.

Calculation Procedure:

1. Record the pertinent properties of the beam

It is necessary to investigate both the stresses in the weld and the shearing stress in the
beam induced by the connection. The framing angles must fit between the fillets of the
beam. Record the properties: T= 153/8 in (390.5 mm); tw = 0.403 in (10.2 mm).

2. Select the most economical connection from the AISC Manual

The most economical connection is: angles 3 x 3 x 5/16 in (76 x 76 x 7.9 mm), 12 in (305
mm) long; weld size > Vie in (4.8 mm) for connection to beam web, 1A, in (6.4 mm) for
connection to the supporting member.
According to the AISC table, weld A has a capacity of 40.3 kips (179.3 kN), and weld
B has a capacity of 42.8 kips (190.4 kN). The minimum web thickness required is 0.25 in
(6.4 mm). The connection is shown in Fig. Ia.

3. Compute the unit force in the shop weld

The shop weld connects the angles to the beam web. Refer to Sec. 1 for two calculation
procedures for analyzing welded connections.
The weld for one angle is shown in Fig. Ib. The allowable force, as given in Sec. 1, is
m = 2(2.5)(1.25)/[2(2.5) + 12] = 0.37 in (9.4 mm); P = 20,000 Ib (88.9 KN); M= 20,000(3
- 0.37) = 52,600 in-lb (5942.7 N-m); Ix = (!/i2)(12)3 + 2(2.5)(6)2 = 324 in3 (5309.4 cm3); Iy
= 12(0.37)2 + 2(Vi2)(2.5)3 + 2(2.5)(0.88)2 = 8 in3 (131.1 cm3); J= 324 + 8 = 332 in3
(5440.5 cm3); fx = MyIJ = 52,600(6)7332 = 951 Ib/lin in (166.5 N/mm); fy = MxIJ =
52,600(2.5)(0.37)/332 = 337 Ib/lin in (59.0 N/mm); fy = 20,0007(2 x 2.5 + 12) = 1176
Ib/lin in (205.9 N/mm); Fx = 951 Ib/lin in (166.5 N/mm); Fy = 337 + 1176 = 1513 Ib/lin in
(265.0 N/mm); F= (9512 + 15132)05 = 1787 < 1800, which is acceptable.

4. Compute the shearing stress in the web

The allowable stress given in the AISC Manual is 14,500 lb/in2 (99.9 MPa). The two an-
gles transmit a unit shearing force of 3574 Ib/lin in (0.64 kN/mm) to the web. The shear-
ing stress is v = 3574/0.403 = 8870 lb/in2 (61.1 MPa), which is acceptable.

5. Compute the unit force in the field weld

The field weld connects the angles to the supporting member. As a result of the 3-in
(76.2-mm) eccentricity on the outstanding legs, the angles tend to rotate about a neutral
axis located near the top, bearing against the beam web above this axis and pulling away
from the web below this axis. Assume that the distance from the top of the angle to the
neutral axis is one-sixth of the length of the angle. The resultant forces are shown in Fig.
Ic. Then a = (V6) 12 = 10 in (254 mm); b = (2/3)12 = 8 in (203 mm); B = 20,000(3)/8 =
7500 Ib (33.4 KN);£ = 2RIa = 1500 Ib/lin in (262.7 N/mm);/; = 20,000/12 = 1667 Ib/lin
in (291.9 N/mm); F (15002 + 16672)0 5 = 2240 < 2400 Ib/lin in (420.3 N/mm), which is
acceptable. The weld is returned a distance of (H in (12.7 mm) across the top of the angle,
as shown in the AISC Manual.

DESIGN OFA WELDED SEATED
BEAM CONNECTION

A W27 x 94 beam with a reaction of 77 kips (342.5 KN) is to be supported on a seat. De-
sign a welded connection, using E60 electrodes.

FIGURE 7. Welded flexible beam connection.

Calculation Procedure:

1. Record the relevant properties of the beam

Refer to the AISC Manual. The connection will consist of a horizontal seat plate and a
stiffener plate below the seat, as shown in Fig. 80. Record the relevant properties of the
W27 x 94: k = 1.44 in (36.6 mm); b = 9.99 in (253.7 mm); tf= 0.747 in (19.0 mm); tw =
0.490 in (12.4 mm).

2. Compute the effective length of bearing

Equate the compressive stress at the toe of the fillet to its allowable value of 27 kips/in2
(186.1 MPa) as given in the AISC Manual. Assume that the reaction distributes itself
through the web at an angle of 45°. Refer to Fig. 86. Then N = P/21tw - k, or N =
77/27(0.490) - 1.44 = 4.38 in (111.3 mm).

3. Design the seat plate

As shown in the AISC Manual, the beam is set back about Vi in (12.7 mm) from the face
of the support. Make W — 5 in (127.0 mm). The minimum allowable distance from the
edge of the seat plate to the edge of the flange equals the weld size plus Vie in (7.8 mm).
Make the seat plate 12 in (304.8 mm) long; its thickness will be made the same as that of
the stiffener.

4. Design the weld connecting the stiffener plate to the support

The stresses in this weld are not amenable to precise analysis. The stiffener rotates about
a neutral axis, bearing against the support below this axis and pulling away from the sup-
port above this axis. Assume for simplicity that the neutral axis coincides with the cen-
troidal axis of the weld group; the maximum weld stress occurs at the top. A weld length
of 0.2L is supplied under the seat plate on each side of the stiffener. Refer to Fig. 8c.
Compute the distance e from the face of the support to the center of the bearing, meas-
uring TV from the edge of the seat. Thus, e=W-N/2 = 5- 4.38/2 - 2.81 in (71.4 mm); P
= 77 kips (342.5 kN); M= 77(2.81) = 216.4 in-kips (24.5 kN-m); m = OAIlL; Ix = 0.25L3
/! = McIIx = 216.4(0.417L)/0.25L3 = 361.0/Z,2 kips/lin in;/2 = PIA = 11/2AL = 32.08/L

FIGURE 8. Welded seated beam connection.

kips/lin in. Use a 5/i6-in (7.9-mm) weld, which has a capacity of 3 kips/lin in (525.4
N/mm). Then F2 =f2 +/2
2 = 130,300/L4 + 1029/Z2 < 32. This equation is satisfied by L =
14 in (355.6 mm).

5. Determine the thickness of the stiffener plate

Assume this plate is triangular (Fig. %d). The critical section for bending is assumed to co-
incide with the throat of the plate, and the maximum bending stress may be obtained by
applying/= (P/tWsin2 O)(I + 6e'IW), where e' = distance from center of seat to center of
bearing.
Using an allowable stress of 22,000 lb/in2 (151.7 MPa), we have e' = e-2.5 = 0.31 in
(7.9 mm), t= {77/[22 x 5(14/14,87)2]}(1 + 6 x 0.31/5) = 1.08 in (27.4 mm).
Use a I1Xs-In (28.6-mm) stiffener plate. The shearing stress in the plate caused by the
weld is v = 2(3000)71.125 = 5330 < 14,500 lb/in2 (99.9 MPa), which is acceptable.

DESIGN OFA WELDED
MOMENT CONNECTION

A Wl 6 x 40 beam frames to the flange of a W12 x 72 column and transmits a shear of 42
kips (186.8 kN) and a moment of 1520 in-kips (171.1 kN-m). Design a welded connec-
tion, using E60 electrodes.

Calculation Procedure:

1. Record the relevant properties of the two sections

In designing a welded moment connection, it is assumed for simplicity that the beam
flanges alone resist the bending moment. Consequently, the beam transmits three forces
to the column: the tensile force in the top flange, the compressive force in the bottom
flange, and the vertical load. Although the connection is designed ostensibly on an elastic
design basis, it is necessary to consider its
behavior at ultimate load, since a plastic
hinge would form at this joint. The con-
nection is shown in Fig. 9.
Record the relevant properties of the
sections: for the W16 x 40, d = 16.00 in
(406.4 mm); b = 7.00 in (177.8 mm); tf =
0.503 in (12.8 mm); tw = 0.307 in (7.8
mm); Af = 7.00(0.503) - 3.52 in2 (22.7
cm2). For the W12 x 72, k= 1.25 in (31.8
mm); ^ = 0.671 in (17.04 mm); tw - 0.403
in (10.2 mm).

2. Investigate the need for
column stiffeners: design the
stiffeners if they are needed

The forces in the beam flanges introduce
two potential modes of failure: crippling
of the column web caused by the com-
pressive force, and fracture of the weld
transmitting the tensile force as a result of
the bending of the column flange. The

FIGURE 9. Welded moment connection. 

AISC Specification establishes the criteria for ascertaining whether column stiffeners are
required. The first criterion is obtained by equating the compressive stress in the column
web at the toe of the fillet to the yield-point stress/J,; the second criterion was obtained
empirically. At the ultimate load, the capacity of the unreinforced web = (0.503 + 5 x
1.25)0.430/; = 2.904& capacity of beam flange = 3.52& QA(A/5 = 0.4(3.52)05 = 0.750
> 0.671 in (17.04 mm).
Stiffeners are therefore required opposite both flanges of the beam. The required area
is Ast = 3.52 - 2.904 = 0.616 in2 (3.97 cm2). Make the stiffener plates 31X2 in (88.9 mm)
wide to match the beam flange. From the AISC, rmin = 3.5/8.5 = 0.41 in (10.4 mm). Use
two 3V4 x !/2 in (88.9 x 12.7 mm) stiffener plates opposite both beam flanges.

3. Design the connection plate for the top flange

Compute the flange force by applying the total depth of the beam. Thus, F= 1520/16.00 =
95 kips (422.6 kN); A = 95/22 = 4.32 in2 (27.87 cm2).
Since the beam flange is 7 in (177.8 mm) wide, use a plate 5 in (127 mm) wide and %
in (22.2 mm) thick, for which A = 4.38 in2 (28.26 cm2). This plate is butt-welded to the
column flange and fillet-welded to the beam flange. In accordance with the AISC Specifi-
cation, the minimum weld size is 5/ie in (7.94 mm) and the maximum size is 13/ie in (20.6
mm). Use a 5/s-in (15.9-mm) weld, which has a capacity of 6000 Ib/lin in (1051 N/mm).
Then, length of weld = 95/6 = 15.8 in (401.3 mm), say 16 in (406.4 mm). To ensure that
yielding of the joint at ultimate load will occur in the plate rather than in the weld, the top
plate is left unwelded for a distance approximately equal to its width, as shown in Fig. 9.

4. Design the seat

The connection plate for the bottom flange requires the same area and length of weld as
does the plate for the top flange The stiffener plate and its connecting weld are designed
in the same manner as in the previous calculation procedure.

RECTANGULAR KNEE OF RIGID BENT

Figure 1Oa is the elevation of the knee of a rigid bent. Design the knee to transmit an ulti-
mate moment of 8100 in-kips (914.5 kN-m).

FIGURE 10. Rectangular knee.

Calculation Procedure:

1. Record the relevant properties of the two sections

Refer to the AISC Specification and Manual. It is assumed that the moment in each mem-
ber is resisted entirely by the flanges and that the distance between the resultant flange
forces is 0.95 times the depth of the member.
Record the properties of the members: for the W18 x 105, d= 18.32 in (465.3 mm); bf
= 11.79 in (299.5 mm); tf= 0.911 in (23.1 mm); tw = 0.554 in (14.1 mm); k = 1.625 in
(41.3 mm). For the W27 x 84, d = 26.69 in (677.9 mm); Zy= 9.96 in (253 mm); tf= 0.636
in (16.2 mm); tw = 0.463 in (11.8 mm).

2. Compute F1

Thus, F1 MJ(0.95d) = 8100/[0.95(18.32)] = 465 kips (2068.3 kN).

3. Determine whether web stiffeners are needed to transmit F1

The shearing stress is assumed to vary linearly from zero at a to its maximum value at d.
The allowable average shearing stress is taken as^/(3)0-5, where^J, denotes the yield-point
stress. The capacity of the web = 0.554(26.69)(36/305) = 307 kips (1365.5 kN). There-
fore, use diagonal web stiffeners.

4. Design the web stiffeners

Referring to Fig. 1Oc, we see that ac = (18.32 + 26.72)0-5 = 32.4 in (823 mm). The force in
the stiffeners = (465 - 307)32.4/26.7 = 192 kips (854.0 kN). (The same result is obtained
by computing F2 and considering the capacity of the web across ab.) Then, Ast = 192/36 =
5.33 in2 (34.39 cm2). Use two plates 4 x % in (101.6 x 19.1 mm).

5. Design the welds, using E60 electrodes

The AISC Specification stipulates that the weld capacity at ultimate load is 1.67 times the
capacity at the working load. Consequently, the ultimate-load capacity is 1000 Ib/lin in
(175 N/mm) times the number of sixteenths in the weld size. The welds are generally de-
signed to develop the full moment capacity of each member. Refer to the AISC Specifica-
tion.
Weld at ab. This weld transmits the force in the flange of the 27-in (685.8-mm) mem-
ber to the web of the 18-in (457.2-mm) member. Then F = 9.96(0.636)(36) = 228 kips
(1014.1 kN), weld force = 228/[2(J - 2^)] = 228/[2(18.32 - 1.82)] = 6.91 kips/lin in
(1210.1 N/mm). Use a 7i6-in (11.1 -mm) weld.
Weld at be. Use a full-penetration butt weld.
Weld at ac. Use the minimum size of 1A in (6.4 mm). The required total length of weld
is L = 192/4 = 48 in (1219.2 mm).
Weld at dc. Let F3 denote that part of F2 that is transmitted to the web of the 18-in
(457.2-mm) member through bearing, and let F4 denote the remainder of F2. Force F3 dis-
tributes itself through the 18-in (457.2-mm) member at 45° angles, and the maximum
compressive stress occurs at the toe of the fillet. Find F3 by equating this stress to 36
kips/in2 (248.2 MPa); orF3 = 36(0.554)(0.636 + 2 x 1.625) = 78 kips (346.9 kN). To eval-
uate F4, apply the moment capacity of the 27-in (685.8-mm) member. Or F4 = 228 - 78 =
150 kips (667.2 kN).
The minimum weld size of 1A in (6.4 mm) is inadequate. Use a 5/i6-in (7.9-mm) weld.
The required total length is L = 150/5 = 30 in (762.0 mm).

CURVED KNEE OF RIGID BENT

In Fig. 11 the rafter and column are both W21 x 82, and the ultimate moment at the two
sections of tangency —p and q—is 6600 in-kips (745.7 kN-m). The section of contraflex-

ure in each member lies 84 in (2133.6 mm)
from the section of tangency. Design the
knee.

Calculation Procedure:

1. Record the relevant
properties of the members

Refer to the Commentary in the AISC Man-
ual. The notational system is the same as
that used in the Manual, plus a = distance
from section of contraflexure to section of
tangency; b = member flange width; x =
distance from section of tangency to given
section; M = ultimate moment at given sec-
tion; Mp = plastic-moment capacity of knee 
at the given section.
Assume 
that 
the moment gradient
dM/dx remains constant across the knee.
The web thickness of the knee is made equal to that of the main material. The flange
thickness of the knee, however, must exceed that of the main material, for this reason: As
jc increases, both M and Mp increase, but the former increases at a faster rate when x is
small. The critical section occurs where dM/dx = dMpldx.
An exact solution to this problem is possible, but the resulting equation is rather cum-
bersome. An approximate solution is given in the AISC Manual.
Record the relevant properties of the the W21 x 82: d = 20.86 in (529.8 mm); b = 8.96
in (227.6 mm); tf= 0.795 in (20.2 mm); tw = 0.499 in (12.7 mm).

FIGURE 11. Curved knee,

2. Design the cross section of the knee, assuming tentatively that
flexure is the sole criterion

Use a trial thickness of 1A in (12.7 mm) for the web plate and a 9-in (228.6-mm) width for
the flange plate. Then a = 84 in (2133.6 mm); n = ald= 84/20.86 = 4.03. From the AISC
Manual, m = 0.14 ± t' = t(

Calculation Procedure:

1. Compute the required area of the base plate; establish the plate
dimensions

Refer to the base-plate diagram in the AISC Manual. The column load is assumed to be
uniformly distributed within the indicated rectangle, and the footing reaction is assumed
to he uniformly distributed across the base plate. The required thickness of the plate is es-
tablished by computing the bending moment at the circumference of the indicated rectan-
gle. Let/= maximum bending stress in plate;/? = bearing stress; t = thickness of plate.
The ACI Code permits a bearing stress of 750 lb/in2 (5170.5 kPa) if the entire concrete
area is loaded and 1125 lb/in2 (7755.8 kPa) if one-third of this area is loaded. Applying
the 750-lb/in2 (5170.5-kPa) value, we get plate area = load, lb/750 = 240,000/750 = 320
in2 (2064.5 cm2).
The dimensions of the W14 x 53 are d = 13.94 in (354.3 mm); b = 8.06 in (204.7 mm);
0.95J = 13.24 in (335.3 mm); 0.806 = 6.45 in (163.8 mm). For economy, the projections
m and n should be approximately equal. Set B = 15 in (381 mm) and C = 22 in (558.8
mm); then, area - 15(22) - 330 in2 (2129 cm2); p = 240,000/330 = 727 lb/in2 (5011.9
kPa).

2. Compute the required thickness of the base plate

Thus, m = l/2(22 - 13.24) = 4.38 in (111.3 mm), which governs. Also, n = V2(IS - 6.45) =
4.28 in (108.7 mm).
The AISC Specification permits a bending stress of 27,000 lb/in2 (186.1 MPa) in a rec-
tangular plate. The maximum bending stress is/= MIS = 3pm2/12; t = m(3p/f)°-5 = 4.38(3
x 727/27,00O)05 = 1.24 in (31.5 mm).

3. Summarize the design

Thus, B = 15 in (381 mm); C = 22 in (558.8 mm); t = 1% in (31.8 mm).

BASE FOR STEEL COLUMN
WITH END MOMENT

A steel column of 14-in (355.6-mm) depth transmits to its footing an axial load of 30 kips
(133.4 kN) and a moment of 1100 in-kips (124.3 kN-m) in the plane of its web. Design the
base, using A307 anchor bolts and 3000-lb/in2 (20.7-MPa) concrete.

Calculation Procedure:

1. Record the allowable stresses and modular ratio

Refer to Fig. 12. If the moment is sufficiently large, it causes uplift at one end of the plate
and thereby induces tension in the anchor bolt at that end. A rigorous analysis of the
stresses in a column base transmitting a moment is not possible. For simplicity, compute
the stresses across a horizontal plane through the base plate by treating this as the cross
section of a reinforced-concrete beam, the anchor bolt on the tension side acting as the re-
inforcing steel. The effects of initial tension in the bolts are disregarded.
The anchor bolts are usually placed 21^ (63.5 mm) or 3 in (76.2 mm) from the column
flange. Using a plate of 26-in (660-mm) depth as shown in Fig. 12a, let A8 - anchor-bolt
cross-sectional area; B = base-plate width; C = resultant compressive force on base plate;
T = tensile force in anchor bolt; fs = stress in anchor bolt; p = maximum bearing stress;
p' = bearing stress at column face; / = base-plate thickness.

Recording the allowable stresses and modular ra-
tio by using the ACI Code, we get p = 750 lb/in2
(5170 kPa) and n = 9. From the AISC Specification,
fs = 14,000 lb/in2 (96.5 MPa); the allowable bending
stress in the plate is 27,000 lb/in2 (186.1 MPa).

2. Construct the stress
and force diagrams

These are shown in Fig. 13. Then^/« = 14/9 = 1.555
kips/in2 (10.7 MPa); kd = 23(0.750/2.305) = 7.48 in
(190.0 mm); Jd = 23 - 7.48/3 = 20.51 in (521.0 mm).

3. Design the base plate

Thus, C = Y2(IAS)(OJSOB) = 2.8055. Take mo-
ments with respect to the anchor bolt, or SAf =
30(10) + 1100 - 2.8055(20.51) = O; B = 24.3 in
(617.2mm).
Assume that the critical bending stress in the
base plate occurs at the face of the column. Compute
the bending moment at the face for a 1-in (25.4-mm)
width of plate. Referring to Fig. 13c, we have />' =
0.750(1.48/7.48) = 0.148 kips/in2 (1020.3 kPa); M =
(62/6)(0.148 + 2 x 0.750) = 9.89 in-kips (1.12
kN-m); t2-6M/21 = 2.20 in2 (14.19 cm2); t= 1.48 in
(37.6 mm). Make the base plate 25 in (635 mm)
wide and I1A in (38.1 mm) thick.

4. Design the anchor bolts

(c) Stresses

From the calculation in step 3 ,C = 2.8055 =
2.805(24.3) - 68.2 kips (303.4 kN); T= 68.2 - 30 =
38.2 kips (169.9 kN); A5 = 38.2/14 - 2.73 in2 (17.61
cm2). Refer to the AISC Manual. Use 2%-in (57.2- 
mm) anchor bolts, one on each side of the flange.
Then A3 = 3.02 in2 (19.48 cm2). 
5. Design the anchorage for the bolts 
The bolts are held by angles welded to the column 
flange, as shown in Fig. 12 and in the AISC Manual.
Use 1X2-In (12.7-mm) angles 12 in (304.8 mm) long.
Each line of weld resists a force of 1AT. Refer to Fig.
13 d and compute the unit force F at the extremity of
the weld. Thus, M= 19.1(3) = 57.3 in-kips (6.47 kN-m); Sx = (V6)(12)2 24 in2 (154.8 cm2);
Fx = 57.3/24 - 2.39 kips/lin in (0.43 kN/mm); F = 19.1/12 = 1.59 kips/lin in (0.29
kN/mm); F = (2.392 + 1.592)05 = 2.87 kips/lin in (0.52 kN/mm). Use a 5Xi6-in (4.8-mm)
fillet weld of E60 electrodes, which has a capacity of 3 kips/lin in (0.54 kN/mm).

FIGURE 13. (a) Stresses; (b) forces and moment; (c) stresses on
projection; (d) force on weld.

Calculation Procedure:

1. Establish the dimensions of the grillage

Refer to Fig. 14. A load of this magnitude cannot be transmitted from the column to its
footing through the medium of a base plate alone. It is therefore necessary to interpose
steel beams between the base plate and the footing; these may be arranged in one tier or in
two orthogonal tiers. Integrity of each tier is achieved by tying the beams together by pipe
separators. This type of column support is termed a grillage. In designing the grillage, it
is assumed that bearing pressures are uniform across each surface under consideration.
The area of grillage required = load, kips/allowable stress, kips/in2 = 2790/0.750 =
3720 in2 (23,994 cm2). Set A = 60 in (1524 mm) and B = 62 in (1574.8 mm), giving an
area of 3720 in2 (23,994 cm2), as required.

2. Design the upper-tier beams

There are three criteria: bending stress, shearing stress, and compressive stress in the web
at the toe of the fillet. The concrete between the beams supplies lateral restraint, and the
allowable bending stress is therefore 24 kips/in2 (165.5 MPa).
Since the web stresses are important criteria, a grillage is generally constructed of S
shapes rather than wide-flange beams to take advantage of the thick webs of S shapes.
The design of the beams requires the concurrent determination of the length a of the base
plate. Le t /= bending stress;/,, = compressive stress in web at fillet toe; v = shearing
stress, P = load carried by single beam; S = section modulus of single beam; k = distance
from outer surface of beam to toe of fillet; tw = web thickness of beam; ^1 = length of
plate as governed by flexure; a2 = length of plate as governed by compressive stress in
web.

Select a beam size on the basis of stresses/and/,, and then investigate v. The maxi-

mum bending moment occurs at the center of the span; its value is M = P(A - a)/8 =fS;
therefore, O1=A- SfSIP.
At the toe of the fillet, the load P is distributed across a distance a + 2k. Then/^ = Pl(a
+ 2k)tw; therefore, a2 = P/fyw - 2k. Try four beams; then P = 2790/4 = 697.5 kips (3102.5
kN ) ; /= 24 kips/in2 (165.5 MPa); fb = 27 kips/in2 (186.1 MPa). Upon substitution, the
foregoing equations reduce to a} = 60 - 0.2755; a2 = 25.8/*w - 2k.
Select the trial beam sizes shown in the accompanying table, and calculate the corre-
sponding values of Or1 and a2.

Try S18 x 70, with a = 34 in (863.6 mm). The flange width is 6.25 in (158.8 mm). The
maximum vertical shear occurs at the edge of the plate; its magnitude is V = P(A - d)(2A)
= 697.5(60 - 34)/[2(60)] = 151.1 kips (672.1 kN); v = 151.1/[18(0.71I)] = 11.8 < 14.5
kips/in2 (99.9 MPa), which is acceptable.

3. Design the base plate

Refer to the second previous calculation procedure. To permit the deposition of concrete,
allow a minimum space of 2 in (50.8 mm) between the beam flanges. The minimum value
of b is therefore b = 4(6.25) + 3(2) = 31 in (787.4 mm).
The dimensions of the effective bearing area under the column are 0.95(16.81 + 2 x
15) = 18.82 in (478.0 mm); 0.80(20) = 16 in (406.4 mm). The projection of the plate are
(34 - 18.82)/2 = 7.59 in (192.8 mm); (31 - 16)/2 = 7.5 in (190.5 mm).
Therefore, keep 6 = 31 in (787 mm), because this results in a well-proportioned plate.

The pressure under the plate - 2790/[34(3I)] = 2.65 kips/in2 (18.3 MPa). For a 1-in (25.4-
mm) width of plate, M= V2(2.65)/(l .59)2 - 76.33 irrkips (8.6 kN-m); S = MIf= 76.33/27
= 2.827 in3 (46.33 cm3; t = (65)°5 = 4.12 in (104.6 mm).
Plate thicknesses within this range vary by %-in (3.2-mm) increments, as stated in the
AISC Manual. However, a section of the AISC Specification requires that plates over 4 in
(102 mm) thick be planed at all bearing surfaces. Set t = 4l/2 in (114.3 mm) to allow for
the planing.

4. Design the beams at the lower tier

Try seven beams. Thus, P = 2790/7 = 398.6 kips (1772.9 kN); M = 398.6(62 - 31)/8 =
1545 in-kips (174.6 kN-m); S3 = 1545/24 = 64.4 in3 (1055.3 cm3).
Try S15 x 50. Then S = 64.2 in3 (1052.1 cm3); tw = 0.550 in (14.0 mm); k = 1.25 in
(31.8 mm); b = 5.64 in (143.3 mm). The space between flanges is [60 - 7 x 5.641/6 = 3.42
in (86.9 mm). This result is satisfactory. Then/6 = 398.6/[0.550(31 + 2 x 1.25)] = 21.6 <
27 kips/in2 (186.1 MPa), which is satisfactory; V= 398.6(62 - 31)/[2(62)] = 99.7 kips
(443.5 kN); v = 99.7/[15(0.55O)] - 12.1 < 14.5, which is satisfactory.

5. Summarize the design

Thus: A = 60 in (1524 mm); B = 62 in (1574.8 mm); base plate is 31 x 34 x 41/2 in (787.4
x 863.6 x 114.3 mm), upper-tier steel, four beams Sl8 x 70; lower-tier steel, seven beams
15150.0.

WIND-STRESS ANALYSIS
BY PORTAL METHOD

The bent in Fig. 15 resists the indicated wind loads. Applying the portal method of analy-
sis, calculate all shears, end moments, and axial forces.

Calculation Procedure:

1. Compute the shear factor for each column

The portal method is an approximate and relatively simple method of wind-stress analysis
that is frequently applied to regular bents of moderate height. It considers the bent to be
composed of a group of individual portals and makes the following assumptions. (1) The
wind load is distributed among the aisles of the bent in direct proportion to their relative
widths. (2) The point of contraflexure in each member lies at its center.
Because of the first assumption, the shear in a given column is directly proportional to
the average width of the adjacent aisles. (An alternative form of the portal method as-
sumes that the wind load is distributed uniformly among the aisles, irrespective of their
relative widths.)
In this analysis, we consider the end moments of a member, i.e., the moments exerted
at the ends of the member by the joints. The sign conventions used are as follows. An end
moment is positive if it is clockwise. The shear is positive if the lateral forces exerted on
the member by the joints constitute a couple having a counterclockwise moment. An axi-
al force is positive if it is tensile.
Figure 160 and b represents a beam and column, respectively, having positive end mo-
ments and positive shear. By applying the second assumption, Ma = Mb = M, Eq. a; V =
2MIL, OTM= VLII, Eq. b;H = 2MIL, or M = HL/2, Eq. c. In Fig. 15, the calculated data
for each member are recorded in the order indicated.

Note Data recorded in following o rde r: shear, end moments, ax ial fo rce.

FIGURE 15. Wind-stress analysis by portal method.

The shear factor equals the ratio of
the average width of the adjacent aisles
to the total width. Or, line A9 15/75 =
0.20; line B, (15 + 12)775 = 0.36; line C,
(12 + 10.5X75 = 0.30; line D9 10.5/75 =
0.14. For convenience, record these val-
ues in Fig. 15.

2. Compute the shear
in each column

For 
instance, column A-2-3, H =
-3900(0.20) = -780 Ib (-3.5 kN); col-
umn Ci1-2, H = -(39OO + 7500)0.30 =
-3420 Ib (-15.2 kN).

FIGURE 16 

(b) 

Apply Eq. c. For instance, column A-2-3, M= /2(-78O)IS =-5850 ft-lb (-7932.6 N-m); column
Z)-O-I, M= /2(-275I)IS = -24,759 ft-lb (-33,573.2 N-m).

3. Compute the end moments
of each column

4. Compute the end moments of each beam

Do this by equating the algebraic sum of end moments at each joint to zero. For instance,
at line 3: MAB = 5850 ft-lb (7932.6 N-m); MBC = -5850 + 10,530 = 4680 ft-lb (6346.1
N-m); MCD = -4680 + 8775 = 4095 ft-lb (5552.8 N-m). At line 2: MAB = 5850 + 17,100 =
22,950 ft-lb (31,120.2 N-m); MBC = -22,950 + 30,780 + 10,530 = 18,360 ft-lb (24,896.0
N-m).

5. Compute the shear in each beam

Do this by applying Eq. b. For instance, beam B-2-C, V= 2(18,360)724 = 1530 Ib (6.8
kN).

6. Compute the axial force in each member

Do this by drawing free-body diagrams of the joints and applying the equations of equi-
librium. It is found that the axial forces in the interior columns are zero. This condition
stems from the first assumption underlying the portal method and the fact that each interi-
or column functions as both the leeward column of one portal and the windward column
of the adjacent portal.
The absence of axial forces in the interior columns in turn results in the equality of the
shear in the beams at each tier. Thus, the calculations associated with the portal method of
analysis are completely self-checking.

WIND-STRESS ANALYSIS
BY CANTILEVER METHOD

For the bent in Fig. 17, calculate all shears, end moments, and axial forces induced by the
wind loads by applying the cantilever method of wind-stress analysis. For this purpose,
assume that the columns have equal cross-sectional areas.

Calculation Procedure:

1. Compute the shear and moment on the bent at midheight
of each horizontal row of columns

The cantilever method, which is somewhat more rational than the portal method,

Note Data recorded in fo l low ing o rde r: shear, end moments, a x i al fo rce.

FIGURE 17. Wind-stress analysis by cantilever method.

considers that the bent behaves as a vertical cantilever. Consequently, the direct stress in a
column is directly proportional to the distance from the column to the centroid of the
combined column area. As in the portal method, the assumption is made that the point of
contraflexure in each member lies at its center. Refer to the previous calculation proce-
dure for the sign convention.
Computing the shear and moment on the bent at midheight, we have the following.
Upper row: H= 3900 Ib (17.3 kN); M= 3900(7.5) = 29,250 ft-lb (39,663.0 N-m). Center
row: H= 3900 + 7500 = 11,400 Ib (50.7 kN); M= 3900(22.5) + 7500(7.5) 144,000 ft-lb
(195.3 kN-m). Lower row: H= 11,400 + 8250 = 19,650 Ib (87.5 kN); M= 3900(39) +
7500(24) + 8250(9) = 406,400 ft-lb (551.1 kN-m), or M = 144,000 + 11,400(16.5) +
8250(9) = 406,400 ft-lb (551.1 kN-m), as before.

2. Locate the centroidal axis of the combined column area,
and compute the moment of inertia of the area with respect
to this axis

Take the area of one column as a unit. Then x = (30 + 54 + 75)/4 = 39.75 ft (12.12 m); / =
39.752 + 9.752 + 14.252 + 35.252 = 3121 ft2 (289.95 m2).

3. Compute the axial force in each column

Use the equation/= MyIL The yll values are

Then column A-2-3, P = 29,250(0.01274) = 373 kips (1659 kN); column 5-0-1, P =
406,400(0.00312) = 1268 kips (5640 kN).

4. Compute the shear in each beam by analyzing each joint
as a free body

Thus, beam A-3-B, V= 373 Ib (1659 N); beam 5-3-C, V= 373 + 91 = 464 Ib (2.1 kN);
beam C-3-D, V= 464 - 134 = 330 Ib (1468 N); beam A-2-B, V= 1835 - 373 = 1462 Ib
(6.5 kN); beam B-I-C, V= 1462 + 449 - 91 = 1820 Ib (8.1 kN).

5. Compute the end moments of each beam

Apply Eq. b of the previous calculation procedure. Or for beam A-3-B, M= !4(373)(30) =
5595 ft-lb (7586.8 N-m).

6. Compute the end moments of each column

Do this by equating the algebraic sum of the end moments at each joint to zero.

7. Compute the shear in each column

Apply Eq. c of the previous calculation procedure. The sum of the shears in each horizon-
tal row of columns should equal the wind load above that plane. For instance, for the cen-
ter row, ^H = -(2178 + 4348 + 3522 + 1352) - -11,400 Ib (-50.7 kN), which is correct.

8. Compute the axial force in each beam by analyzing each joint
as a free body

Thus, beam A-3-B, P = -3900 + 746 - -3154 Ib (-14.0 kN); beam 5-3-C, P = -3154
+ 1488 = -1666 Ib (-7.4 kN).

WIND-STRESS ANALYSIS BY
SLOPE-DEFLECTION METHOD

Analyze the bent in Fig. 180 by the slope-deflection method. The moment of inertia of
each member is shown in the drawing.

Calculation Procedure:

1. Compute the end rotations caused by the applied moments
and forces; superpose the rotation caused by the transverse
displacement

This method of analysis has not been applied extensively in the past because the arith-
metic calculations involved become voluminous where the bent contains many joints.
However, the increasing use of computers in structural design is overcoming this obstacle
and stimulating a renewed interest in the method.
Figure 19 is the elastic curve of a member subjected to moments and transverse forces

applied solely at its ends. The sign convention is as follows: an end moment is positive if
it is clockwise; an angular displacement is positive if the rotation is clockwise; the trans-
verse displacement A is positive if it rotates the member in a clockwise direction.
Computing the end rotations gives Oa = (L/6EI)(2Ma, - Mb) + A/L; Sb = (LI6EI)(-Ma +
2Mb) + A/L. These results may be obtained by applying the moment-area method or unit-
load method given in Sec. 1.

2. Solve the foregoing equations for the end moments

Thus,

10. Compute the shear in each member by analyzing the member
as a free body

The shear is positive if the transverse forces exert a counterclockwise moment. Thus Hab
= (Mab + Mba)/2Q = -2.43 kips (-10.8 kN); Hcd = -3.08 kips (-13.7 kN); Hce = 4.49 kips
(19.9 kN); Vbc = 0.88 kip (3.9 kN).

11. Compute the axial force in AB and BC

Thus Pab = 0.88 kip (3.91 kN); Pbc = -7.57 kips (-33.7 kN). The axial forces in EC and
CD are found by equating the elongation of one to the contraction of the other.

12. Check the bent for equilibrium

The forces and moments acting on the structure are shown in Fig. 186. The three equa-
tions of equilibrium are satisfied.

WIND DRIFT OF A BUILDING

Figure 2Qa is the partial elevation of the steel framing of a skyscraper. The wind shear di-
rectly above line 11 is 40 kips (177.9 kN), and the wind force applied at lines 11 and 12 is
4 kips (17.8 kN) each. The members represented by solid lines have the moments of iner-
tia shown in Table 1, and the structure is to be analyzed for wind stress by the portal
method. Compute the wind drift for the bent bounded by lines 11 and 12; that is, find the
horizontal displacement of the joints on line 11 relative to those on line 12 as a result of
wind.

Calculation Procedure:

1. Using the portal method of wind-stress analysis, compute
the shear in each column caused by the unit loads

Apply the unit-load method presented in Sec. 1. For this purpose, consider that unit hori-
zontal loads are applied to the structure in the manner shown in Fig. 2OZ?.
The results obtained in steps 1, 2, and 3 below are recorded in Fig. 2OZ?. To apply the
portal method of wind-stress analysis, see the fourteenth calculation procedure in this sec-
tion.

2. Compute the end moments of each column caused
by the unit loads
3. Equate the algebraic sum of end moments at each joint
to zero; from this find the end moments of the beams caused
by the unit loads
4. Find the end moments of each column

Multiply the results obtained in step 2 by the wind shear in each panel to find the end mo-
ments of each column in Fig. 20«. For instance, the end moments of column C-11-12 are
-1.95(44) = -85.8 ft-kips (-116.3 kN-m). Record the result in Fig. 2Oa.

5. Find the end moments of the beams caused by the true loads

Equate the algebraic sum of end moments at each joint to zero to find the end moments of
the beams caused by the true loads.

6. State the equation for wind drift

In Fig. 21, Me and me denote the end moments caused by the true load and unit load, re-
spectively. Then the

Wind drift A = —

SM6W^Z
— 

jJCtl.

7. Compute the wind drift by completing Table 1

In recording end moments, algebraic signs may be disregarded because the product
Meme is always positive. Taking the total of the last column in Table 1, we find

FIGURE 21. Bending-moment diagrams.

A = 19.25(12)2/[3(29)(10)3] = 0.382 in (9.7 mm). For dimensional homogeneity, the left
side of Eq. 5 must be multiplied by 1 kip (4.45 kN). The product represents the external
work performed by the unit loads.

REDUCTION IN WIND DRIFT BY USING
DIAGONAL BRACING

With reference to the previous calculation procedure, assume that the wind drift of the
bent is to be restricted to 0.20 in (5.1 mm) by introducing diagonal bracing between lines
B and C. Design the bracing, using the gross area of the member.

Calculation Procedure:

1. State the change in length of the brace

The bent will be reinforced against lateral deflection by a pair of diagonal cross braces,
each brace being assumed to act solely as a tension member. Select the lightest single-
angle member that will satisfy the stiffness requirements; then compute the wind drift of
the reinforced bent.
Assume that the bent in Fig. 22 is deformed in such a manner that B is displaced a hor-
izontal distance A relative to D. Let A — cross-sectional area of member CB; P = axial
force in CB; Ph= horizontal component of P; 8L = change in length of CB. From the
geometry of Fig. 22, 8L = A cos 9 = aklL ap-
proximately.

2. Express Ph in terms of A

Thus, P = aAEML2; Ph = P cos 0 = PaIL;
then

P>-^ 

(6)

3. Select a trial size for the
diagonal bracing; compute the
tensile capacity

A section of the AISC Specification limits the
slenderness ratio for bracing members in ten- 

FIGURE 22

sion to 300, and another section provides an allowable stress of 22 kips/in2 (151.7 MPa).
Thus, L2 = 142 + 122 = 340 ft2 (31.6 in2); L = 18.4 ft (5.61 m); rmin = (18.4 x 12)7300 =
0.74 in (18.8 mm).
Try a 4 x 4 x 1/4 in (101.6 x 101.6 x 6.35 mm) angle; r = 0.79 in (20.1 mm); A = 1.94
in2 (12.52 cm2); Pmax = 1.94(22) = 42.7 kips (189.9 kN).

4. Compute the wind drift if the assumed size of bracing is used

By Eq. 6, Ph = {196/[(340))18.4)(12)]) 1.94(29)(10)3A = 147A kips (653.9A N). The wind
shear resisted by the columns of the bent is reduced by Ph, and the wind drift is reduced
proportionately.
From the previous calculation procedure, the following values are obtained: without
diagonal bracing, A = 0.382 in (9.7 mm); with diagonal bracing, A = 0.3827(44 - Ph)/44 =
0.382 - 1.28A. Solving gives A = 0.168 < 0.20 in (5.1 mm), which is acceptable.

5. Check the axial force in the brace

Thus, Ph = 147(0.168) = 24.7 kips (109.9 kN); P = P^Ia = 24.7(18.4)714 = 32.5 < 42.7
kips (189.9 kN), which is satisfactory. Therefore, the assumed size of the member is satis-
factory.

LIGHT-GAGE STEEL BEAM WITH
UNSTIFFENED FLANGE

A beam of light-gage cold-formed steel consists of two 7 x Iy2 in (177.8 x 38.1 mm) by
no. 12 gage channels connected back to back to form an I section. The beam is simply
supported on a 16-ft (4.88-m) span, has continuous lateral support, and carries a total dead
load of 50 Ib/lin ft (730 N/m). The live-load deflection is restricted to 1/360 of the span. If
the yield-point stress^, is 33,000 lb/in2 (227.5 MPa), compute the allowable unit live load
for this member.

Calculation Procedure:

1. Record the relevant properties of the section

Apply the AISI Specification for the Design of Light Gage Cold-Formed Steel Structural
Members. This is given in the AISI publication Light Gage Cold-Formed Steel Design
Manual. Use the same notational system, except denote the flat width of an element by g
rather than w.
The publication mentioned above provides a basic design stress of 20,000 lb/in2
(137.9 MPa) for this grade of steel. However, since the compression flange of the given
member is unstiffened in accordance with the definition in one section of the publication,
it may be necessary to reduce the allowable compressive stress. A table in the Manual
gives the dimensions, design properties, and allowable stress of each section, but the al-
lowable stress will be computed independently in this calculation procedure.
Let V — maximum vertical shear; M= maximum bending moment; w = unit load; fb =
basic design stress;/, = allowable bending stress in compression; v = shearing stress; A =
maximum deflection.
Record the relevant properties of the section as shown in Fig. 23: Ix = 12.4 in4 (516.1
cm4); Sx = 3.54 in3 (58.0 cm3); R = 3A6 in (4.8 mm).

2. Compute fc

Thus, g = B/2 - t - R = 1.1935 in (30.3 mm); git = 1.1935/0.105 = 11.4. From the

Manual, 
the allowable stress corresponding
to this ratio is fc = \.661fb - 8640 - 
\(fb -
12,950)g/f]/15 = 1.667(20,000) - 8640 - (20,000
- 12,950)11.4/15 = 19,340 lb/in2 (133.3 MPa).

3. Compute the allowable unit live
load If flexure is the sole criterion

Thus M =fcSx= 19,340(3.54)712 = 5700 ft-lb
(7729.2 N-m); w = 8M/Z2 = 8(5700)7162 = 178
Ib/lin ft (2.6 kN/m); WLL = 178 - 50 = 128 Ib/lin

ft(1.87kN/m).

4. Investigate the deflection under
the computed live load

Using E = 29,500,000 lb/in2 (203,373 MPa) as
given in the AISI Manual, we have ALL .=
5wLLL4/(384EIx) = 5(128)(16)4(12)3/[384(29.5)
(10)612.4] = 0.516 in (13.1 mm); ALLa l low = 
16(12)7360 = 0.533 in (13.5 mm), which is satis-
factory.

5. Investigate the shearing stress
under the computed total load

FIGURE 23

Refer to the AISI Specification. For the individual channel, h = D - 2t = 6.79 in (172.5
mm); hit = 64.7; 64,000,000/64.72 > 2Afb; therefore, vMow = 13,330 lb/in2 (91.9 MPa); the
web area = 0.105(6.79) = 0.713 in2 (4.6 cm2); V= 1X4(178)16 = 712 Ib (3.2 kN); v =
712/0.713 < #aiiow» which is satisfactory. The allowable unit live load is therefore 128
Ib/lin ft (1.87 kN/m).

LIGHT-GAGE STEEL BEAM WITH STIFFENED
COMPRESSION FLANGE

A beam of light-gage cold-formed steel has a hat cross section 8 * 12 in (203.2 * 304.8
mm) of no. 12 gage, as shown in Fig. 24. The beam is simply supported on a span of 13 ft

FIGURE 24

(3.96 m). If the yield-point stress is 33,000 lb/in2 (227.5 MPa), compute the allowable
unit load for this member and the corresponding deflection.

Calculation Procedure:

1. Record the relevant properties of the entire cross-sectional area

Refer to the AISI Specification and Manual. The allowable load is considered to be the
ultimate load that the member will carry divided by a load factor of 1.65. At ultimate
load, the bending stress varies considerably across the compression flange. To surmount
the difficulty that this condition introduces, the AISI Specification permits the designer to
assume that the stress is uniform across an effective flange width to be established in the
prescribed manner. The investigation is complicated by the fact that the effective flange
width and the bending stress in compression are interdependent quantities, for the follow-
ing reason. The effective width depends on the compressive stress; the compressive
stress, which is less than the basic design stress, depends on the location of the neutral
axis; the location of the neutral axis, in turn, depends on the effective width.
The beam deflection is also calculated by establishing an effective flange width. How-
ever, since the beam capacity is governed by stresses at the ultimate load and the beam
deflection is governed by stresses at working load, the effective widths associated with
these two quantities are unequal.
A table in the AISI Manual contains two design values that afford a direct solution to
this problem. However, the values are computed independently here to demonstrate how
they are obtained. The notational system presented in the previous calculation procedure
is used, as well as A' = area of cross section exclusive of compression flange; H= static
moment of cross-sectional area with respect to top of section; yb and yt = distance from
centroidal axis of cross section to bottom and top of section, respectively.
We use the AISI Manual to determine the relevant properties of the entire cross-sec-
tional area, as shown in Fig. 24: A = 3.13 in2 (20.2 cm2); yb = 5.23 in (132.8 mm); /, =
26.8 in4 (1115.5 cm4); R = Vi6 in (4.8 mm).

2. Establish the value of fc for load determination

Use the relation (8040;2//C°-5){1 - 2010/[(/c°-5g)/f]} = (HID)(fc +fb)lfc-A'. Substituting
givesg = B-2(t + R)= 12.0-2(0.105 + 0.1875) = 11.415 in(289.9 mm);git = 108.7;gt
= 1.20 in2 (7.74 cm2); A = 3.13 - 1.20 = 1.93 in2 (12.45 cm2); yt = 8.0 - 5.23 = 2.77 in
(70.36 cm); H= 3.13(2.77) = 8.670 in3 (142.1 cm3). The foregoing equation then reduces
to (88.64//°-5)(l - 18.49//?5) = 1.084(/c + 20,000)//c - 1.93. By successive approxima-
tions,^ = 14,800 lb/in2 (102.0 MPa).

3. Compute the corresponding effective flange width for load
determination in accordance with the AISI Manual

Thus, b = (8040f#?-5)l - 2010/[(/?-5g)/f]} = (8040 x 0.105/14,800°-5)[1 - 2010/(14,800°-5
x 108.7)] - 5.885 in (149.5 mm).

4. Locate the centroidal axis of the cross section having this
effective width; check the value of fc

Refer to Fig. 246. Thus h=g-b=ll.4l5- 5.885 = 5.530 in (140.5 mm); ht = 0.581 in2
(3.75 cm2); A = 3.13 - 0.581 = 2.549 in2 (16.45 cm2); H = 8.670 in3 (142.1 cm3); yt =
8.670/ 2.549 = 3.40 in (86.4 mm); yb = 4.60 in (116.8 mm);/c =ytlyb = 3.40(20,000)/4.60
= 14,800 lb/in2 (102.0 MPa), which is satisfactory.

5. Compute the allowable load

The moment of inertia of the net section may be found by applying the value of the gross
section and making the necessary corrections. Applying Sx = IxIy^ we get Ix = 26.8 +

3.13(3.40 - 2.77)2 - 0.581(3.40 - 0.053)2 - 21.53 in4 (896.15 cm4). Then Sx = 21.53/4.60
= 4.68 in3 (76.69 cm3). This value agrees with that recorded in the AISI Manual.
Then M=f£x = 20,000(4.68)712 = 7800 ft-lb (10,576 N-m); w = 8M/L2 = 8(7800)/132
= 369 Ib/lin ft (5.39 kN/m).

6. Establish the value of fy for deflection determination

Apply (10,320*2//c°-5)[l - 2580/0? V)] = (HID)(fc +fb)lfc -A', or (113.8//c°-5) x (1 -
23.74//?5) = 1.084(/c + 20,000)//c - 1.93. By successive approximation,^ = 13,300 lb/in2
(91.7MPa).

7. Compute the corresponding effective flange width for
deflection determination

Thus, b = (10,320*//? 5)[1 - 2580/(/c° 5g/0] = (10,320 x 0.105/13,300° 5)[1 - 2580/
(13,30005 x 108.7)] = 7.462 in (189.5 mm).

8. Locate the centroidal axis of the cross section having this
effective width; check the value of fc

Thus h = 11.415 - 7.462 - 3.953 in (100.4 mm); ht = 0.415 in2 (2.68 cm2); A = 313 -
0.415 = 2.715 in2 (17.52 cm2); H= 8.670 in3 (142.1 cm3);^ = 8.670/2.715 = 3.19 in (81.0
mm); yb = 4.81 in (122.2 mm);/c = (3.19/4.81)20,000 - 13,300 lb/in2 (91.7 MPa), which
is satisfactory.

9. Compute the deflection

For the net section, /, = 26.8 + 3.13(3.19 - 2.77)2 - 0.415(3.19 - 0.053)2 = 23.3 in4 (969.8
cm4). This value agrees with that tabulated in the AISI Manual. The deflection is A =
5wL4/(3&4EIx) = 5(369)(13)4(12)3/[384(29.5)(10)623.3] = 0.345 in (8.8 mm).

REINFORCED CONCRETE

The design of reinforced-concrete members in this handbook is executed in accordance
with the specification titled Building Code Requirements for Reinforced Concrete of the
American Concrete Institute (ACI). The ACI Reinforced Concrete Design Handbook
contains many useful tables that expedite design work. The designer should become thor-
oughly familiar with this handbook and use the tables it contains whenever possible.
The spacing of steel reinforcing bars in a concrete member is subject to the restrictions
imposed by the ACI Code. With reference to the beam and slab shown in Fig. 1, the rein-
forcing steel is assumed, for simplicity, to be concentrated at its centroidal axis, and the
effective depth of the flexural member is taken as the distance from the extreme compres-
sion fiber to this axis. (The term depth hereafter refers to the effective rather than the over-
all depth of the beam.) For design purposes, it is usually assumed that the distance from
the exterior surface to the center of the first row of steel bars is 21A in (63.5 mm) in a beam
with web stirrups, 2 in (50.8 mm) in a beam without stirrups, and 1 in (25.4 mm) in a slab.
Where two rows of steel bars are provided, it is usually assumed that the distance from
the exterior surface to the centroidal axis of the reinforcement is 31A in (88.9 mm). The
ACI Handbook gives the minimum beam widths needed to accommodate various combi-
nations of bars in one row.
In a well-proportioned beam, the width-depth ratio lies between 0.5 and 0.75. The
width and overall depth are usually an even number of inches.
The basic notational system pertaining to reinforced concrete beams is as follows:
fc = ultimate compressive strength of concrete, lb/in2 (kPa); fc = maximum compressive
stress in concrete, lb/in2 (kPa);^ = tensile
stress in steel, lb/in2 (kPa);^, = yield-point
stress in steel, lb/in2 (kPa); ec = strain of
extreme compression fiber; es = strain of
steel; b = beam width, in (mm); d = beam
depth, in (mm); A3 = area of tension rein-
forcement, 
in2 
(cm2); p = 
tension-
reinforcement ratio, As

design of a steel structure, the capacity of the structure is found by determining the load
that will cause failure and dividing this result by the prescribed load factor. The load at
impending failure is termed the ultimate load, and the maximum bending moment associ-
ated with this load is called the ultimate moment.
Since the tensile strength of concrete is relatively small, it is generally disregarded en-
tirely in analyzing a beam. Consequently, the effective beam section is considered to
comprise the reinforcing steel and the concrete on the compression side of the neutral
axis, the concrete between these component areas serving merely as the ligature of the
member.
The following notational system is applied in ultimate-strength design: a = depth of
compression block, in (mm); c = distance from extreme compression fiber to neutral axis,
in (mm); 0 = capacity-reduction factor.
Where the subscript u is appended to a symbol, it signifies that the given quantity is
evaluated at ultimate load.
For simplicity (Fig. 2), designers assume that when the ultimate moment is attained at
a given section, there is a uniform stress in the concrete extending across a depth a, and
that/ = 0.85//, and a = k^c, where ^1 has the value stipulated in the ACI Code.
A reinforced-concrete beam has three potential modes of failure: crushing of the con-
crete, which is assumed to occur when ec reaches the value of 0.003; yielding of the steel,
which begins when/ reaches the value/,; and the simultaneous crushing of the concrete
and yielding of the steel. A beam that tends to fail by the third mode is said to be in bal-
anced design. If the value of/? exceeds that corresponding to balanced design (i.e., if there
is an excess of reinforcement), the beam tends to fail by crushing of the concrete. But if
the value of/? is less than that corresponding to balanced design, the beam tends to fail by
yielding of the steel.
Failure of the beam by the first mode would occur precipitously and without warning,
whereas failure by the second mode would occur gradually, offering visible evidence of
progressive failure. Therefore, to ensure that yielding of the steel would occur prior to
failure of the concrete, the ACI Code imposes an upper limit of Q.15pb on/?.
To allow for material imperfections, defects in workmanship, etc., the Code intro-
duces the capacity-reduction factor (/>. A section of the Code sets 0 = 0.90 with respect to
flexure and </> = 0.85 with respect to diagonal tension, bond, and anchorage.
The basic equations for the ultimate-strength design of a rectangular beam reinforced
solely in tension are

ing an area of 5.37 in2 (34.647 cm2). The beam is made of 2500-lb/in2 (17,237.5-kPa)
concrete, and the steel has a yield-point stress of 40,000 lb/in2 (275,800 kPa). Compute
the ultimate moment this beam may resist (a) without referring to any design tables and
without applying the basic equations of ultimate-strength design except those that are
readily apparent; (b) by applying the basic equations.

Calculation Procedure:

1. Compute the area of reinforcement for balanced design

Use the relation es =fy/Es = 40,000/29,000,000 = 0.00138. For balanced design, eld =
ej(ec + es) = 0.0037(0.003 + 0.00138) = 0.685. Solving for c by using the relation for c/d,
we find c = 13.36 in (339.344 mm). Also, a = k^c = 0.85(13.36) = 11.36 in (288.544 mm).
Then Tu = Cu = «6(0.85/; = 11.36(12)(0.85)(2500) = 290,000 Ib (1,289,920 N); A3 =
Tulfy = 290,000/40,000 = 7.25 in2 (46,777 cm2); and Q.75AS = 5.44 in2 (35.097 cm2). In
the present instance, A5 = 5.37 in2 (34.647 cm2). This is acceptable.

2. Compute the ultimate-moment capacity of this member

Thus Tn = Asfy = 5.37(40,000) = 215,000 Ib (956,320 N); Cu = 06(0.85/; = 25,50Oa =
215,000 Ib (956,320 N); a = 8.43 in (214.122 mm); Mu = </>Tu(d - a/2) = 0.90
(215,000)(19.5 - 8.43/2) = 2,960,000 in-lb (334,421 N-m). These two steps comprise the
solution to part a. The next two steps comprise the solution of part b.

3. Apply Eq. 10; ascertain whether the member satisfies the Code

Thus, qmax = 0.6375^(87,000)7(87,000 + fy) = 0.6375(0.85)(87/127) = 0.371; q =
[AJ(bd)]fc = [5.37/(12 x 19.5)]40/2.5 = 0.367. This is acceptable.

4. Compute the ultimate-moment capacity

Applying Eq. 5 yields Mn = <f>Asfyd(l - 0.59?) = 0.90(5.37)(40,000)(19.5)(1 - 0.59 x
0.367) = 2,960,000 in-lb (334,421 N-m). This agrees exactly with the result computed in
step 2.

DESIGN OFA RECTANGULAR BEAM

A beam on a simple span of 20 ft (6.1 m) is to carry a uniformly distributed live load of
1670 Ib/lin ft (24,372 N/m) and a dead load of 470 Ib/lin ft (6859 N/m), which includes
the estimated weight of the beam. Architectural details restrict the beam width to 12 in
(304.8 mm) and require that the depth be made as small as possible. Design the section,
using/; = 3000 lb/in2 (20,685 kPa) and/; = 40,000 lb/in2 (275,800 kPa).

Calculation Procedure:

1. Compute the ultimate load for which the member
is to be designed

The beam depth is minimized by providing the maximum amount of reinforcement per-
mitted by the Code. From the previous calculation procedure, #max = 0.371.
Use the load factors given in the Code: WDL = 470 Ib/lin ft (6859 N/m); WLL = 1670
Ib/lin ft (24,372 N/m); L = 20 ft (6.1 m). Then wu = 1.5(470) + 1.8(1670) = 3710 Ib/lin ft
(54,143 N/m); Mu = % (3710)(20)212 = 2,230,000 in-lb (251,945.4 N-m).

2. Establish the beam size

Solve Eq. 6 for d. Thus, d2 = Mul$bf'c

( c) Resultant

FIGURE 4

2. Compute the resultant force developed in the web and the
depth of the stress block in the web

Thus, Cuw = 328,000 - 275,400 = 52,600 Ib (233,964.8 N); m = depth of the stress block =
52,600/[2550(1O)] = 2.06 in (52.324 mm).

3. Evaluate the ultimate-moment capacity

Thus, Mu = 0.90[275,400(20.5 - 3) + 52,600(20.5 - 6 - 1.03)] = 4,975,000 in-lb
(562,075.5 N-m).

4. Determine if the reinforcement compiles with the Code

Let b' = width of web, in (mm); Asl = area of reinforcement needed to resist the compres-
sive force in the overhanging portion of the flange, in2 (cm2); As2 = area of reinforcement
needed to resist the compressive force in the remainder of the section, in2 (cm2). Then/?2
- As2/(b'd); Asl = 2550(6)(18 - 10)740,000 = 3.06 in2 (19.743 cm2); As2 = 8.20 - 3.06 =
5.14 in2 (33.163 cm2). Thenp2 - 5.147(10(20.5)] = 0.025.
A section of the ACI Code subjects the reinforcement ratio p2 to the same restriction
as that in a rectangular beam. By Eq. 8,/?25max = 0.15pb = 0.75(0.85)(0.85)(3/40)(87/127)
= 0.0278 > 0.025. This is acceptable.

CAPACITY OFAT BEAM OF GIVEN SIZE

The T beam in Fig. 5 is made of 3000-lb/in2 (20,685-kPa) concrete, and^ = 40,000 lb/in2
(275,800 kPa). Determine the ultimate-moment capacity of this member if it is reinforced
in tension only.

Calculation Procedure:

1. Compute CU1, Cu2finax, and smax

Let the subscript 1 refer to the overhanging portion of the flange and the subscript 2 refer
to the remainder of the compression zone. Then/c = 0.85(3000) = 2550 lb/in2 (17,582.3
kPa); CMl ='2550(5)(16 - 10) - 76,500 Ib (340,272 N). From the previous calculation
procedure, p2max = 0.0278. Then As2max = 0.0278(10)(19.5) = 5.42 in2 (34.970 cm2);

Q2 max = 5.42(40,000) = 216,800 Ib
(964,326.4 N); smax = 216,800/(10(255O)]
= 8.50 in (215.9 mm).

2. Compute the ultimate-
moment capacity

Thus, MMmax = 0.90(76,500(19.5 - 5/2) +
216,800(19.5 - 8.50/2)] = 4,145,000 in-lb
(468,300 N-m).

DESIGN OF REINFORCEMENT
INA TBEAM OF GIVEN SIZE

FIGURE 5

The T beam in Fig. 5 is to resist an ultimate moment of 3,960,000 in-lb (447,400.8 N-m).
Determine the required area of reinforcement, using/,' = 3000 lb/in2 (20,685 kPa) and/J, =
40,000 lb/in2 (275,800 kPa).

Calculation Procedure:

1. Obtain a moment not subject to reduction

From the previous calculation procedure, the ultimate-moment capacity of this member is
4,145,000 in-lb (468,300 N-m). To facilitate the design, divide the given ultimate moment
M11 by the capacity-reduction factor to obtain a moment MJ that is not subject to reduc-
tion. Thus M'u = 3,960,000/0.9 = 4,400,000 in-lb (497,112 N-m).

2. Compute the value of s associated with the given moment

From step 2 in the previous calculation procedure, MJ1 = 1,300,000 in-lb (146,874 N-m).
Then M J2= 4,400,000 - 1,300,000 = 3,100,000 in-lb (350,238 N-m). But MJ2 =
2550(10^(19.5-5/2), so s = 7.79 in (197.866 mm).

3. Compute the area of reinforcement

Thus, Cu2 = MJ2AW- 1As) = 3,100,0007(19.5 - 3.90) = 198,700 Ib (883,817.6 N). From
step 1 of the previous calculation procedure, C111 = 76,500 Ib (340,272 N); Tu = 76,500 +
198,700 = 275,200 Ib (1,224,089.6 N); As = 275,200/40,000 = 6.88 in2 (174.752 mm).

4. Verify the solution

To verify the solution, compute the ultimate-moment capacity of the member. Use the no-
tational system given in earlier calculation procedures. Thus, Cuf = 16(5)(2550) =
204,000 Ib (907,392 N); Cuw = 275,200 - 204,000 = 71,200 Ib (316,697.6 N); m =
71,200/[2550(1O)] = 2.79 in (70.866 mm); MM = 0.90 [204,000 (19.5 - 2.5) + 71,200(19.5
- 5 - 1.4O)] = 3,960,000 in-lb (447,400.8 N-m). Thus, the result is verified because the
computed moment equals the given moment.

REINFORCEMENTAREA FORA DOUBLY
REINFORCED RECTANGULAR BEAM

A beam that is to resist an ultimate moment of 690 ft-kips (935.6 kN-m) is restricted to a
14-in (355.6-mm) width and 24-in (609.6-mm) total depth. Using ft = 5000 lb/in2 and
fy = 50,000 lb/in2 (344,750 kPa), determine the area of reinforcement.

Calculation Procedure:

1. Compute the values of q^ qmax, and pmax for a singly
reinforced beam

As the following calculations will show, it is necessary to reinforce the beam both in ten-
sion and in compression. In Fig. 6, let A5 = area of tension reinforcement, in2 (cm2); A's =
area of compression reinforcement, in2 (cm2); d' = distance from compression face of
concrete to centroid of compression reinforcement, in (mm); fs = stress in tension steel,
lb/in2 (kPa);/' = stress in compression steel, lb/in2 (kPa); es= strain in compression steel;
p — As/(bd);p' = A's/(bd); q = pfylfc

3. Compute the value of ej under the balanced-design
ultimate moment

Compare this value with the strain at incipient yielding. By Eq. 3, cb = l.\$qbd/ki =
1.18(0.432)(20.5)/0.80 = 13.1 in (332.74 mm); e;/ec = (13.1 - 2.5)713.1 = 0.809; e/ =
0.809(0.003) = 0.00243; ey = 50/29,000 = 0.0017 < e/. The compression reinforcement
will therefore yield before the concrete fails, and/' -fy may be used.

4. Alternatively, test the compression steel for yielding

Apply

_ , 

P P 

0.85^/^(87,000)
//(87,000-JT) 

< 

>

If this relation obtains, the compression steel will yield. The value of the right-hand mem-
ber is 0.85(0.80)(5/50)(2.5/20.5)(87/37) = 0.0195. From the preceding calculations,/? -p'
= 0.0324 > 0.0195. This is acceptable.

5. Determine the areas of reinforcement

By Eq. 2, A3 = A's = qmj)dftlfy = 0.324(14)(20.5)(5/50) = 9.30 in2 (60.00 cm2); A3 =
CuAWy) = 74,400/[0.90(50,00O)] - 1.65 in2 (10.646 cm2); A3 = 9.30 + 1.65 = 10.95 in2
(70.649 cm2).

6. Verify the solution

Apply the following equations for the ultimate-moment capacity:

(4,-AMy 

a == 0.85/'* 

m,
(13)

So a = 9.30(50,000)/[0.85(5000)(14)] = 7.82 in (198.628 mm). Also,

Mu = 4>fy\(Aa

sion. The less precise and more conservative method restricts the shearing stress to a stip-
ulated value that is independent of the flexural stress.
For simplicity, the latter method is adopted here. A section of the Code sets </> = 0.85
with respect to the design of web reinforcement. Let vu = nominal ultimate shearing
stress, lb/in2 (kPa); vc = shearing stress resisted by concrete, lb/in2 (kPa); #J = shearing
stress resisted by the web reinforcement, lb/in2 (kPa); Av = total cross-sectional area of
stirrup, in2 (cm2); Vu = ultimate vertical shear at section, Ib (N); s = center-to-center spac-
ing of stirrups, in (mm).
The shearing-stress diagram for half-span is shown in Fig. 7. Establish the region AF
within which web reinforcement is required. The Code sets the allowable shearing stress
in the concrete at

The equation for nominal ultimate shearing stress is

vc = 2<Kfy-5 

« •-£ 

(15)

(16)

Then, vc = 2(0.85)(3000)°5 = 93 lb/in2 (641.2 kPa).
At the face of the support, Vu = 9(10,200) = 91,800 Ib (408,326.4 N); vu =
91,800/[ 15(22.5)] = 272 lb/in2 (1875.44 kPa). The slope of the shearing-stress diagram =
-272/108 = -2.52 Ib/(in2-in) (-0.684 kPa/mm). At distance d from the face of the support,
vu = 272 - 22.5(2.52) = 215 lb/in2 (1482.4 kPa); 0J = 215 - 93 = 122 lb/in2 (841.2 kPa).
Let E denote the section at which vu = vc. Then, AE = (272 - 93)/2.52 = 71 in (1803.4
mm). A section of the Code requires that web reinforcement be continued for a distance d
beyond the section where vu = vc

3. Select the stirrup size

Equate the spacing near the support to the minimum practical value, which is generally
considered to be 4 in (101.6 mm). The equation for stirrup spacing is

<K/y>-& 

(17)

Then Av = sv'ubl($fy = 4(122)(15)/[0.85(40,000)] = 0.215 in2 (1.3871 cm2). Since each
stirrup is bent into the form of a U, the total cross-sectional area is twice that of a straight
bar. Use no. 3 stirrups for which Av = 2(0.11) = 0.22 in2 (1.419 cm2).

4. Establish the maximum allowable stirrup spacing

Apply the criteria of the Code, or smax = d/4 ifv> 6<l>(fc')0-5. The right-hand member of
this inequality has the value 279 lb/in2 (1923.70 kPa), and this limit therefore does not ap-
ply. Then smax = d/2 = 11.25 in (285.75 mm), or ,smax = Av /(0.00156) = 0.22/[0.OO 15(15)]
= 9.8 in (248.92 mm). The latter limit applies, and the stirrup spacing will therefore be re-
stricted to 9 in (228.6 mm).

5. Locate the beam sections at which the required stirrup spacing
is 6 in (152.4 mm) and 9 in (228.6 mm)

Use Eq. 17. Then <f>Avfy/b = 0.85(0.22)(40,000)/15 = 499 lb/in (87.38 kN/m). At C: vj =
499/6 = 83 lb/in2 (572.3 kPa); vu = 83 + 93 = 176 lb/in2 (1213.52 kPa); AC = (272 -
176)72.52 = 38 in (965.2 mm). At D: v^ = 499/9 = 55 lb/in2 (379.2 kPa); vu = 55 + 93 =
148 lb/in2 (1020.46 kPa); AD = (272 - 148)72.52 = 49 in (1244.6 mm).

6. Devise a stirrup spacing conforming to the computed results

The following spacing, which requires 17 stirrups for each half of the span, is satisfactory
and conforms with the foregoing results:

DETERMINATION OF BOND STRESS

A beam of 4000-lb/in2 (27,580-kPa) concrete has an effective depth of 15 in (381 mm)
and is reinforced with four no. 7 bars. Determine the ultimate bond stress at a section
where the ultimate shear is 72 kips (320.3 kN). Compare this with the allowable stress.

Calculation Procedure:

1. Determine the ultimate shear flow hu

The adhesion of the concrete and steel must be sufficiently strong to resist the horizontal
shear flow. Let uu = ultimate bond stress, lb/in2 (kPa); Vu = ultimate vertical shear, Ib (N);

20 = sum of perimeters of reinforcing bars, in (mm). Then the ultimate shear flow at any
plane between the neutral axis and the reinforcing steel is hu = VJ(d-al2).
In conformity with the notational system of the working-stress method, the distance d
- all is designated asyW. Dividing the shear flow by the area of contact in a unit length
and introducing the capacity-reduction factor yield

(18)

A section of the ACI Code sets <f> = 0.85 with respect to bond, andy is usually assigned the
approximate value of 0.875 when this equation is used.

2. Calculate the bond stress

Thus, 20 = 11.0 in (279.4 mm), from the ACI Handbook. Then uu = 72,000/[0.85(11.0)
(0.875) x (15)] = 587 lb/in2 (4047.4 kPa).
The allowable stress is given in the Code as

but not above 800 lb/in2 (5516 kPa). Thus, wM a l l ow = 9.5(4,000)° V0.875 - 687 lb/in2
(4736.9 kPa).

DESIGN OF INTERIOR SPAN OF A
ONE-WAYSLAB

A floor slab that is continuous over several spans carries a live load of 120 Ib/ft2 (5745
N/m2) and a dead load of 40 Ib/ft2 (1915 N/m2), exclusive of its own weight. The clear
spans are 16 ft (4.9 m). Design the interior span, using/; = 3000 lb/in2 (20,685 kPa) and
fy = 50,000 lb/in2 (344,750 kPa).

Calculation Procedure:

1. Find the minimum thickness of the slab as governed by
the Code

Refer to Fig. 8. The maximum potential positive or negative moment may be found by ap-
plying the type of loading that will induce the critical moment and then evaluating this
moment. However, such an analysis is time-consuming. Hence, it is wise to apply the
moment equations recommended in the ACI Code whenever the span and loading condi-
tions satisfy the requirements given there. The slab is designed by considering a 12-in
(304.8-mm) strip as an individual beam, making b = 12 in (304.8 mm).
Assuming that L— 17 ft (5.2 m), we know the minimum thickness of the slab is tmin =
L/35 = 17(12)735 = 5.8 in (147.32 mm).

2. Assuming a slab thickness, compute the ultimate load
on the member

Tentatively assume t = 6 in (152.4 mm). Then the beam weight = (6/12)(150 Ib/ft3 = 75
Ib/lin ft (1094.5 N/m). Also, wtt - 1.5(40 + 75) + 1.8(120) = 390 Ib/lin ft (5691.6 N/m).

3. Compute the shearing stress associated with the assumed
beam size

From the Code for an interior span, Vu = V2W14L' = !/2(390)(16) = 3120 Ib (13,877.8 N); d =
6 - 1 = 5 in (127 mm); vu = 3120/[12(5)] = 52 lb/in2 (358.54 kPa); vc = 93 lb/in2 (641.2
kPa). This is acceptable.

4. Compute the two critical moments

Apply the appropriate moment equations. Compare the computed moments with the mo-
ment capacity of the assumed beam size to ascertain whether the size is adequate. Thus,
M,,neg = (VWw11Z/2 = (1/n)(390)(16)2(12) = 108,900 in-lb (12,305.5 N-m), where the value
12 converts the dimension to inches. Then Mupos = 1AtW11L'2 = 74,900 in-lb (8462.2 N-m).
By Eq. 10, qmax = 0.6375(0.85)(87/137) = 0.344. By Eq. 6, MMallow = 0.90(12)
(5)2(3000)(0.344)(0.797) = 222,000 in-lb (25,081.5 N-m). This is acceptable. The slab
thickness will therefore be made 6 in (152.4 mm).

5. Compute the area of reinforcement associated with each
critical moment

By Eq. 7, bdfc = 12(5)(2.55) = 153.0 kips (680.54 kN); then 2bfcMunes/(l> =
2(12)(2.55)(108.9)/0.90 = 7405 kips2 (146,505.7 kN2); Asnes = [153.0 - (153.02 -
7405)°-5]/50 = 0.530 in2 (3.4196 cm2). Similarly, Aspos = 0.353 in2 (2.278 cm2).

6. Select the reinforcing bars, and locate the bend points

For positive reinforcement, use no. 4 trussed bars 13 in (330.2 mm) on centers, alternating
with no. 4 straight bars 13 in (330.2 mm) on centers, thus obtaining A5 = 0.362 in2 (2.336
cm2).
For negative reinforcement, supplement the trussed bars over the support with no. 4
straight bars 13 in (330.2 mm) on centers, thus obtaining A5 = 0.543 in2 (3.502 cm2).
The trussed bars are usually bent upward at the fifth points, as shown in Fig. 8a. The
reinforcement satisfies a section of the ACI Code which requires that "at leas t. . . one-
fourth the positive moment reinforcement in continuous beams shall extend along the
same face of the beam into the support at least 6 in (152.4 mm)."

7. Investigate the adequacy of the reinforcement beyond
the bend points

In accordance with the Code, Amin = At = 0.0020^ = 0.0020(12)(6) = 0.144 in2 (0.929
cm2).
A section of the Code requires that reinforcing bars be extended beyond the point at
which they become superfluous with respect to flexure a distance equal to the effective
depth or 12 bar diameters, whichever is greater. In the present instance, extension =
12(0.5) = 6 in (152.4 mm). Therefore, the trussed bars in effect terminate as positive rein-
forcement at section A (Fig. 8). Then Z//5 = 3.2 ft (0.98 m); AM = 8 - 3.2 - 0.5 = 4.3 ft
(1.31m).
The conditions immediately to the left of A are Mu = M14 pos - Vzwu(AM)2 = 74,900 -
1/2(390)(4.3)2(12) = 31,630 in-lb (3573.56 N-m); Aspos = 6.181 in2 (1.168 cm2); q =
0.181(50)/[12(5)(3)] = 0.0503. By Eq. 5, MMa l low = 0.90(0.181)(50,000)(5)(0.970) =
39,500 in-lb (4462.7 N-m). This is acceptable.
Alternatively, Eq. 11 may be applied to obtain the following conservative approxima-
tion: MM>allow = 74,900(0.181)70.353 = 38,400 in-lb (4338.43 N-m).
The trussed bars in effect terminate as negative reinforcement at B, where O'E = 3.2-
0.33 - 0.5 = 2.37 ft (72.23 m). The conditions immediately to the right of B are \MU

FIGURE 9. Analysis of two-way slab by mechanism method.

Calculation Procedure:

1. Draw line GH perpendicular to AE at E; express distances b
and c in terms of a

Consider a slab to be reinforced in orthogonal directions. If the reinforcement in one di-
rection is identical with that in the other direction, the slab is said to be isotropically rein-
forced; if the reinforcements differ, the slab is described as orthogonally anisotropic. In
the former case, the capacity of the slab is identical in all directions; in the latter case, the
capacity has a unique value in every direction. In this instance, assume that the slab size is
excessive with respect to balanced design, the result being that the failure of the slab will
be characterized by yielding of the steel.
In a steel beam, a plastic hinge forms at a section; in a slab, a plastic hinge is assumed
to form along a straight line, termed a yield line. It is plausible to assume that by virtue of
symmetry of loading and support conditions the slab in Fig. 9a will fail by the formation
of a central yield line EF and diagonal yield lines such as AE, the ultimate moment at
these lines being positive. The ultimate unit moment mu is the moment acting on a unit
length.
Although it is possible to derive equations that give the location of the yield lines, this
procedure is not feasible because the resulting equations would be unduly cumbersome.
The procedure followed in practice is to assign a group of values to the distance a and to
determine the corresponding values of mu. The true value of mu is the highest one ob-
tained. Either the static or mechanism method of analysis may be applied; the latter will
be applied here.
Expressing the distances b and c in terms of a gives tan a = 6/a = AE/b =

During the virtual displacement, the portions of the slab bounded by the yield lines and
the supports rotate as planes. Refer to Fig. 9b and c: B1 = A/6; O2 = 2B1= A/3 = 0.333A; B3
= A/Z>; O4 = A/c; O5 = A ( l /6 + lie) = [M(AE)}(6la + a/6).

3. Select a trial value of a, and evaluate the distances and angles

Using a = 4.5 ft (1.37 m) as the trial value, we find AE = (a2 + 62)0-5 = 7.5 ft (2.28 m);
b = 5.63 ft (1.716 m); c = 10 ft (3.0 m); O5 = (A/7.5)(6/4.5 + 4.5/6) = 0.278A.

4. Develop an equation for the external work WE performed by the
uniform load on a surface that rotates about a horizontal axis

In Fig. 10, consider that the surface ABC rotates about axis AB through an angle B while
carrying a uniform load of w lb/ft2 (kPa). For the elemental area dAS9 the deflection, total
load, and external work are d = jc0; dW= w

The allowable flexural stress in the concrete and the value of w, which are functions of
the ultimate strength/,', are given in the ACI Code, as is the allowable flexural stress in
the steel. In all instances in the following procedures, the assumption is that the reinforce-
ment is intermediate-grade steel having an allowable stress of 20,000 lb/in2 (137,900
kPa).
Consider that the load on a beam is gradually increased until a limiting stress is in-
duced. A beam that is so proportioned that the steel and concrete simultaneously attain
their limiting stress is said to be in balanced design. For each set of values offc
f and^,
there is a corresponding set of values of K9 k, j, and p associated with balanced design.
These values are recorded in Table 1.

balanced design

In Fig. 12, AB represents the stress
line of the transformed section for a
beam in balanced design. If the area of
reinforcement is increased while the
width and depth remain constant, the
neutral axis is depressed to O'', and
A'O'B represents the stress line under
the allowable load. But if the width is
increased while the depth and area of re-
inforcement remain constant, the neutral
axis is elevated to 0", and AO'B' repre-
sents the stress line under the allowable
load. This analysis leads to these con-
clusions: If the reinforcement is in ex-
cess of that needed for balanced design,
the concrete is the first material to reach
its limiting stress under a gradually in-
creasing load. If the beam size is in ex-
cess °^ ^at nee(*e(* f°r balanced design,
the steel is the first material to reach its

STRESSES IN A RECTANGULAR BEAM

A beam of 2500-lb/in2 (17,237.5-kPa) concrete has a width of 12 in (304.8 mm) and an
effective depth of 19.5 in (495.3 mm). It is reinforced with one no. 9 and two no. 7 bars.
Determine the flexural stresses caused by a bending moment of 62 ft-kips (84.1 kN-m) (a)
without applying the basic equations of reinforced-concrete beam design; (b) by applying
the basic equations.

Calculation Procedure:

1. Record the pertinent beam data

Thus/; = 2500 lb/in2 (17,237.5 kPa); /. n = 10; A3 = 2.20 in2 (14.194 cm2); nAs = 22.0 in2
(141.94 cm2). Then M= 62,000(12) = 744,000 in-lb (84,057.1 N-m).

2. Transform the given section to an equivalent homogeneous
section, as in Fig. 13b

3. Locate the neutral axis of the member

The neutral axis coincides with the centroidal axis of the transformed section. To locate
the neutral axis, set the static moment of the transformed area with respect to its cen-
troidal axis equal to zero: l2(kdf/2 - 22.0(19.5 - kd) = O; kd = 6.82; d - kd = 12.68 in
(322.072 mm).

4. Calculate the moment of inertia of the transformed section

Then evaluate the flexural stresses by applying the stress equation: /= (1/3)(12)(6.82)3 +
22.0(12.68)2 = 4806 in4 (200,040.6 cm4);/c = MMII = 744,000(6.82)74806 = 1060 lb/in2
(7308.7 kPa);/5, = 10(744,00O)(12.68)74806 = 19,600 lb/in2

5. Alternatively, evaluate the stresses by computing the resultant
forces C and T

Thus jd = 19.5 - 6.82/3 = 17.23 in (437.642 mm); C = T=MfJd = 744,000/17.23 = 43,200
Ib (192,153.6 N). But C= 1/2/c(6.82)12; :.fc = 1060 lb/in2 (7308.7 kPa); and T= 2.20/5; /.
fs = 19,600 lb/in2 (135,142 kPa). This concludes part a of the solution. The next step con-
stitutes the solution to part b.

6. Compute pn and then apply the basic equations
in the proper sequence

Thus p = As/(bd) = 2.20/[12(19.5)] = 0.00940; pn = 0.0940. Then by Eq. 30, k = [0.188 +
(0.094)2]0 5 - 0.094 = 0.350. By Eq. 22,j = 1 - 0.350/3 = 0.883. By Eq. 23,/c = 2MI(lqbf)
= 2(744,000)/[0.350(0.883)(12)(19.5)2] = 1060 lb/in2 (7308.7 kPa). By Eq. 25, fs =
MI(AJd) = 744,000/[2.20(0.883)(19.5)] = 19,600 lb/in2 (135,142 kPa).

CAPACITY OFA RECTANGULAR BEAM

The beam in Fig. I4a is made of 2500-lb/in2 (17,237.5-kPa) concrete. Determine the flex-
ural capacity of the member (a) without applying the basic equations of reinforced-
concrete beam design; (b) by applying the basic equations.

Calculation Procedure:

1. Record the pertinent beam data

Thus,// = 2500 lb/in2 (17,237.5 kPa); /./ca l low = 1125 lb/in2 (7756.9 kPa); n = 10; A5 =
3.95 in2 (25.485 cm2); nAs = 39.5 in2 (254.85 cm2).

2. Locate the centroidal axis of the transformed section

Thus, l6(kd)2/2 - 39.5(23.5 - kd) = O; kd = 8.58 in (217.93 mm); d - kd = 14.92 in
(378.968 mm).

3. Ascertain which of the two allowable stresses governs the
capacity of the member

For this purpose, assume th a t/ = 1125 lb/in2 (7756.9 kPa). By proportion, fs =
10(1125)(14.92/8.58) = 19,560 lb/in2 (134,866 kPa) < 20,000 lb/in2 (137,900 kPa).
Therefore, concrete stress governs.

4. Calculate the allowable bending moment

TJms9 Jd= 23.5 - 8.58/3 = 20.64 in (524.256 mm); M= Qd= 1X2(1125)(16)(8.58)(20.64) =
1,594,000 in-lb (180,090.1 N-m); or M = Tjd = 3.95(19,560)(20.64) = 1,594,000 in-lb
(180,090.1 N-m). This concludes part a of the solution. The next step comprises part b.

5. Compute p and compare with pb to identify
the controlling stress

Thus, from Table l,pb = 0.0101; then;? =Asl(bd) = 3.95/[16(23.5)] = 0.0105>/?6 There-
fore, concrete stress governs.
Applying the basic equations in the proper sequence yieldspn = 0.1050; by Eq. 30, k =
[0.210 + 0.1052]05 - 0.105 = 0.365; by Eq. 24, M= (1/6)(1125)(0.365)(2.635)(16)(23.5)2
= 1,593,000 in-lb (179,977.1 N-m). This agrees closely with the previously computed val-
ue of M.

DESIGN OF REINFORCEMENT IN A
RECTANGULAR BEAM OF GIVEN SIZE

A rectangular beam of 4000-lb/in2 (27,580-kPa) concrete has a width of 14 in (355.6 mm)
and an effective depth of 23.5 in (596.9 mm). Determine the area of reinforcement if the
beam is to resist a bending moment of (a) 220 ft-kips (298.3 kN-m); (b) 200 ft-kips (271.2
kN'm).

Calculation Procedure:

1. Calculate the moment capacity of this member
at balanced design

Record the following values:/callow = 1800 lb/in2 (12,411 kPa); n = 8. From Table I9 jb =
0.860; Kb = 324 lb/in2 (2234.6 kPa); M^^bd2 = 324(14)(23.5)2 = 2,505,000 in-lb
(283,014.9 N-m).

2. Determine which material will be stressed to capacity under
the stipulated moment

For part a, M= 220,000(12) = 2,640,000 in-lb (3,579,840 N-m) > Mb. This result signifies
that the beam size is deficient with respect to balanced design, and the concrete will there-
fore be stressed to capacity.

3. Apply the basic equations in proper sequence to obtain A3

By Eq. 24, *(3 - k) = 6M/(fcbf) = 6(2,640,000)/[1800(14)(23.5)2] = 1.138; A:= 0.446. By
Eq. 29, p = P/[2n(l - k)] = 0.4462/[ 16(0.554)] = 0.0224; As = pbd = 0.0224(14)(23.5) =
7.37 in2 (47.55 lcm2).

4. Verify the result by evaluating the flexural capacity
of the member

For part b, compute As by the exact method and then describe the approximate method
used in practice.

5. Determine which material will be stressed to capacity under
the stipulated moment

Here M= 200,000(12) = 2,400,000 in-lb (3,254,400 N-m) < Mb. This result signifies that
the beam size is excessive with respect to balanced design, and the steel will therefore be
stressed to capacity.

6. Apply the basic equations in proper sequence to obtain A8

By using Eq. 27, #(3 - K)/(I -k) = 6nMI(fJbf) = 6(8)(2,400,000)/[20,000(14)(23.5)2] =
0.7448; K = 0.411. By Eq. 22, j = 1 - 0.411/3 = 0.863. By Eq. 25, A5 = Ml(fjd) =
2,400,000/[20,000(0.863)(23.5)] = 5.92 in2 (38. 196 cm2).

7. Verify the result by evaluating the flexural capacity
of this member

The value o f/ obtained in step 6 differs negligibly from the value jb = 0.860. Consequent-
ly, in those instances where the beam size is only moderately excessive with respect to
balanced design, the practice is to consider that7 =jb and to solve Eq. 25 directly on this
basis. This practice is conservative, and it obviates the need for solving a cubic equation,
thus saving time.

DESIGN OFA RECTANGULAR BEAM

A beam on a simple span of 13 ft (3.9 m) is to carry a uniformly distributed load, exclu-
sive of its own weight, of 3600 Ib/lin ft (52,538.0 N/m) and a concentrated load of 17,000
Ib (75,616 N) applied at midspan. Design the section, using/; = 3000 lb/in2 (20,685 kPa).

Calculation Procedure:

1. Record the basic values associated with balanced design

There are two methods of allowing for the beam weight: (a) to determine the bending mo-
ment with an estimated beam weight included; (b) to determine the beam size required to
resist the external loads alone and then increase the size slightly. The latter method is used
here.
From Table 1, Kb = 223 lb/in2 (1537.6 kPa);/^ = 0.0128;^ = 0.874.

2. Calculate the maximum moment caused by the external loads

Thus, the maximum moment Me = 1APL + Y*wL2 = 1X4(17,00O)(13)(12) + !/8(360O)
(13)2(12) = 1,576,000 in-lb (178,056.4 N-m).

3. Establish a trial beam size

Thus, bd2 = M/Kb = 1,576,000/223 = 7067 in3 (115,828.1 cm3). Setting b = (2A)d, we find
b - 14.7 in (373.38 mm), d = 22.0 in (558.8 mm). Try b = 15 in (381 mm) and d= 22.5 in
(571.5 mm), producing an overall depth of 25 in (635 mm) if the reinforcing bars may be
placed in one row.

4. Calculate the maximum bending moment with the beam weight
included; determine whether the trial section is adequate

Thus, beam weight = 15(25)(150)/144 = 391 Ib/lin ft (5706.2 N/m); Mw = (%)(391)
(13)2(12) = 99,000 in-lb (11,185.0 N-m); M = 1,576,000 + 99,000 = 1,675,000 in-lb
(189,241.5 N-m); Mb = Kbbcf- = 223(15)(22.5)2 = 1,693,000 in-lb (191,275.1 N-m). The
trial section is therefore satisfactory because it has adequate capacity.

5. Design the reinforcement

Since the beam size is slightly excessive with respect to balanced design, the steel will be
stressed to capacity under the design load. Equation 25 is therefore suitable for this calcu-
lation. Thus, A3 = MI(JJd) - 1,675,000/[20,000(0.874)(22.5)] = 4.26 in2 (27.485 cm2).
An alternative method of calculating A8 is to apply the value of pb while setting the
beam width equal to the dimension actually required to produce balanced design. Thus,
A3 = 0.0128(15)(1675)(22.5)/1693 = 4.27 in2 (27.550 cm2).
Use one no. 10 and three no. 9 bars, for which A3 = 4.27 in2 (27.550 cm2) and 6min =
12.0 in (304.8 mm).

6. Summarize the design

Thus, beam size is 15 * 25 in (381 x 635 mm); reinforcement is with one no. 10 and three
no. 9 bars.

DESIGN OF WEB REINFORCEMENT

A beam 14 in (355.6 mm) wide with an 18.5-in (469.9-mm) effective depth carries a uni-
form load of 3.8 kips/lin ft (55.46 N/m) and a concentrated midspan load of 2 kips (8.896
kN). The beam is simply supported, and the clear distance between supports is 13 ft (3.9

m). Using^' = 3000 lb/in2 (20,685 kPa) and an allowable stress^, in the stirrups of 20,000
lb/in2 (137,900 kPa), design web reinforcement in the form of vertical U stirrups.

Calculation Procedure:

1. Construct the shearing-stress diagram for half-span

The design of web reinforcement by the working-stress method parallels the design by the
ultimate-strength method, given earlier. Let v = nominal shearing stress, lb/in2 (kPa);
vc = shearing stress resisted by concrete; v' = shearing stress resisted by web reinforce-
ment.
The ACI Code provides two alternative methods of computing the shearing stress that
may be resisted by the concrete. The simpler method is used here. This sets

The equation for nominal shearing stress is

f >c= l . l ( / c T5 

'- id 

(33)

(34)

The shearing-stress diagram for a half-span is shown in Fig. 15. Establish the region
AD within which web reinforcement is required. Thus, vc = 1.1(3000)°5 = 60 lb/in2 (413.7
kPa). At the face of the support, V= 6.5(3800) + 1000 = 25,700 Ib (114,313.6 N); v =
25,700/[14(18.5)] = 99 lb/in2 (682.6 kPa).
At midspan, V= 1000 Ib (4448 N); v = 4 lb/in2 (27.6 kPa); slope of diagram = -(99 -
4)/78 = -1.22 Ib/(in2-in) (-0.331 kPa/mm). At distance d from the face of the support, v =
99 - 18.5(1.22) = 76 lb/in2 (524.02 kPa); v' = 76 - 60 = 16 lb/in2 (110.3 kPa); AC = (99 -
60)71.22 = 32 in (812.8 mm); AD = AC + d= 32 + 18.5 = 50.5 in (1282.7 mm).

2. Check the beam size for compliance with the Code

Thus, vmax = 5(fc)Q-5 - 274 lb/in2 (1889.23 kPa) > 76 lb/in2 (524.02 kPa). This is accept-
able.

3. Select the stirrup size

Use the method given earlier in the ultimate-strength calculation procedure to select the
stirrup size, establish the maximum allowable spacing, and devise a satisfactory spacing.

CAPACITY OFAT BEAM

Determine the flexural capacity of the T beam in Fig. 16a, using/,' = 3000 lb/in2 (20,685
kPa).

Calculation Procedure:

1. Record the pertinent beam values

The neutral axis of a T beam often falls within the web. However, to simplify the analy-
sis, the resisting moment developed by the concrete lying between the neutral axis and the
flange is usually disregarded. Let Af denote the flange area. The pertinent beam values are
/c,aiiow = 1350 lb/in2 (9308.3 kPa); n = 9;kb = 0.378; nAs = 9(4.00) = 36.0 in2 (232.3 cm2).

2. Tentatively assume that the neutral axis lies in the web

Locate this axis by taking static moments with respect to the top line. Thus Af= 5(16) =
80 in2 (516.2 cm2); M= [80(2.5) + 36.0(21.5)]/(80 + 36.0) = 8.40 in (213.36 mm).

3. Identify the controlling stress

Thus &= 8.40/21.5 = 0.391 > kb; therefore, concrete stress governs.

4. Calculate the allowable bending moment

Using Fig. 16c, we see/cl = 1350(3.40)/8.40 = 546 lb/in2 (3764.7 kPa); C= 1X2(SO)(HSO +
546) = 75,800 Ib (337,158.4 N). The action line of this resultant force lies at the centroidal
axis of the stress trapezoid. Thus, z = (5/3)(1350 + 2 x 546)/(1350 + 546) = 2.15 in (54.61
mm); or z = (5A) (8.40 + 2 x 3.40)/(8.40 + 3.40) = 2.15 in (54.61 mm); M = Qd =
75,800(19.35) - 1,467,000 in-lb (165,741 N-m).

(c) Stresses and resultant forces

5. Alternatively, calculate the allowable bending moment by
assuming that the flange extends to the neutral axis

Then apply the necessary correction. Let C1 = resultant compressive force if the flange
extended to the neutral axis, Ib (N); C2 = resultant compressive force in the imaginary ex-
tension of the flange, Ib (N). Then C1 = 1X2(1350)(16)(8.40) = 90,720 Ib (403,522.6 N); C2
- 90,720(3.40/8.4O)2 = 14,860 Ib (66,097.3 N); M= 90,720(21.5 - 8.40/3) - 14,860(21.5
- 5 - 3.40/3) = 1,468,000 in-lb (165,854.7 Nm).

DESIGNOFA TBEAM HAVING CONCRETE
STRESSED TO CAPACITY

A concrete girder of 2500-lb/in2 (17,237.5-kPa) concrete has a simple span of 22 ft (6.7
m) and is built integrally with a 5-in (127-mm) slab. The girders are spaced 8 ft (2.4 m) on
centers; the overall depth is restricted to 20 in (508 mm) by headroom requirements. The
member carries a load of 4200 Ib/lin ft (61,294.4 N/m), exclusive of the weight of its web.
Design the section, using tension reinforcement only.

Calculation Procedure:

1. Establish a tentative width of web

Since the girder is built integrally with the slab that it supports, the girder and slab consti-
tute a structural entity in the form of a T beam. The effective flange width is established
by applying the criteria given in the ACI Code, and the bending stress in the flange is as-
sumed to be uniform across a line parallel to the neutral axis. Let Af= area of flange in2
(cm2); b = width of flange, in (mm); b' = width of web, in (mm); t = thickness of flange,
in (mm); s = center-to-center spacing of girders.
To establish a tentative width of web, try b' = 14 in (355.6 mm). Then the weight of
web - 14(15)(150)/144 = 219, say 220 Ib/lin ft (3210.7 N/m); w = 4200 + 220 = 4420
Ib/lin ft (64,505.0 N/m).
Since two rows of bars are probably required, d = 20 - 3.5 = 16.5 in (419.1 mm). The
critical shear value is V = w(0.5L - d) = 4420(11 - 1.4) = 42,430 Ib (188,728.7 N);
v = V/b'd = 42,430/[l4(l6.5)] = 184 lb/in2 (1268.7 kPa). From the Code, vmax - 5(/c')°-5 =
250 lb/in2 (1723.8 kPa). This is acceptable.
Upon designing the reinforcement, consider whether it is possible to reduce the width
of the web.

2. Establish the effective width of the flange according
to the Code

Thus, 1AL = 1A(22)() = 66 in (1676.4 mm); I6t + bf = 16(5) + 14 = 94 in (2387.6 mm);
s = 8(12) - 96 in (2438.4 mm); therefore b = 66 in (1676.4 mm).

3. Compute the moment capacity of the member
at balanced design

Compare the result with the moment in the present instance to identify the controlling
stress. With Fig. 16 as a guide, kbd = 0.360(16.5) - 5.94 in (150.876 mm); Af= 5(66) =
330 in2 (2129.2 cm2); /cl = 1125(0.94)75.94 = 178 lb/in2 (1227.3 kPa); Cb = Tb =
1X2(SSO)(1125 + 178) = 215,000 Ib (956,320 N); zb = (5X3)(5.94 + 2 x 0.94)7(5.94 + 0.94) -
1.89 in (48.0 mm);yW = 14.61 in (371.094 mm); Mb = 215,000(14.61) - 3,141,000 in-lb
(354,870.2 N-m); M= (1X8)(4420)(22)2(12) = 3,209,000 in-lb (362,552.8 N-m).

The beam size is slightly deficient with re-
spect to balanced design, and the concrete will
therefore be stressed to capacity under the stip-
ulated load. In Fig. 17, let AOB represent the
stress line associated with balanced design and
A'O'B represent the stress line in the present
instance. (The magnitude QiAA' is exaggerat-
ed for clarity.)

4. Develop suitable equations for
the beam

Refer to Fig. 17:

(36)

5. Apply the equations from step 4

Thus, M-Mb = 68,000 in-lb (7682.6 N-m). By Eq. 36, Jt = 68,000(6)(16.5)/[66(25)(49.5 -
1O)] = 103 lb/in2 (710.2 kPa);/5 = 20,000 - 10(103) = 18,970 lb/in2 (130,798.2 kPa). By
Eq. 35, T= 215,000 + 66(25)( 103)733 = 220,200 Ib (979,449.6 N).

6. Design the reinforcement; establish the web width

Thus A8 -220,200/18,970= 11.61 in2 (74.908 cm2). Use five no. 11 and three no. 10 bars,
placed in two rows. Then A3 = 11.61 in2 (74.908 cm2); 6'min = 14.0 in (355.6 mm). It is
therefore necessary to maintain the 14-in (355.6-mm) width.

7. Summarize the design

Width of web: 14 in (355.6 mm); reinforcement: five no. 11 and three no. 10 bars.

8. Verify the design by computing the capacity of the member

Thus nAs = 116.1 in2 (749.08 cm2); kd= [330(2.5) + 116.1(16.5)]/(330 + 116.1) = 6.14 in
(155.956 mm); J t= 6.14/16.5 = 0.372> kb

Calculation Procedure:

1. Identify the controlling stress

Thus, M= (1/8)(4100)(22)2(12) = 2,977,000 in-lb (336,341.5 N-m). From the previous cal-
culation procedure, Mb = 3,141,000 in-lb (354,870.2 N-m). Since Mb > M, the beam size is
slightly excessive with respect to balanced design, and the steel will therefore be stressed
to capacity under the stipulated load.

2. Compute the area of reinforcement

As an approximation, this area may be found by applying the value ofjd associated with
balanced design, although it is actually slightly larger. From the previous calculation pro-
cedure,^ = 14.61 in (371.094 mm). Then A5 = 2,977,000/[20,000(14.6I)] = 10.19 in2
(65.746 cm2).

3. Verify the design by computing the member capacity

Thus, nAs = 101.9 in2 (657.46 cm2); kd = (330 x 2.5 + 101.9 x 16.5)7(330 + 101.9) = 5.80
in (147.32 mm); z = (5/3)(5.80 + 2 x 0.80)7(5.80 + 0.80) = 1.87 in (47.498 mm); Jd= 14.63
in (371.602 mm); Mallow = 10.19(20,000)(14.63) = 2,982,000 in-lb (336,906.4 N-m). This
is acceptable.

REINFORCEMENT FOR DOUBLY
REINFORCED RECTANGULAR BEAM

A beam of 4000-lb/in2 (27,580-kPa) concrete that will carry a bending moment of 230
ft-kips (311.9 kN-m) is restricted to a 15-in (381-mm)'width and a 24-in (609.6-mm) total
depth. Design the reinforcement.

Calculation Procedure:

1. Record the pertinent beam data

In Fig. 18, where the imposed moment is substantially in excess of that corresponding to
balanced design, it is necessary to reinforce the member in compression as well as ten-
sion. The loss in concrete area caused by the presence of the compression reinforcement
may be disregarded.
Since plastic flow generates a transfer of compressive stress from the concrete to the

FIGURE 18. Doubly reinforced beam.

steel, the ACI Code provides that "in doubly reinforced beams and slabs, an effective
modular ratio of 2n shall be used to transform the compression reinforcement and com-
pute its stress, which shall not be taken as greater than the allowable tensile stress." This
procedure is tantamount to considering that the true stress in the compression reinforce-
ment is twice the value obtained by assuming a linear stress distribution.
Let A5 - area of tension reinforcement, in2 (cm2); A's = area of compression reinforce-
ment, in2 (cm2); fs = stress in tension reinforcement, lb/in2 (kPa);/' = stress in compres-
sion reinforcement, lb/in2 (kPa);<C" = resultant force in compression reinforcement, Ib
(N); M1 = moment capacity of member if reinforced solely in tension to produce balanced
design; M2 = incremental moment capacity resulting from use of compression reinforce-
ment.
The data recorded for the beam are/c = 1800 lb/in2 (12.411 kPa); n = S;Kb = 324 lb/in2
(2234.0 kPa); kb = 0.419; jb = 0.860; M= 230,000(12) = 2,760,000 in-lb (311,824.8 N-m).

2. Ascertain whether one row of tension bars will suffice

Assume tentatively that the presence of the compression reinforcement does not apprecia-
bly alter the value of/ Then// = 0.860(21.5) = 18.49 in (469.646 mm); A3 = Ml(fjd) =
2,760,000/[20,000( 18.49)] = 7.46 in2 (48.132 cm2). This area of steel cannot be accom-
modated in the 15-in (3 81-mm) beam width, and two rows of bars are therefore required.

3. Evaluate the moments M1 and M2

Thus, d = 24 - 3.5 = 20.5 in (520.7 mm); M1 = KJ>f = 324(15)(20.5)2 = 2,040,000 in-lb
(230,479.2 N-m); M2 = 2,760,000 - 2,040,000 = 720,000 in-lb (81,345.6 N-m).

4. Compute the forces in the reinforcing steel

For convenience, assume that the neutral axis occupies the same position as it would in
the absence of compression reinforcement. For M1, arm =jyd = 0.860(20.5) = 17.63 in
(447.802 mm); for M2, arm = 20.5 - 2.5 = 18.0 in (457.2 mm); T= 2,040,000/17.63 +
720,000/18.0 = 155,700 Ib (692,553.6 N); C = 40,000 Ib (177,920 N).

5. Compute the areas of reinforcement and select the bars

Thus A3 = TIf8 = 155,700/20,000 = 7.79 in2 (50.261 cm2); kd = 0.419(20.5) = 8.59 in
(218.186 mm); d - kd = 11.91 in (302.514 mm). By proportion, fs' = 2(20,000)
(6.09)/11.91 = 20,500 lb/in2 (141,347.5 kPa); therefore, set// - 20,000 lb/in2 (137,900
kPa). Then, A3 = CIf8' = 40,000/20,000 = 2.00 in2 (12.904 cm2). Thus tension steel: five
no. 11 bars, As = 7.80 in2 (50.326 cm2); compression steel: two no. 9 bars, As = 2.00 in2
(12.904 cm2).

DEFLECTION OFA CONTINUOUS BEAM

The continuous beam in Fig. I9a and b carries a total load of 3.3 kips/lin ft (48.16 kN/m).
When it is considered as a T beam, the member has an effective flange width of 68 in
(1727.2 mm). Determine the deflection of the beam upon application of full live load, us-
ing// = 2500 lb/in2 (17,237.5 kPa) and/, = 40,000 lb/in2 (275,800 kPa).

Calculation Procedure:

1. Record the areas of reinforcement

At support: A3 = 4.43 in2 (28.582 cm2) (top); A3 = 1.58 in2 (10.194 cm2) (bottom). At cen-
ter: A5 = 3.16 in2 (20.388 cm2) (bottom).

2. Construct the banding-moment diagram

Apply the ACI equation for maximum midspan moment. Refer to Fig. 19c: M1 =
(Ys)wL'2 = (1/8)3.3(22)2 - 200 ft-kips (271.2 kN-m); M2 = (Vi6)WZ'2 = 100 ft-kips (135.6
kN-m); M3 = 100 ft-kips (135.6 kN-m).

3. Determine upon what area the moment of inertia should
be based

Apply the criterion set forth in the ACI Code to determine whether the moment of inertia
is to be based on the transformed gross section or the transformed cracked section. At the
support/^ = 4.43(40,000)/[14(20.5)] = 617 > 500. Therefore, use the cracked section.

4. Determine the moment of inertia of the transformed cracked
section at the support

Refer to Fig. I9d: nAs = 10(4.43) = 44.3 in2 (285.82 cm2); (n - I)A5 = 9(1.58) = 14.2 in2
(91.62 cm2). The static moment with respect to the neutral axis is Q = - Yi(My2) +
44.3(20.5 -y)- I4.2(y - 2.5) = O; y = 8.16 in (207.264 mm). The moment of inertia with
respect to the neutral axis is I1 = (1X3)14(8.16)3 + 14.2(8.16 - 2.5)2 + 44.3(20.5 - 8.16)2 =
9737 in4 (40.53 dm4).

5. Calculate the moment of inertia of the transformed cracked
section at the center

Referring to Fig. I9e and assuming tentatively that the neutral axis falls within the flange,
we see nAs = 10(3.16) = 31.6 in2 (203.88 cm2). The static moment with respect to the neu-
tral axis is Q = l/2(68y2) - 31.6(20.5 -y) = O; y = 3.92 in (99.568 mm). The neutral axis
therefore falls within the flange, as assumed. The moment of inertia with respect to the
neutral axis is I2 = 0/3)68(3.92)3 + 31.6(20.5 - 3.92)2 = 10,052 in4 (41.840 dm4).

6. Calculate the deflection at midspan

Use the equation

L'2 i 5M1 M3

5. Calculate the moment of inertia of the transformed cracked
section at the center

Referring to Fig. I9e and assuming tentatively that the neutral axis falls within the flange,
we see nAs = 10(3.16) = 31.6 in2 (203.88 cm2). The static moment with respect to the neu-
tral axis is Q = l/2(68y2) - 31.6(20.5 -y) = O; y = 3.92 in (99.568 mm). The neutral axis
therefore falls within the flange, as assumed. The moment of inertia with respect to the
neutral axis is I2 = 0/3)68(3.92)3 + 31.6(20.5 - 3.92)2 = 10,052 in4 (41.840 dm4).

Calculation Procedure:

1. Compute the value of c associated with balanced design

An interaction diagram, as the term is used here, is one in which every point on the curve
represents a set of simultaneous values of the ultimate moment and allowable ultimate ax-
ial load. Let €A and eB = strain of reinforcement at A and B, respectively; ec = strain of ex-
treme fiber of concrete; FA and FB = stress in reinforcement at A and B, respectively,
lb/in2 (kPa); FA and F8 = resultant force in reinforcement at A and 5, respectively; Fc =
resultant force in concrete, Ib (N).
Compression will be considered positive and tension negative. For simplicity, disre-
gard the slight reduction in concrete area caused by the steel at A.
Referring to Fig. 2OZ?, compute the value of c associated with balanced design. Com-
puting Pb and Mb yields cbld = 0.0037(0.003 +fy/Es) = 87,000/(87,0OO +£); Cb9 = 10.62 in

Ib (355,840 N); FB = 46,600 Ib (207,276.8 N); Pn = 0.70(550,800 + 80,000 + 46,600) =
474,200 Ib (2,109,241.6 N); Mu = 0.70(80,000 - 46,600)6.5 = 152,000 in-lb (17,192.9
N-m).

4. Compute the value of c at which Mu = O; compute P0

The bending moment vanishes when FB reaches 80,000 Ib (355,840 N). From the calcula-
tion in step 3,/6 = 87,000(c - d)/c = 40,000 lb/in2 (275,800 kPa); therefore, c = 28.7 in
(728.98 mm); P0 = 0.70(550,800 + 160,000) = 497,600 Ib (2,213,324.8 N).

5. Assign other values to c, and compute Pu and Mu

By assigning values to c ranging from 8 to 28.7 in (203. 2 to 728.98 mm), typical calcula-
tions are: when c = 8 in (203.2 mm), fB = -40,000 lb/in2 (-275,800 kPa); fA =
40,000(5.5/7.5) = 29,300 lb/in2 (202,023.5 kPa); a = 6.8 in (172.72 mm); F0 = 30,600(6.8)
= 208,100 Ib (925,628.8 N); P14 = 0.70(208,100 + 58,600 - 80,000) = 130,700 Ib
(581,353.6 N); Mn = 0.70 (208,100 x 5.6 + 138,600 x 6.5) = 1,446,000 in-lb (163,369.1
N-m).
When c = 10 in (254 mm), fA = 40,000 lb/in2 (275,800 kPa); fB = -40,000 lb/in2
(-275,800 kPa); a = 8.5 in (215.9 mm); F0 = 30,600(8.5) = 260,100 Ib (1,156,924.8 N); Pu
= 0.70(260,100) = 182,100 Ib (809,980 N); Mn = 0.70(260,100 x 4.75 + 160,000 x 6.5) =
1,593,000 in-lb (179,997.1 N-m).
When c = 14 in (355.6 mm)JB = 87,000(14 - 15.5)/14 = -9320 lb/in2(-64,261.4kPa);
a = 11.9 in (302.26 mm); F0 = 30,600(11.9) = 364,100 Ib (1,619,516.8 N); Pn =
0.70(364,100 + 80,000 - 18,600) = 297,900 Ib (1,325,059.2 N); Mn = 0.70(364,100 x
3.05 + 98,600 x 6.5) = 1,226,000 in-lb (138,513.5 N-m).

6. Plot the points representing computed values of P11 and Mu in
the interaction diagram

Figure 21 shows these points. Pass a smooth curve through these points. Note that when
Pn < Pb, a reduction in Mn is accompanied by a reduction in the allowable load Pn.

AXIAL-LOAD CAPACITY OF
RECTANGULAR MEMBER

The member analyzed in the previous calculation procedure is to carry an eccentric longi-
tudinal load. Determine the allowable ultimate load if the eccentricity as measured from TV
is (a) 9.2 in (233.68 mm); (b) 6 in (152.4 mm).

Calculation Procedure:

1. Evaluate the eccentricity associated with balanced design

Let e denote the eccentricity of the load and eb the eccentricity associated with balanced
design. Then Mn = Pne. In Fig. 21, draw an arbitrary radius vector OD; then tan 0 =
EDIOE = eccentricity corresponding to point D.
Proceeding along the interaction diagram from A to C, we see that the value of c in-
creases and the value of e decreases. Thus, c and e vary in the reverse manner. To evalu-
ate the allowable loads, it is necessary to identify the portion of the interaction diagram to
which each eccentricity applies.
From the computations of the previous calculation procedure, eb = M^JPb =

1,596,000/193,400 = 8.25 in (209.55 mm). This result discloses that an eccentricity of 9.2
in (233.68 mm) corresponds to a point on AB and an eccentricity of 6 in (152.4 mm) cor-
responds to a point on BC.

2. Evaluate Pu when e = 9.2 in (233.68 mm)

It was found that c = 9 in (228.6 mm) is a significant value. The corresponding value of e
is 1,577,000/163,900 = 9.62 in (244.348 mm). This result discloses that in the present in-
stance O 9 in (228.6 mm) and consequently fA =fy; FA = 80,000 Ib (355,840 N); FB =
-80,000 Ib (-355,840 N); Fc = 30,600«; Pw/0.70 = 30,60Oa; MM/0.70 = 30,600a(18 - a)/2
+ 160,000(6.5); e = MJP14 = 9.2 in (233.68 mm). Solving gives a = 8.05 in (204.47 mm),
P14 = 172,400 Ib (766,835.2 N).

3. Evaluate Pu when e = 6 in (152.4 mm)

To simplify this calculation, the ACI Code permits replacement of curve BC in the inter-
action diagram with a straight line through B and C. The equation of this line is

Pu = P0-(Po-Bd- 
Mb

M14

(39)

By replacing Mu with Pue, the following relation is obtained:

f"- i+(P .-W 
In the present instance, P0 = 497,600 Ib (2,213,324.8 N); pb = 193,400 Ib (860,243.2 N);
Mb = 1,596,000 in-lb (180,316.1 N-m). Thus Pu = 232,100 Ib (1,032,380 N).

(39fl)

ALLOWABLE ECCENTRICITY OF A MEMBER

The member analyzed in the previous two calculation procedures is to carry an ultimate
longitudinal load of 150 kips (667.2 kN) that is eccentric with respect to axis N. Deter-
mine the maximum eccentricity with which the load may be applied.

Calculation Procedure:

1. Express Pu in terms of c, and solve for c

From the preceding calculation procedures, it is seen that the value of c corresponding to
the maximum eccentricity lies between 8 and 9 in (203.2 and 228.6 mm), and therefore fA
<fy. Thus fB = -40,000 lb/in2 (-275,800 kPa); fA = 40,000(c - 2.5)7(15.5 - c); Fc =
30,600(0.85c) = 26,00Oc; 150,000 = 0.70{26,000c + 80,000[(c - 2.5)7(15.5 - c) - 1]}; c =
8.60 in (218.44 mm).

2. Compute Mu and evaluate the eccentricity

Thus, a = 7.31 in (185.674 mm); Fc = 223,700 Ib (995,017.6 N);/, = 35,360 lb/in2
(243,807.2 kPa); Mu = 0.70(223,700 x 5.35 + 150,700 x 6.5) = 1,523,000 in-lb (172,068.5
N-m); e = Mu/Pu = 10.15 in (257.81 mm).

Design of Compression Members
by Working-Stress Method

The notational system is as follows: Ag = gross area of section, in2 (cm2); A5 = area of ten-
sion reinforcement, in2 (cm2); Ast = total area of longitudinal reinforcement, in2 (cm2); D
= diameter of circular section, in (mm); pg = Ast/Ag; P = axial load on member, Ib (N);/ =
allowable stress in longitudinal reinforcement, lb/in2 (kPa); m =/,/(0.85//).
The working-stress method of designing a compression member is essentially an
adaptation of the ultimate-strength method. The allowable ultimate loads and bending
moments are reduced by applying an appropriate factor of safety, and certain simplifica-
tions in computing the ultimate values are introduced.
The allowable concentric load on a short spirally reinforced column is P = Ag(Q.25f +
fsPg

DESIGN OFA SPIRALLY
REINFORCED COLUMN

A short circular column, spirally reinforced, is to support a concentric load of 420 kips
(1868.16 kN). Design the member, using/; = 4000 lb/in2 (27,580 kPa) and./; = 50,000
lb/in2 (344,750 kPa).

Calculation Procedure:

1. Assume pg = O.O25 and compute the diameter of the section

Thus, 0.25/c' = 1000 lb/in2 (6895 kPa);/ = 20,000 lb/in2 (137,900 kPa). By Eq. 40, A8 =
420/(1 + 2 Ox 0.025) = 280 in2 (1806.6 cm2). Then D = (^0.785)05 = 18.9 in (130.32
mm). Se tD = 19 in (131.01 mm), making^ = 283 in2 (1825.9 cm2).

2. Select the reinforcing bars

The load carried by the concrete = 283 kips (1258.8 kN). The load carried by the steel =
420 - 283 = 137 kips (609.4 kN). Then the area of the steel is Ast, = 137/20 = 6.85 in2
(44.196 cm2). Use seven no. 9 bars, each having an area of 1 in2 (6.452 cm2). Then Ast, =
7.00 in2 (45.164 cm2). The Reinforced Concrete Handbook shows that a 19-in (482.6-
mm) column can accommodate 11 no. 9 bars in a single row.

3. Design the spiral reinforcement

The portion of the column section bounded by the outer circumference of the spiral is
termed the core of the section. Let^4c = core area, in2 (cm2); D0 = core diameter, in (mm);
0, = cross-sectional area of spiral wire, in2 (cm2); g = pitch of spiral, in (mm);/^ = ratio of
volume of spiral reinforcement to volume of core.
The ACI Code requires 1.5-in (38.1 -mm) insulation for the spiral, with g restricted to a
maximum of DJ6. Then Dc = 19 - 3 = 16 in (406.4 mm); Ac = 201 in2 (1296.9 cm2); DJ6
= 2.67 in (67.818 mm). Use a 2.5-in (63.5-mm) spiral pitch. Taking a 1-in (25.4-mm)

Use H-in (12.7-mm) diameter wire with as = 0.196 in2 (1.2646 cm2).

4. Summarize the design

Thus: column size: 19-in (482.6-mm) diameter; longitudinal reinforcement: seven no. 9
bars; spiral reinforcement: 1/2-in (12.7-mm) diameter wire, 2.5-in (63.5-mm) pitch.

ANALYSIS OFA RECTANGULAR MEMBER
BY INTERACTION DIAGRAM

A short tied member having the cross section shown in Fig. 22 is to resist an axial load
and a bending moment that induces rotation about axis N. The member is made of 4000-
lb/in2 (27,580-kPa) concrete, and the steel has a yield point of 50,000 lb/in2 (344,750
kPa). Construct the interaction diagram for this member.

Calculation Procedure:

1. Compute a and M

Consider a composite member of two materi-
als having equal strength in tension and com-
pression, the member being subjected to an
axial load P and bending moment M that in-
duce the allowable stress in one or both ma-
terials. Let P0 = allowable axial load in ab-
sence of bending moment, as computed by
dividing the allowable ultimate load by a fac-
tor of safety; Mf = allowable bending mo-

ment jn absence of axjai joad5 as computed

Equation 44 is represented by line AB in Fig. 23; it is also valid with respect to a rein-
forced-concrete member for a certain range of values of P and M. This equation is not ap-
plicable in the following instances: (a) If Mis relatively small, Eq. 44 yields a value of P
in excess of that given by Eq. 41. Therefore, the interaction diagram must contain line
CD, which represents the maximum value of P.
(b) If M is relatively large, the section will crack, and the equal-strength assumption
underlying Eq. 44 becomes untenable.
Let point E represent the set of values of P and M that will cause cracking in the ex-
treme concrete fiber. And let Pb = axial load represented by point E; Mb = bending mo-
ment represented by point

and the latter on an uncracked section. The subscript b as used by the ACI Code in the
present instance does not refer to balanced design. However, its use illustrates the analogy
with ultimate-strength analysis.) Let F denote the point representing M0.
For simplicity, the interaction diagram is assumed to be linear between E and F. The
interaction equation for a cracked section may therefore be expressed in any of the fol-
3wing forms:

(4?C)

where/?' = ratio of area of compression reinforcement to effective area of concrete. The
value ofPa is taken as

Pa = 034f;Ag(l+Pgm) 

(48)

The value of Mf is found by applying the section modulus of the transformed un-
cracked section, using a modular ratio of 2n to account for stress transfer between steel
and concrete engendered by plastic flow. (If the steel area is multiplied by 2n - 1, al-
lowance is made for the reduction of the concrete area.)
Computing Pa and Mf yields Ag = 260 in2 (1677.5 cm2); Ast = 7.62 in2 (49.164 cm2);
pg = 7.62/260 - 0.0293; m = 50/[0.85(4)] = 14.7; p/n = 0.431; n = 8; Pa = 0.34(4)(260)
(1.431) = 506 kips (2250.7 kN).
The section modulus to be applied in evaluating Mf is found thus: /= (1Xw)(13)(20)3 +
7.62(15)(7.5)2 = 15,100 in4 (62.85 dm4); S = Vc= 15,100/10 = 1510 in3 (24,748.9 cm3);
Mf= Sf0 = 1510(1.8) = 2720 in-kips (307.3 kN-m).

2. Compute Pb and Mb

By Eq. 476, M1JP13 = 17.5(0.67 * 0.431 + 0.17) = 8.03 in (203.962 mm). By Eq. 446, Pb =
PaMf/(Mj + 8.03PJ = 506 * 2720/(2720 + 8.03 x 506) = 203 kips (902.9 kN); Mb =
8.03(203) = 1630 in-kips (184.2 kN-m).

3. Compute M0

By Eq. 466, M0 = 0.40(3.81)(50)(15) = 1140 in-kips (128.8 kN-m).

4. Compute the limiting value of P

As established by Eq. 41, Pmax = 0.2125(4)(260) + 0.85(20)(7.62) = 351 kips (1561.2
kN).

5. Construct the interaction diagram

The complete diagram is shown in Fig. 23.

AXIAL-LOAD CAPACITY OF A
RECTANGULAR MEMBER

The member analyzed in the previous calculation procedure is to carry an eccentric longi-
tudinal load. Determine the allowable load if the eccentricity as measured from TV is (a) 10
in (254 mm); (b) 6 in (152.4 mm).

Calculation Procedure:

1. Evaluate P when e = IO in (254 mm)

As the preceding calculations show, the eccentricity corresponding to point E in the inter-
action diagram is 8.03 in (203.962 mm). Consequently, an eccentricity of 10 in (254 mm)
corresponds to a point on EF, and an eccentricity of 6 in (152.4 mm) corresponds to a
point on ED.
By Eq. 456, P = 203(1140)7(1140 -1630 + 203 x 10) = 150 kips (667.2 kN).

2. Evaluate P when e = 6 in (152.4 mm)

By Eq. 44Z>, P = 506(2720)7(2720 + 506 x 6) = 239 kips (1063.1 kN).

Design of Column Footings

A reinforced-concrete footing supporting a single column differs from the usual type of
flexural member in the following respects: It is subjected to bending in all directions, the
ratio of maximum vertical shear to maximum bending moment is very high, and it carries
a heavy load concentrated within a small area. The consequences are as follows: The foot-
ing requires two-way reinforcement, its depth is determined by shearing rather than bend-
ing stress, the punching-shear stress below the column is usually more critical than the
shearing stress that results from ordinary beam action, and the design of the reinforcement
is controlled by the bond stress as well as the bending stress.
Since the footing weight and soil pressure are collinear, the former does not contribute
to the vertical shear or bending mo-
ment. It is convenient to visualize the
footing as being subjected to an upward
load transmitted by the underlying soil
and a downward reaction supplied by
the column, this being, of course, an in-
version of the true form of loading. The
footing thus functions as an overhang-
ing beam. The effective depth of foot-
ing is taken as the distance from the top
surface to the center of the upper row of
bars, the two rows being made identical
to avoid confusion.
Refer to Fig. 24, which shows a
square footing supporting a square,
symmetrically located concrete column.
Let P = column load, kips (kN); p = net
soil pressure (that caused by the column 
load alone), lb/ft2 (kPa); A = area of
footing, ft2 (m2); L = side of footing, ft
(m); h = side of column, in (mm); d =
effective depth of footing, ft (m); t =
thickness of footing, ft (m);fb = bearing
stress at interface of column, lb/in2
(kPa); vi = nominal shearing stress un-
der column, lb/in2 (kPa); V2 = nominal 
shearing stress caused by beam action, 
lb/in2 (kPa); b0 = width of critical sec-

FIGURE 24

tion for V1, ft (m); F1 and V2 = vertical she'ar at critical section for stresses V1 and V2, re-
spectively.
In accordance with the ACI Code, the critical section for V1 is the surface GHJK, the
sides of which lie at a distance d/2 from the column faces. The critical section for V2 is
plane LM, located at a distance d from the face of the column. The critical section for
bending stress and bond stress is plane EF through the face of the column. In calculating
V2, f, and u, no allowance is made for the effects of the orthogonal reinforcement.

DESIGN OF AN ISOLATED
SQUARE FOOTING

A 20-in (508-mm) square tied column reinforced with eight no. 9 bars carries a concentric
load of 380 kips (1690.2 kN). Design a square footing by the working-stress method us-
ing these values: the allowable soil pressure is 7000 lb/ft2 (335.2 kPa);/c' = 3000 lb/in2
(20,685 kPa); andfs - 20,000 lb/in2 (137,900 kPa).

Calculation Procedure:

1. Record the allowable shear, bond, and bearing stresses

From the ACI Code table, V1 = 110 lb/in2 (758.5 kPa); V2 = 60 lb/in2 (413.7 kPa);/^ =
1125 lb/in2 (7756.9 kPa); u = 4.8(/c')°-5/bar diameter - 264/bar diameter.

2. Check the bearing pressure on the footing

ThusX - 380/[20(2O)] = 0.95 kips/in2 (7.258 MPa) < 1.125 kips/in2 (7.7568 MPa). This
is acceptable.

3. Establish the length of footing

For this purpose, assume the footing weight is 6 percent of the column load. Then A =
1.06(380)77 = 57.5 ft2 (5.34 in2). Make L = 1 ft 8 in - 7.67 ft (2.338 m); A = 58.8 ft2 (5.46
m2).

4. Determine the effective depth as controlled by V1

Apply

(4V1 + p)f + h(4v{ + 2p)d = p(A - h2) 

(49)

Verify the result after applying this equation. Thus p = 380/58.8 = 6.46 kips/ft2 (0.309
MPa); = 0.11(144) = 15.84 kips/ft2 (0.758 MPa); 69.Sc/2 + UlAd = 361.8; d =• 1.54 ft
(0.469 m). Checking in Fig. 24, we see GH = 1.67 + 1.54 = 3.21 ft (0.978 m); V1 =
6.46(58.8 - 3.212) = 313 kips (1392.2 kN); V1 = V1I(^d) = 313/[4(3.2I)(1.54)] = 15.83
kips/ft2 (0.758 MPa). This is acceptable.

5. Establish the thickness and true depth of footing

Compare the weight of the footing with the assumed weight. Allowing 3 in (76.2 mm) for
insulation and assuming the use of no. 8 bars, we see that t = d + 4.5 in (114.3 mm). Then
t = 1.54(12) + 4.5 = 23.0 in (584.2 mm). Make t = 24 in (609.6 mm); d = 19.5 in = 1.63 ft
(0.496 m). The footing weight = 58.8(2)(0.150) = 17.64 kips (1384.082 kN). The as-
sumed weight = 0.06(380) = 22.8 kips (101.41 kN). This is acceptable.

6. Check V2

In Fig. 24, AL = (7.67 - 1.67)72 - 1.63 = 1.37 ft (0.417 m); V2 = 380(1.37/7.67) =

67.9 kips (302.02 kN); V2 = V2I(Ld) = 67,900/[92(19.S)] = 38 lb/in2 (262.0 kPa) < 60
lb/in2 (413.7 kPa). This is acceptable.

7. Design the reinforcement

In Fig. 24, EA = 3.00 ft (0.914 m); VEF= 380(3.00/7.67) = 148.6 kips (666.97 kN); MEF =
148.6(1/2)(3.00)(12) = 2675 in-kips (302.22 kN-m); A5 = 2675/[20(0.874)(19.5)] = 7.85 in2
(50.648 cm2). Try 10 no. 8 bars each way. Then A3 = 7.90 in2 (50.971 cm2); ^o = 31.4 in
(797.56 mm); u = VEFTZojd = 148,600/[31.4(0.874)(19.5)] = 278 lb/in2 (1916.81 kPa);
"allow = 264/1 = 264 lb/in2 (1820.3 kPa).
The bond stress at EF is slightly excessive. However, the ACI Code, in sections based
on ultimate-strength considerations, permits disregarding the local bond stress if the aver-
age bond stress across the length of embedment is less than 80 percent of the allowable
stress. Let Le denote this length. Then Le = EA - 3 = 33 in (838.2 mm); 0.80wallow = 211
lb/in2 (1454.8 kPa); uav = Asfsl(L£o) = 0.79(20,000)/[33(3.1)] = 154 lb/in2 (1061.8 kPa).
This is acceptable.

8. Design the dowels to comply with the Code

The function of the dowels is to transfer the compressive force in the column reinforcing
bars to the footing. Since this is a tied column, assume the stress in the bars is
0.85(20,000) = 17,000 lb/in2 (117,215.0 kPa). Try eight no. 9 dowels withfy = 40,000
lb/in2 (275,800.0 kPa). Then u = 2647(9/8) -
235 lb/in2 (1620.3 kPa); Le = 1.00(17,00O)/
[235(3.5)] = 20.7 in (525.78 mm). Since the
footing can provide a 21-in (533.4-mm) em-
bedment length, the dowel selection is satis-
factory. Also, the length of lap = 20(9/8) =
22.5 in (571.5 mm); length of dowels = 20.7
+ 22.5 = 43.2, say 44 in (1117.6 mm). The
footing is shown in Fig. 25.

COMBINED FOOTING DESIGN

An 18-in (457.2-mm) square exterior column
and a 20-in (508.0-mm) square interior col-
umn carry loads of 250 kips (1112 kN) and
370 kips (1645.8 kN), respectively. The col-
umn centers are 16 ft (4.9 m) apart, and the
footing cannot project beyond the face of the
exterior column. Design a combined rectan-
gular footing by the working-stress method,
using fi = 3000 lb/in2 (20,685.0 kPa), /, =
20,000 lb/in2 (137,900.0 kPa), and an allow- 
able soil pressure of 5000 lb/in2 (239.4 kPa).

1. Establish the length of footing, applying the criterion
of uniform soil pressure under total live and dead loads

cause the required footing would project beyond the property limits. It then becomes nec-
essary to use a combined footing that supports the exterior column and the adjacent interi-
or column, the footing being so proportioned that the soil pressure is approximately uni-
form.
The footing dimensions are shown in Fig. 26a, and the reinforcement is seen in Fig.
27. It is convenient to visualize the combined footing as being subjected to an upward
load transmitted by the underlying soil and reactions supplied by the columns. The mem-

FIGURE 27

her thus functions as a beam that overhangs one support. However, since the footing is
considerably wider than the columns, there is a transverse bending as well as longitudinal
bending in the vicinity of the columns. For simplicity, assume that the transverse bending
is confined to the regions bounded by planes AB and EF and by planes GH and NP, the
distance m being h/2 or d/2, whichever is smaller.
In Fig. 260, let Z denote the location of the resultant of the column loads. Then x =
370(16)7(250 + 370) - 9.55 ft (2.910 m). Since Z is to be the centroid of the footing, L =
2(0.75 + 9.55) = 20.60 ft (6.278 m). Set L = 20 ft 8 in (6.299 m), but use the value 20.60 ft
(6.278 m) in the stress calculations.

2. Construct the shear and bending-moment diagrams

The net soil pressure per foot of length = 620/20.60 = 30.1 kips/lin ft (439.28 kN/m).
Construct the diagrams as shown in Fig. 26.

3. Establish the footing thickness

Use

(Pv2 + OMVL + Pp')d-Q.Pd2- VLp' 

(50)

where P = aggregate column load, kips (kN); V = maximum vertical shear at a column
face, kips (kN);/?' = gross soil pressure, kips/ft2 (MPa).
Assume that the longitudinal steel is centered 3 /4 in (88.9 mm) from the face of the
footing. Then P = 620 kips (2757.8 kN); V= 229.2 kips (1019.48 kN); V2 = 0.06(144) =
8.64 kips/ft2 (0.414 MPa); 926Od- 105Ad2 = 23,608; d = 2.63 ft (0.801 m); t = 2.63 +
0.29 = 2.92 ft. Set t = 2 ft 11 in (0.889 m); d = 2 ft 71X2 in (0.800 m).

4. Compute the vertical shear at distance d from the column face

Establish the width of the footing. Thus V= 229.2 - 2.63(30.1) - 150.0 kips (667.2 kN);
v = VI(Wd), or W= VI(Vd) = 150/[8.64(2.63)] - 6.60 ft (2.012 m). Set W= 6 ft 8 in
(2.032 m).

5. Check the soil pressure

The footing weight - 20.67(6.67)(2.92)(0.150) = 60.4 kips (268.66 kN); p' = (620 +
60.4)/[(20.67)(6.67)] - 4.94 kips/ft2 (0.236 MPa) < 5 kips/ft2 (0.239 MPa). This is accept-
able.

6. Check the punching shear

Thus,/? = 4.94 - 2.92(0.150) = 4.50 kips/ft2 (0.215 MPa). At Cl: b0 = 18 + 31.5 + 2 (18 +
15.8) = 117 in (2971.8 mm); V= 250 - 4.50(49.5)(33.8)/144 = 198 kips (880.7 kN); V1 =
198,000/[117(31.5)] = 54 lb/in2 (372.3 kPa) < 110 lb/in2 (758.5 kPa); this is acceptable.
At C2: b0 = 4(20 + 31.5) - 206 in (5232.4 mm); V= 370 - 4.50(51.5)2/144 = 287 kips
(1276.6 kN); V1 = 287,000/[206(31.5)] = 44 lb/in2 (303.4 kPa). This is acceptable.

7. Design the longitudinal reinforcement for negative moment

Thus, M= 851,400 ft-lb = 10,217,000 in-lb (1,154,316.6 N -m ) ;'Mb = 223(80)(31.5)2 =
17,700,000 in-lb (1,999,746.0 N-m). Therefore, the steel is stressed to capacity, and As =
10,217,000/[20,000(0.874)(31.5)] - 18.6 in2 (120.01 cm2). Try 15 no. 10 bars with A3 =
19.1 in2 (123.2 cm2); Zo = 59.9 in (1521.46 mm).
The bond stress is maximum at the point of contraflexure, where V= 15.81(30.1) -
250 = 225.9 kips (1004.80 kN); u = 225,900/[59.9(0.874)(31.5)] = 137 lb/in2 (944.6 kPa);
"allow = 3.4(3000) °5/l.25 = 149 lb/in2 (1027.4 kPa). This is acceptable.

8. Design the longitudinal reinforcement for positive moment

For simplicity, design for the maximum moment rather than the moment at the face of the
column. Then A5 = 158,400(12)/[20,000(0.874)(31.5)] = 3.45 in2 (22.259 cm2). Try six
no. 7 bars with As = 3.60 in2 (23.227 cm2); So = 16.5 in (419.10 mm). Take LM as the
critical section for bond, and u = 90,800/[16.5(0.874)(31.5)] = 200 lb/in2 (1379.0 kPa);
"allow = 4.8(3000)°-5/0.875 - 302 lb/in2 (2082.3 kPa). This is acceptable.

9. Design the transverse reinforcement under the interior column

For this purpose, consider member GNPH as an independent isolated footing. Then VST =
370(2.50/6.67) = 138.8 kips (617.38 kN); MST = 1/2(138.8)(2.50)(12) = 2082 hvkips
(235.22 kN-m). Assume d = 35 - 4.5 = 30.5 in (774.7 mm); A8 = 2,082,000/
[20,000(0.874)(30.5)] = 3.91 in2 (25.227 cm2). Try seven no. 7 bars; A5 = 4.20 in2
(270.098 cm2); Zo = 19.2 in (487.68 mm); u = 138,800/[19.2(0.874)(30.5)] = 271 lb/in2
(1868.5 kPa); t/allow = 302 lb/in2 (2082.3 kPa). This is acceptable.
Since the critical section for shear falls outside the footing, shearing stress is not a cri-
terion in this design.

10. Design the transverse reinforcement under the exterior
column; disregard eccentricity

Thus, Vuv = 250(2.58/6.67) = 96.8 kips (430.57 kN); M1Jv= 1/2(96.8)(2.58)(12) = 1498
in-kips (169.3 kN-m); As = 2.72 in2 (17.549 cm2). Try five no. 7 bars; A5 = 3.00 in2
(19.356 cm2); ^o - 13.7 in (347.98 mm); u = 96,800/[13.7 (0.874)(31.5)] - 257 lb/in2
(1772.0 kPa). This is acceptable.

Cantilever Retaining Walls

Retaining walls having a height ranging from 10 to 20 ft (3.0 to 6.1 m) are generally built
as reinforced-concrete cantilever members. As shown in Fig. 28, a cantilever wall com-

prises a vertical stem to retain the soil, a
horizontal base to support the stem, and in
many instances a key that projects into the
underlying soil to augment the resistance to
sliding. Adequate drainage is an essential
requirement, because the accumulation of
water or ice behind the wall would greatly
increase the horizontal thrust.
The calculation of earth thrust in this
section is based on Rankine's theory, which
is developed in a later calculation proce-
dure. When a live load, termed a surcharge,
is applied to the retained soil, it is conven-
ient to replace this load with a hypothetical
equivalent prism of earth. Referring to Fig.
28, consider a portion QR of the wall, R be-
ing at distance y below the top. Take the
length of wall normal to the plane of the
drawing as 1 ft (0.3 m). Let T = resultant
earth thrust on QR; M = moment of this
thrust with respect to R; h = height of 
equivalent earth prism that replaces sur-
charge; H> = unit weight of earth; Ca = coef-
ficient of active earth pressure; Cp = coeffi-
cient of passive earth pressure. Then

DESIGN OFA CANTILEVER
RETAINING WALL

Applying the working-stress method, design a reinforced-concrete wall to retain an earth
bank 14 ft (4.3 m) high. The top surface is horizontal and supports a surcharge of 500
lb/ft2 (23.9 kPa). The soil weighs 130 lb/ft3 (20.42 kN/m3), and its angle of internal fric-
tion is 35°; the coefficient of friction of soil and concrete is 0.5. The allowable soil pres-
sure is 4000 lb/ft2 (191.5 kPa);/c' = 3000 lb/in2 (20,685 kPa) and fy = 40,000 lb/in2
(275,800 kPa). The base of the structure must be set 4 ft (1.2 m) below ground level to
clear the frost line.

Calculation Procedure:

1. Secure a trial section of the wall

Apply these relations: a = 0.60//; 6 < 8 in (203.2 mm); c = d=b + 0.045/z;/= a/3 - c/2.
The trial section is shown in Fig. 29a, and the reinforcement is shown in Fig. 30. As
the calculation will show, it is necessary to provide a key to develop the required resist-

ance to sliding. The sides of the key are sloped to ensure that the surrounding soil will re-
main undisturbed during excavation.

2. Analyze the trial section for stability

The requirements are that there be a factor of safety (FS) against sliding and overturning
of at least 1.5 and that the soil pressure have a value lying between O and 4000 Ib/ft2 (O
and 191.5 kPa). Using the equation developed later in this handbook gives h = sur-
charge/soil weight = 500/130 - 3.85 ft (1.173 m); sin 35° = 0.574; tan 35° = 0.700; Ca =
0.271; Cp = 3.69; Caw = 35.2 lb/ft3 (5.53 kN/m3); Cpw = 480 lb/ft3 (75.40 kN/m3); TAB =
1/2(35.2)18(18 + 2 x 3.85) = 8140 Ib (36,206.7 N); MAB = (V6)35.2(18)2(18 + 3 x 3.85) =
56,200 ft Ib (76,207.2 N-m).
The critical condition with respect to stability is that in which the surcharge extends to
G. The moments of the stabilizing forces with respect to the toe are computed in Table 2.
In Fig. 29c, x = 81,030/21,180 = 3.83 ft (1.167 m); e = 5.50 - 3.83 = 1.67 ft (0.509 m).
The fact that the resultant strikes the base within the middle third attests to the absence of
uplift. By /= (PIA)(I ± 6CxIdx ± 6eyldy\pa = (21,180/1I)(I + 6 x 1.67/11) = 3680 lb/ft2
(176.2 kPa); pb = (21,180/1I)(I - 6 x 1.67/11) - 171 lb/ft2 (8.2 kPa). Check: x =
(11/3)(3680 + 2 x 171)7(3680 + 171) = 3.83 ft (1.167 m), as before. Also,/?c = 2723 lb/ft2
(130.4 kPa); pd = 2244 lb/ft2 (107.4 kPa); FS against overturning = 137,230/56,200 =
2.44. This is acceptable.
Lateral displacement of the wall produces sliding of earth on earth to the left of C and
of concrete on earth to the right of C. In calculating the passive pressure, the layer of earth
lying above the base is disregarded, since its effectiveness is unknown. The resistance to
sliding is as follows: friction, A to C (Fig. 29): ^(368O + 2723)(3)(0.700) = 6720 Ib
(29,890.6 N); friction, C to B: '/2(2723 + 171)(8)(0.5) = 5790 Ib (25,753.9 N); passive
earth pressure: '/2(480^2.7S)2 = 1820 Ib (8095.4 N). The total resistance to sliding is the
sum of these three items, or 14,330 Ib (63,739.8 N). Thus, the FS against sliding is
14,330/8140 = 1.76. This is acceptable because it exceeds 1.5. Hence the trial section is
adequate with respect to stability.

3. Calculate the soil pressures when the surcharge extends to H

Thus W3 = 500(6.5) = 3250 Ib (14,456 N); ^W = 21,180 + 3250 = 24,430 Ib (108,664.6
N); M0 = 81,030 + 3250(7.75) = 106,220 ft-lb (144,034.3 N-m); x = 106,220/24,430 =
4.35 ft (1.326 m); e = 1.15 ft (0.351 m);pa = 3613 lb/ft2 (173 kPa);/?^ = 828 lb/ft2 (39.6
kPa); pc = 2853 lb/ft2 (136.6 kPa); pd = 2474 lb/ft2 (118.5 kPa).

4. Design the stem

At the base of the stem, y = 16.5 ft (5.03 m) and d = 18 - 3.5 = 14.5 in (368.30 mm);
TEF = 7030 Ib (31,269.4 N); MEF= 538,000 in-lb (60,783.24 N-m). The allowable shear at
a distance d above the base is Fallow = vbd = 60(12)(14.5) = 10,440 Ib (46,437.1 N). This
is acceptable. Also, Mb = 223(12)(14.5)2 = 563,000 in-lb (63,607.74 N-m); therefore, the
steel is stressed to capacity, and As = 538,000/[20,000(0.874)(14.5)] - 2.12 in2 (13.678
cm2). Use no. 9 bars 51X2 in (139.70 mm) on centers. Thus, A8 = 2.18 in2 (14.065 cm2);
So = 7.7 in (195.58/mm); u = 7030/[7.7(0.874)(14.5)] = 72 lb/in2 (496.5 kPa); wallow =
235 lb/in2 (1620.3 kPa). This is acceptable.
Alternate bars will be discontinued at the point where they become superfluous. As the

following calculations demonstrate, the theoretical cutoff point lies at y = 11 ft 7 in (3.531
m), where M = 218,400 in-lb (24,674.8 N-m); d = 4.5 + 10(11.58/16.5) = 11.52 in
(292.608 mm); As = 218,400/[20,0OO (0.874)(11.52)] = 1.08 in2 (6.968 cm2). This is ac-
ceptable. Also, T= 3930 Ib (17,480.6 N); u = 101 lb/in2 (696.4 kPa). This is acceptable.
From the ACI Code, anchorage - 12(9/8) - 13.5 in (342.9 mm).
The alternate bars will therefore be terminated at 6 ft 1 in (1.854 m) above the top of
the base. The Code requires that special precautions be taken where more than half the
bars are spliced at a point of maximum stress. To circumvent this requirement, the short
bars can be extended into the footing; therefore only the long bars require splicing.
For the dowels, wallow - 0.75(235) = 176 lb/in2 (1213.5 kPa); length of lap = 1.00
(20,000)/[176(3.5)] = 33 in (838.2 mm).

5. Design the heel

Let V and M denote the shear and bending moment, respectively, at section D. Case 1:
surcharge extending to G—downward pressure;? = 16,5(130) + 1.5(150) = 2370 lb/ft2
(113.5 kPa); V= 6.5[2370 - »/2(2244 + 171)] = 7560 Ib (33,626.9 N); M= 12(6 5)2 [V2 x
2370 - %(2244 + 2 x Hl)] = 383,000 in-lb (43,271.3 N-m).

Case 2: surcharge extending to H—p = 2370 + 500 = 2870 lb/ft2 (137.4 kPa); V =
6.5[2870 - !/2(2474 + 828)] = 7920 Ib (35,228.1 N) < Fallow; M= 12(6.5)2 [!/2 x 2870 -
%(2474 + 2 x 828)] = 379,000 in-lb (42,819.4 N-m); A3 = 2.12(383/538) =1 .51 in2 (9.742
cm2).
To maintain uniform bar spacing throughout the member, use no. 8 bars 5l/2 in (139.7
mm) on centers. In the heel, tension occurs at the top of the slab, and A5 = 1.72 in2 (11.097
cm2); ^o = 6.9 in (175.26 mm); u = 91 lb/in2 (627.4 kPa); wallow = 186 lb/in2 (1282.5 kPa).
This is acceptable.

6. Design the toe

For this purpose, assume the absence of backfill on the toe, but disregard the minor modi-
fication in the soil pressure that results. Let V and M denote the shear and bending mo-
ment, respectively, at section C (Fig. 29). The downward pressure/? = 1.5(150) = 225
lb/ft2 (10.8 kPa).
Case 1: surcharge extending to G (Fig. 29)— V= 3[^(368O + 2723) - 225] = 8930 Ib
(39,720.6 N); M = 12(3)2[(V6)(2723 + 2 x 3680) - ^(225)] = 169,300 in-lb (19,127.5
N-m).
Case 2: surcharge extending to //(Fig. 29)— V= 9020 Ib (40,121.0 N) < Kallow; M =
169,300 in-lb (19,127.5 N-m); A5 = 2.12(169,300/538,000) = 0.67 in2 (4.323 cm2). Use
no. 5 bars 5V2 in (139.7 mm) on centers. Then As = 0.68 in2 (4.387 cm2); ^o = 4.3 in
(109.22 mm); u = 166 lb/in2 (1144.4 kPa); wallow - 422 lb/in2 (2909.7 kPa). This is accept-
able.
The stresses in the key are not amenable to precise evaluation. Reinforcement is
achieved by extending the dowels and short bars into the key and bending them.
In addition to the foregoing reinforcement, no. 4 bars are supplied to act as tempera-
ture reinforcement and spacers for the main bars, as shown in Fig. 30.

PART 2

PRESTRESSED CONCRETE

Prestressed-concrete construction is designed to enhance the suitability of concrete as a
structural material by inducing prestresses opposite in character to the stresses resulting
from gravity loads. These prestresses are created by the use of steel wires or strands,
called tendons, that are incorporated in the member and subjected to externally applied
tensile forces. This prestressing of the steel may be performed either before or after pour-
ing of the concrete. Thus, two methods of prestressing a concrete beam are available: pre-
tensioning and posttensioning.
In pretensioning, the tendons are prestressed to the required amount by means of hy-
draulic jacks, their ends are tied to fixed abutments, and the concrete is poured around the
tendons. When hardening of the concrete has advanced to the required state, the tendons
are released. The tendons now tend to contract longitudinally to their original length and
to expand laterally to their original diameter, both these tendencies being opposed by the
surrounding concrete. As a result of the longitudinal restraint, the concrete exerts a tensile
force on the steel and the steel exerts a compressive force on the concrete. As a result of

the lateral restraint, the tendons are deformed to a wedge shape across a relatively short
distance at each end of the member. It is within this distance, termed the transmission
length, that the steel becomes bonded to the concrete and the two materials exert their pre-
stressing forces on each other. However, unless greater precision is warranted, it is as-
sumed for simplicity that the prestressing forces act at the end sections.
The tendons may be placed either in a straight line or in a series of straight-line seg-
ments, being deflected at designated points by means of holding devices. In the latter
case, prestressing forces between steel and concrete occur both at the ends and at these
deflection points.
In posttensioning, the procedure usually consists of encasing the tendons in metal or
rubber hoses, placing these in the forms, and then pouring the concrete. When the con-
crete has hardened, the tendons are tensioned and anchored to the ends of the concrete
beam by means of devices called end anchorages. If the hoses are to remain in the mem-
ber, the void within the hose is filled with grout. Posttensioning has two important advan-
tages compared with pretensioning: It may be performed at the job site, and it permits the
use of parabolic tendons.
The term at transfer refers to the instant at which the prestressing forces between steel
and concrete are developed. (In posttensioning, where the tendons are anchored to the
concrete one at a time, in reality these forces are developed in steps.) Assume for simplic-
ity that the tendons are straight and that the resultant prestressing force in these tendons
lies below the centroidal axis of the concrete section. At transfer, the member cambers
(deflects upward), remaining in contact with the casting bed only at the ends. Thus, the
concrete beam is compelled to resist the prestressing force and to support its own weight
simultaneously.
At transfer, the prestressing force in the steel diminishes because the concrete con-
tracts under the imposed load. The prestressing force continues to diminish as time elaps-
es as a result of the relaxation of the steel and the shrinkage and plastic flow of the con-
crete subsequent to transfer. To be effective, prestressed-concrete construction therefore
requires the use of high-tensile steel in order that the reduction in prestressing force may
be small in relation to the initial force. In all instances, we assume that the ratio of final to
initial prestressing force is 0.85. Moreover, to simplify the stress calculations, we also as-
sume that the full initial prestressing force exists at transfer and that the entire reduction
in this force occurs during some finite interval following transfer.
Therefore, two loading states must be considered in the design: the initial state, in
which the concrete sustains the initial prestressing force and the beam weight; and the fi-
nal state, in which the concrete sustains the final prestressing force, the beam weight, and
all superimposed loads. Consequently, the design of a prestressed-concrete beam differs
from that of a conventional type in that designers must consider two stresses at each
point, the initial stress and the final stress, and these must fall between the allowable com-
pressive and tensile stresses. A beam is said to be in balanced design if the critical initial
and final stresses coincide precisely with the allowable stresses.
The term prestress designates the stress induced by the initial prestressing force. The
terms prestress shear and prestress moment refer to the vertical shear and bending mo-
ment, respectively, that the initial prestressing force induces in the concrete at a given
section.
The eccentricity of the prestressing force is the distance from the action line of this re-
sultant force to the centroidal axis of the section. Assume that the tendons are subjected to
a uniform prestress. The locus of the centroid of the steel area is termed the trajectory of
the steel or of the prestressing force.
The sign convention is as follows: The eccentricity is positive if the action line of the
prestressing force lies below the centroidal axis. The trajectory has a positive slope if it

inclines downward to the right. A load is positive if it acts downward. The vertical shear
at a given section is positive if the portion of the beam to the left of this section exerts an
upward force on the concrete. A bending moment is positive if it induces compression
above the centroidal axis and tension below it. A compressive stress is positive; a tensile
stress, negative.
The notational system is as follows. Cross-sectional properties: A = gross area of sec-
tion, in2 (cm2) As = area of prestressing steel, in2 (cm2); d - effective depth of section at
ultimate strength, in (mm); h = total depth of section, in (mm); / = moment of inertia of
gross area, in4 (cm4); yb = distance from centroidal axis to bottom fiber, in (mm); Sb = sec-
tion modulus with respect to bottom fiber = I/yb, in3 (cm3); kb = distance from centroidal
axis to lower kern point, in (mm); kt = distance from centroidal axis to upper kern point,
in (mm). Forces and moments: F1 = initial prestressing force, Ib (N); Ff = final prestress-
ing force, Ib (N); 17 = FflFt

is in equilibrium, the left portion also induces compressive stresses on the concrete at C,
these stresses having a resultant that is numerically equal to and collinear with F1.

2. Express the prestress shear and moment in terms of F1-

Using the sign convention described, express the prestress shear and moment in terms
of Ff and Q. (The latter is positive if the slope of the trajectory is positive.) Thus Vp =
-F1 sin 8; Mp = -Ffe cos 0.

3. Compute the prestress shear and moment

Since 9 is minuscule, apply these approximations: sin 9 = tan 0, and cos 0=1. Then

K, =-F1-tan 0 

Or, Vp = -300,000(0.014) = -4200 Ib (-18,681.6 N).
Also,

Mp = -Fte 

Or, Mp = -300,000(8) = -2,400,000 in-lb (-271,152 Nm).

STRESSES IN A BEAM WITH
STRAIGHT TENDONS

A 12 x 18 in (304.8 x 457.2 mm) rectangular beam is subjected to an initial prestressing
force of 230 kips (1023.0 kN) applied 3.3 in (83.82 mm) below the center. The beam is on
a simple span of 30 ft (9.1 m) and carries a superimposed load of 840 Ib/lin ft (12,258.9
N/m). Determine the initial and final stresses at the supports and at midspan. Construct di-
agrams to represent the initial and final stresses along the span.

Calculation Procedures:

1. Compute the beam properties

Thus, A = 12(18) = 216 in2 (1393.6 cm2); Sb = St = (Y6)(^)(IS)2 = 648 in3 (10,620.7 cm3);
ww = (216/144)(150) = 225 Ib/lin ft (3,283.6 N/m).

2. Calculate the prestress in the top and bottom fibers

Since the section is rectangular, apply fbp = (FJA)(I + 6elh) = (230,000/216)(1 + 6 x
3.3/18) = + 2236 IMn2 (+15,417.2 kPa);^ = (FJA)(I - 6e/h) = -106 lb/in2 (-730.9 kPa).
For convenience, record the stresses in Table 3 as they are obtained.

3. Determine the stresses at midspan due to gravity loads

Thus M5 = (%)(840)(30)2(12) = 1,134,000 in-lb (128,119.32 N-m);/^ = -1,134,000/648 =
-1750 lb/in2 (-12,066.3 kPa);/, = + 1750 lb/in2 (12,066.3 kPa). By proportion,/^ =
-1750(225/840) = -469;/^ = +469 lb/in2 (+ 3233.8 kPa).

4. Compute the initial and final stresses at the supports

Thus,/w = + 2236 lb/in2 (+15,417.2 kPa);/,, = -106 lb/in2 (-730.9 kPa);^7= 0.85(2236) =
+ 1901 lb/in2 (+13,107.4 kPa);^-= 0.85(-106) = -90 lb/in2 (-620.6 kPa).

5. Determine the initial and final stresses at midspan

Thusfbi = + 2236 - 469 = + 1767 lb/in2 (+12,183.5 kPa);/tf = -106 + 469 = +363 lb/in2
(+2502.9 kPa);/^= + 1901 - 469 - 1750 = -318 lb/in2 (-2192.6 kPa);/^-= -90 + 469 +
1750 = +2129 lb/in2 (+14,679.5 kPa).

6. Construct the initial-stress diagram

In Fig. 320, construct the initial-stress diagram AfA^C at the support and the initial-stress
diagram MtM^f)E at midspan. Draw the parabolic arcs BD and CE. The stress diagram at
an intermediate section Q is obtained by passing a plane normal to the longitudinal axis.

This procedure illustrates the following principles relevant to a beam with straight ten-
dons carrying a uniform load: At transfer, the critical stresses occur at the supports; under
full design load, the critical stresses occur at midspan if the allowable final stresses ex-
ceed j] times the allowable initial stresses in absolute value.
The primary objective in prestressed-concrete design is to maximize the capacity of a
given beam by maximizing the absolute values of the prestresses at the section having the
greatest superimposed-load stresses. The three procedures that follow, when taken as a
unit, illustrate the manner in which the allowable prestresses may be increased numerical-
ly by taking advantage of the beam-weight stresses, which are opposite in character to the
prestresses. The next procedure will also demonstrate that when a beam is not in balanced
design, there is a range of values of F1 that will enable the member to carry this maximum
allowable load. In summary, the objective is to maximize the capacity of a given beam
and to provide the minimum prestressing force associated with this capacity.

DETERMINATION OF CAPACITY
AND PRESTRESSING FORCE FOR A BEAM
WITH STRAIGHT TENDONS

An 8 x 10 in (203.2 x 254 mm) rectangular beam, simply supported on a 20-ft (6.1-m)
span, is to be prestressed by means of straight tendons. The allowable stresses are: initial,
+ 2400 and - 190 lb/in2 (+16,548 and -1310.1 kPa); final + 2250 and -425 lb/in2
(+15,513.8 and - 2930.3 kPa). Evaluate the allowable unit superimposed load, the maxi-
mum and minimum prestressing force associated with this load, and the corresponding
eccentricities.

Calculation Procedure:

1. Compute the beam properties

Here A = 80 in2 (516.16 cm2); S= 133 in2 (858.1 cm2); ww = 83 Ib/lin ft (1211.3 N/m).

2. Compute the stresses at midspan due to the beam weight

Thus, Mw = (1/8)(83)(20)2(12) = 49,800 in-lb (5626.4 N-m); fbw = -49,800/133 = -374
lb/in2 (-2578.7 kPa),/^ = +374 lb/in2 (2578.7 kPa).

3. Set the critical stresses equal to their allowable values to
secure the allowable unit superimposed load

Use Fig. 32 or 33 as a guide. At support:^ = +2400 lb/in2 (+16,548 kPa);/ft- = -190 lb/in2
(-1310.1 kPa); at midspan, fbf = 0.85(2400) - 374 + fbs = -425 lb/in2 (-2930.4 kPa);
ftf = 0.85(-19O) + 374 + fts = +2250 lb/in2 (+15,513.8 kPa). Also,/fe = -2091 lb/in2
(-14,417.4 kPa);/ft = +2038 lb/in2 (+14,052 kPa).
Since the superimposed-load stresses at top and bottom will be numerically equal, the
latter value governs the beam capacity. Or ws = w^fjf^ = 83(2038/374) = 452 Ib/lin ft
(6596.4 N/m).

4. Find Firmax and its eccentricity

The value of ws was found by setting the critical value Of^1 and offtf equal to their re-
spective allowable values. However, since Sb is excessive for the load ws, there is flexibil-
ity with respect to the stresses at the bottom. The designer may set the critical value of ei-
ther fbi or fbf equal to its allowable value or produce some intermediate condition. As
shown by the calculations in step 3,^may vary within a range of 2091 - 2038 = 53 lb/in2
(365.4 kPa). Refer to Fig. 34, where the lines represent the stresses indicated.
Points B and F are fixed, but points A and E may be placed anywhere within the 53-
lb/in2 (365.4-kPa) range. To maximize F1-, place A at its limiting position to the right; i.e.,
set the critical value o ffbi rather than that o ffbf equal to the allowable value. Thenj£fl/ =
FimJA = Y2(TAQQ - 190) = + 1105 lb/in2 (+7619.0 kPa); F/max = 1105(80) = 88,400 Ib
(393,203.2 N);/^ = 1105 + 88,400e/133 = + 2400; e=l.95 in (49.53 mm).

5. Find Fifmin and its eccentricity

For this purpose, place A at its limiting position to the left. Then/^ = 2,400 - (53/0.85) =
+2338 lb/in2 (+ 16,120.5 kPa);/cfl/ = + 1074 lb/in2 (+7405.2 kPa); F,min = 85,920 Ib
(382,172.2 N); e = 1.96 in (49.78 mm).

6. Verify the value of F1- max by checking the critical stresses

At support: fbi = + 2400 lb/in2 (+16,548.0 kPa); fti = -190 lb/in2 (-1310.1 kPa). At
midspan:/^ = +2040 - 374 - 2038 = -372 lb/in2 (-2564.9 kPa);/^= -162 + 374 + 2038
= +2250 lb/in2 (+15,513.8 kPa).

FIGURE 34. Stresses at midspan under maximum prestressing force.

7. Verify the value of F1 min by checking the critical stresses

At support:/^- - + 2338 lb/in2 (16,120.5 kPa);^ =-190 lb/in2 (-1310.1 kPa). At midspan:
fbf = 0.85(2338) - 374 - 2038 = -425 lb/in2 (-2930.4 kPa);/^= +2250 lb/in2 (+15,513.8
kPa).

BEAM WITH DEFLECTED TENDONS

The beam in the previous calculation procedure is to be prestressed by means of tendons
that are deflected at the quarter points of the span, as shown in Fig. 35<z. Evaluate the al-
lowable unit superimposed load, the magnitude of the prestressing force, the eccentricity
C1 in the center interval, and the maximum and minimum allowable values of the eccen-
tricity e2 at the supports. What increase in capacity has been obtained by deflecting the
tendons?

FIGURE 35

Calculation Procedure:

1. Compute the beam-weight stresses at B

In the composite stress diagram, Fig. 35Z?, the difference between an ordinate to EF(j and
the corresponding ordinate to AHJ represents the value of/- at the given section. It is ap-
parent that if AE does not exceed HF9 then fti does not exceed HE in absolute value any-
where along the span. Therefore, for the center interval BC, the critical stresses at transfer
occur at the boundary sections B and C. Analogous observations apply to Fig. 35c.
Computing the beam-weight stresses at B yields fbw = (%)(-374) = -281 lb/in2
(-1937.5 kPa);/^ = +281 lb/in2 (+1937.5 kPa).

2. Tentatively set the critical stresses equal to their allowable
values to secure the allowable unit superimposed load

Thus, at B:fbi =fbp - 281 = +2400;/« =ftp + 281 = -190;/p = +2681 lb/in2 (+18,485.5
kPa);/p = -471 lb/in2 (-3247.5 kPa).
At M:fbf= 0.85(2681) -374 +/* - -425;/,- 0.85(-471) + 374 +/* = +2250;/,, =
-2330 lb/in2 (-16,065.4 kPa);/, = +2277 lb/in2 (+ 15,699.9 kPa). The latter value con-
trols.
Also, ws = 83(2277/374) - 505 Ib/lin ft (7369.9 N/m); 505/452 =1.12. The capacity is
increased 12 percent.
When the foregoing calculations are compared with those in the previous calculation
procedure, the effect of deflecting the tendons is to permit an increase of 281 lb/in2
(1937.5 kPa) in the absolute value of the prestress at top and bottom. The accompanying
increase in/, is 0.85(281) - 239 lb/in2 (1647.9 kPa).

3. Find the minimum prestressing force and the eccentricity ef

Examination of Fig. 34 shows that fcai is not affected by the form of trajectory used.
Therefore, as in the previous calculation procedure, F1 = 85,920 Ib (382,172.2 N);/^, =
1074 - 85,92Oe1/!33 = -471; ^1 = 2.39 in (60.706 mm).
Although it is not required, the value of fbp, = 1074 + 1074 - (-471) = +2619 lb/in2
(+18,058kPa), orfbp = 2681 - 53/0.85 = +2619 lb/in2 (+18,058kPa).

4. Establish the allowable range of values of e2

At the supports, the tendons may be placed an equal distance above or below the center.
Then e2,max = 1.96 in (23.44 mm); e2,min = -1.96 in (-23.44 mm).

BEAM WITH CURVED TENDONS

The beam in the second previous calculation procedure is to be prestressed by tendons ly-
ing in a parabolic arc. Evaluate the allowable unit superimposed load, the magnitude of
the prestressing force, the eccentricity of this force at midspan, and the increase in capac-
ity accruing from the use of curved tendons.

Calculation Procedure:

1. Tentatively set the initial and final stresses at midspan
equal to their allowable values to secure the allowable unit
superimposed load

Since the prestressing force has a parabolic trajectory, lines EFG in Fig. 356 and c will be

parabolic in the present case. Therefore, it is possible to achieve the full allowable initial
stresses at midspan. Thus,/w =fb - 374 = +2400;/^ =ftp, + 374 - -190;/^ = +2774 lb/in2
(+19,126.7 kPa);^ = -564 lb/in* (-3888.8 kPa);/^= 0.85(2774) - 374 +fbs = -425; ftf=
0.85(-564) + 374 +fts = + 2250; fbs = -2409 lb/in2 (-16,610.1 kPa);/5 = +2356 lb/in2
(+16,244.6 kPa). The latter value controls.
Also, w, = 83(2356/374) = 523 Ib/lin ft (7632.6 N/m); 523/452 =1.16. Thus the capac-
ity is increased 16 percent.
When the foregoing calculations are compared with those in the earlier calculation
procedure, the effect of using parabolic tendons is to permit an increase of 374 lb/in2
(2578.7 kPa) in the absolute value of the prestress at top and bottom. The accompanying
increase in/, is 0.85(374) = 318 lb/in2 (2192.6 kPa).

2. Find the minimum prestressing force and its eccentricity
at midspan

As before, F1 = 85,920 Ib (382,172.2 N); ^ = 1074 - 85,920^/133 = -564; e = 2.54 in
(64.516mm).

DETERMINATION OF SECTION MODULI

A beam having a cross-sectional area of 500 in2 (3226 cm2) sustains a beam-weight mo-
ment equal to 3500 in-kips (395.4 kN-m) at midspan and a superimposed moment that
varies parabolically from 9000 in-kips (1016.8 kN-m) at midspan to O at the supports. The
allowable stresses are: initial, +2400 and-190 lb/in2 (+16,548 and-1310.1 kPa);/ma/, +
2250 and -200 lb/in2 (+15,513.8 and -1379 kPa). The member will be prestressed by ten-
dons deflected at the quarter points. Determine the section moduli corresponding to bal-
anced design, the magnitude of the prestressing force, and its eccentricity in the center in-
terval. Assume that the calculated eccentricity is attainable (i.e., that the centroid of the
tendons will fall within the confines of the section while satisfying insulation require-
ments).

Calculation Procedure:

1. Equate the critical initial stresses, and the critical final stresses,
to their allowable values

Let Mw and Ms denote the indicated moments at midspan; the corresponding moments at
the quarter point are three-fourths as large. The critical initial stresses occur at the quarter
point, while the critical final stresses occur at midspan. After equating the stresses to their
allowable values, solve the resulting simultaneous equations to find the section moduli
and prestresses. Thus: stresses in bottom fiber, fbi -fbp - Q.15MJSb = +2400;/^ = 0.85/J,p
-MJSh-M/Sh = -200. Solving gives Sb = (Ms + 0.3625MJ/2240 - 4584 in3(75,131.7
cm3) mdfbp = + 2973 lb/in2 (+20,498.8 kPa); stresses in top fiber, fti =ftp + Q.I 5(MJSt) =
-l9Q;ftf = 0.854 + M*ISt+ MA = +2250. Solving yields St = (Ms + 0.3625MJ/2412 =
4257 in3 (69,772.2 cm3) andftp = -807 lb/in2 (-5564.2 kPa).

2. Evaluate F1- and e

In this instance, e denotes the eccentricity in the center interval. Thusfbp = FJA + F^/Sb =
+2973; f^ = F1IA - FtelSt = -807; F1 = (2973S6 - 8Q7St)A/(Sb + S1) = 576,500 Ib
(2,564,272.0 N); e = 2973S1JF1 - S1JA = 14.47 in (367.538 mm).

3. Alternatively, evaluate F/ by assigning an arbitrary depth to
the member

Thus, set A = 10 in (254 mm); yb = SJil(Sb + St) = 4.815 in (122.301 mm);/cfl/ =fbp - (fbp -
ftp)yblh = 2973 - (2973 + 807)0.4815 = + 1153 lb/in2 (+7949.9 kPa); F1 = 1153(500) =
576,500 Ib (2,564,272.0 N).

EFFECT Of INCREASE IN BEAM SPAN

Consider that the span of the beam in the previous calculation procedure increases by 10
percent, thereby causing the midspan moment due to superimposed load to increase by 21
percent. Show that the member will be adequate with respect to flexure if all cross-sec-
tional dimensions are increased by 7.2 percent. Compute the new eccentricity in the cen-
ter interval, and compare this with the original value.

Calculation Procedure:

1. Calculate the new section properties and bending moments

Thus A = 500(1.072)2 = 575 in2 (3709.9 cm2); Sb = 4584(1.072)3 = 5647 in3 (92,554.3
cm3); S1 = 4257(1.072)3 = 5244 in3 (85,949.2 cm3); M5 = 9000(1.21) = 10,890 in-kips
(1230.4 kN-m); Mw = 3500(1.072)2(1.21) = 4867 in-kips (549.9 kN-m).

2. Compute the required section moduli, prestresses, prestressing
force, and its eccentricity in the central interval, using the same
sequence as in the previous calculation procedure

Thus Sb = 5649 in3 (92,587.1 cm3); St = 5246 in3 (85,981.9 cm3). Both these values are ac-
ceptable. Then4, = + 3046 lb/in2 (+21,002.2 kPa);^ = -886 lb/in2 (-6108.9 kPa); F1 =
662,800 Ib (2,948,134.4 N); e = 16.13 in (409.7 mm). The eccentricity has increased by
11.5 percent.
In practice, it would be more efficient to increase the vertical dimensions more than
the horizontal dimensions. Nevertheless, as the span increases, the eccentricity increases
more rapidly than the depth.

EFFECT OF BEAM OVERLOAD

The beam in the second previous calculation procedure is subjected to a 10 percent over-
load. How does the final stress in the bottom fiber compare with that corresponding to the
design load?

Calculation Procedure:

1. Compute the value of fbs under design load

Thus,/fe = -MJSb = -9,000,000/4584 = -1963 lb/in2 (-13,534.8 kPa).

2. Compute the increment or fbs caused by overload and the
revised value of fbf

Thus, A/fa = 0.10(-1963) = -196 lb/in2 (-1351.4 kPa); ^7 = -200 - 196 = -396 lb/in2
(-2730.4 kPa). Therefore, a 10 percent overload virtually doubles the tensile stress in the
member.

PRESTRESSED-CONCRETE BEAM
DESIGN GUIDES

On the basis of the previous calculation procedures, what conclusions may be drawn that
will serve as guides in the design of prestressed-concrete beams?

Calculation Procedure:

1. Evaluate the results obtained with different forms of tendons

The capacity of a given member is increased by using deflected rather than straight ten-
dons, and the capacity is maximized by using parabolic tendons. (However, in the case of
a pretensioned beam, an economy analysis must also take into account the expense in-
curred in deflecting the tendons.)

2. Evaluate the prestressing force

For a given ratio of yjy^ the prestressing force that is required to maximize the capacity
of a member is a function of the cross-sectional area and the allowable stresses. It is inde-
pendent of the form of the trajectory.

3. Determine the effect of section moduli

If the section moduli are in excess of the minimum required, the prestressing force is min-
imized by setting the critical values o ffbf and/, equal to their respective allowable values.
In this manner, points A and B in Fig. 34 are placed at their limiting positions to the left.

4. Determine the most economical short-span section

For a short-span member, an I section is most economical because it yields the required
section moduli with the minimum area. Moreover, since the required values of Sb and St
differ, the area should be disposed unsymmetrically about middepth to secure these val-
ues.

5. Consider the calculated value of e

Since an increase in span causes a greater increase in the theoretical eccentricity than in
the depth, the calculated value of e is not attainable in a long-span member because the
centroid of the tendons would fall beyond the confines of the section. For this reason,
long-span members are generally constructed as T sections. The extensive flange area el-
evates the centroidal axis, thus making it possible to secure a reasonably large eccentrici-
ty.

6. Evaluate the effect of overload

A relatively small overload induces a disproportionately large increase in the tensile
stress in the beam and thus introduces the danger of cracking. Moreover, owing to the
presence of many variable quantities, there is not a set relationship between the beam ca-
pacity at allowable final stress and the capacity at incipient cracking. It is therefore imper-
ative that every prestressed-concrete beam be subjected to an ultimate-strength analysis to
ensure that the beam provides an adequate factor of safety.

KERN DISTANCES

The beam in Fig. 36 has the following properties: A = 850 in2 (5484.2 cm2); Sb = 11,400
in3 (186,846.0 cm3); St = 14,400 in3 (236,016.0 cm3). A prestressing force of 630 kips
(2802.2 kN) is applied with an eccentricity of 24 in (609.6 mm) at the section under in-

vestigation. Calculate fbp and ftp by expressing these
stresses as functions of the kern distances of the sec-
tion.

Calculation Procedure:

1. Consider the prestressing force to be
applied at each kern point, and evaluate
the kern distances

Let Qb and Qt denote the points at which a compres-
sive force must be applied to induce a zero stress in the
top and bottom fiber, respectively. These are referred to
as the kern points of the section, and the distances kb
and kt, from the centroidal axis to these points are
called the kern distances.
Consider the prestressing force to be applied at each
kem point in ^m Set me stresses/^, and/6/? equal to
zero to evaluate the kern distances kb and kt , respec-
tively. Thus 4 = FJA - FMS, = O, Eq. a;fbp = F1IA -
Ffit/Sh = O, Eq. b. Then

And, kb = 14,400/850 = 16.9 in (429.26 mm); kt = 11,400/850 = 13.4 in (340.36 mm).

2. Express the stresses fbp and ftp associated with the actual
eccentricity as functions of the kern distances

By combining the stress equations with Eqs. a and b, the following equations are ob-
tained:

Substituting numerical values gives fbp = 630,000(13.4 + 24)711,400 = +2067 lb/in2

3. Alternatively, derive Eq. 56 by considering the increase
in prestress caused by an increase in eccentricity

Thus, A/Jp = F^e/Sb; therefore,/^ = Ffa + e)/Sb.

MAGNEL DIAGRAM CONSTRUCTION

The data pertaining to a girder having curved tendons are A = 500 in2 (3226.0 cm2); Sb =
5000 in3 (81,950 cm3); St = 5340 in3 (87,522.6 cm3); Mw = 3600 in-kips (406.7 kN-m);
M5 = 9500 in-kips (1073.3 kN-m). The allowable stresses are: initial, + 2400 and -190
lb/in2 (+ 16,548 and-1310.1 kPa); final, + 2250 and -425 lb/in2 (+15,513.8 and-2930.4
kPa). (a) Construct the Magnel diagram for this member, (b) Determine the minimum
prestressing force and its eccentricity by referring to the diagram, (c) Determine the pre-
stressing force if the eccentricity is restricted to 18 in (457.2 mm).

Calculation Procedure:

1. Set the initial stress in the bottom fiber at midspan equal to
or less than its allowable value, and solve for the reciprocal of F1

In this situation, the superimposed load is given, and the sole objective is to minimize the
prestressing force. The Magnel diagram is extremely useful for this purpose because it
brings into sharp focus the relationship between F1 and e. In this procedure, let fbi and fbf
and so forth represent the allowable stresses.
Thus,

2. Set the final stress in the bottom fiber at midspan equal to
or algebraically greater than its allowable value, and solve for the
reciprocal of F1-

Thus,

rj(kt + e)
T1 ~ Mw + Ms+fbfSb

3. Repeat the foregoing procedure with respect to the top fiber

Thus,

FIGURE 37. Magnel diagram.

7. For the case where e is restricted to 18 in (457.2 mm), minimize
FJ by determining the ordinate of point G on line b

Thus, in Fig. 37, l/F{ = (10 + 18)712.91; F1 = 461 kips (2050.5 kN).
The Magnel diagram may be applied to a beam having deflected tendons by substitut-
ing for Mw in Eqs. 51a and 57c the beam-weight moment at the deflection point.

CAMBER OF A BEAM AT TRANSFER

The following pertain to a simply supported prismatic beam: L = 36 ft (11.0 m); / =
40,000 in4 (166.49 dm4);/,;. = 4000 lb/in2 (27,580.0 kPa); ww = 340 Ib/lin ft (4961.9
N/m); Ft = 430 kips (1912.6 kN); e = 8.8 in (223.5 mm) at midspan. Calculate the camber
of the member at transfer under each of these conditions: (a) the tendons are straight
across the entire span; (b) the tendons are deflected at the third points, and the eccentrici-
ty at the supports is zero; (c) the tendons are curved parabolically, and the eccentricity at
the supports is zero.

Calculation Procedure:

1. Evaluate E0 at transfer, using the ACI Code

Review the moment-area method of calculating beam deflections, which is summarized
earlier. Consider an upward displacement (camber) as positive, and let the symbols Ap,
Aw, and A1-, defined earlier, refer to the camber at midspan.

Thus, using the ACI Code, E0 = (145)15(33)(4000)°-5 = 3,644,000 IMn2 (25,125.4
MPa).

2. Construct the prestress-moment diagrams associated
with the three cases described

See .Fig. 38. By symmetry, the elastic curve corresponding to F1 is horizontal at midspan.
Consequently, A^ equals the deviation of the elastic curve at the support from the tangent
to this curve at midspan.

3. Using the literal values shown in Fig. 38, develop an equation
for Ap by evaluating the tangential deviation; substitute
numerical values

Thus, case a:

or A^ = 430,000(8.8)(36)2(144)/[8(3,644,000)(40,000)] = 0.61 in (15.494 mm). For case

or Ap = 0.51 in (12.954 mm).

4. Compute Aw

Thus, Aw - -5ww/,4/(384£c/) = -0.09 in (-2.286 mm).

5. Combine the foregoing results to obtain A7-

Thus: case a, A, = 0.61 - 0.09 = 0.52 in (13.208 mm); case b, A, = 0.52 - 0.09 = 0.43 in
(10.922 mm); case c, A,- = 0.51 - 0.09 - 0.42 in (10.688 mm).

DESIGN OF A DOUBLE-T ROOF BEAM

The beam in Fig. 39 was selected for use on a simple span of 40 ft (12.2 m) to carry the
following loads: roofing, 12 lb/ft2 (574.5 N/m2) snow, 40 lb/ft2 (1915.1 N/m2); total, 52
lb/ft2 (2489.6 N/m2). The member will be pretensioned with straight seven-wire strands,
Yi6 in (11.11 mm) diameter, having an area of 0.1089 in2 (0.70262 cm2) each and an ulti-
mate strength of 248,000 lb/in2 (1,709,960.0 kPa). The concrete strengths are/c' = 5000
lb/in2 (34,475.0 kPa) and/c; = 4000 lb/in2 (27,580.0 kPa). The allowable stresses are: ini-
tial, +2400 and -190 lb/in2 (+16,548.0 and - 1310.1 kPa); final, +2250 and -425 lb/in2
(+15,513.8 and -2930.4 kPa). Investigate the adequacy of this section, and design the ten-
dons. Compute the camber of the beam after the concrete has hardened and all dead loads
are present. For this calculation, assume that the final value of E0 is one-third of that at
transfer.

Calculation Procedure:

1. Compute the properties of the cross section

Let fbfandftf denote the respective stresses at midspan andfbi and/, denote the respective
stresses at the support Previous calculation procedures demonstrated that where the sec-
tion moduli are excessive, the minimum prestressing force is obtained by setting fbf and fti
equal to their allowable values.
Thus,4 = 316 in2 (2038.8 cm2); /= 7240 in4 (30.14 dm4);^ = 10.98 in (278.892 mm);
yt = 5.02 in (127.508 mm); Sb = 659 in3 (10,801.0 cm3); St = 1442 in3 (23,614 cm3); ww =
(316/144)150 = 329 Ib/lin ft (4801.4 N/m).

2. Calculate the total midspan moment due to gravity loads
and the corresponding stresses

Thus ws = 52(6) = 312 Ib/lin ft (4553.3 N/m); ww, = 329 Ib/lin ft (4801.4 N/m); and Mw +
Ms = (1/8)(641)(402)(12) = 1,538,000 in-lb (173,763.2 N-m);/^ +fbs = -1,538,000/659 =
-2334 lb/in2 (-16,092.9 kPa);/^ +fta = +1,538,000/1442 - +1067 lb/in2 (+7357.0 kPa).

FIGURE 39. Double-T roof beam.

3. Determine whether the section moduli are excessive

Do this by setting fbf and/, equal to their allowable values and computing the correspon-
ding values of/w and/^. Thus,^7= 0.85/^ - 2334 - -425; therefore,/^ - +2246 lb/in2
(+15,486.2 kPa);/ri = ftp = -190 lb/in2 (-1310.1 kPa);/w =4, ='+2246 < 2400 lb/in2
(+16,548.0 kPa). This is acceptable. Also, ^= 0.85(-19O) + 1067 = +905 < 2250 lb/in2
(+15,513.8 kPa); this is acceptable. The section moduli are therefore excessive.

4. Find the minimum
prestressing force and its
eccentricity

Refer to Fig. 40. Thus,/^ = +2246 lb/in2
(+15,486.2 kPa); 
ftp = -190 
lb/in2
(-1310.1 kPa); slope of AB = 2246 -
(-190)716 = 152.3 Ib/(in2-in) (41.33
MPa/m); F1IA = CD = 2246 - 10.98
(152.3) = 574 lb/in2 (3957.7 kPa); F1 =
574(316) = 181,400 Ib (806,867.2 N);
slope of AB = Fie/I = 152.3; e =
152.3(7240)/!81,400 = 6.07 in (154.178
mm^ 

5. Determine the number of
strands required, and establish
their disposition

FIGURE 40. Prestress diagram.

In accordance with the ACI Code, allowable initial force per strand = 0.1089
(0.70)(248,000) = 18,900 Ib (84,067.2 N); number required - 181,400/18,900 = 9.6.
Therefore, use 10 strands (5 in each web) stressed to 18,140 Ib (80,686.7 N) each.
Referring to the ACI Code for the minimum clear distance between the strands, we
find the allowable center-to-center spacing = 4(Yi6) = I3A in (44.45 mm). Use a 2-in (50.8-
mm) spacing. In Fig. 41, locate the centroid of the steel, or y = ( 2 ^ 2 +1 x 4)/5 = 1.60 in
(40.64 mm); v = 10.98 - 6.07 - 1.60 = 3.31 in (84.074 mm); set v = 3Vi6 in (84.138 mm).

6. Calculate the allowable ultimate moment of the member
in accordance with the ACI Code

Thus, As = 10(0.1089) = 1.089 in2 (7.0262 cm2); d = yt + e = 5.02 + 6.07 - 11.09 in
(281.686 mm);;? = AJ(bd) = 1.089/[72(11.09)] = 0.00137.

FIGURE 41. Location of tendons.

Compute the steel stress and resultant tensile force at ultimate load:

/

(275,800.0 kPa), and set s = 12 in (304.8 mm). Then Av = 12(20,200 - 0.85 x
17,000)/[0.85(11.09)(40,000)] = 0.184 in2/ft (3.8949 cm2/m). This is the area required at
the ends.

or Av = (1.089/80)(248,000/40,000)12/(12.74 x 11.09)°5 = 0.085 in2/ft (1.7993 cm2/m).

9. Calculate the camber under full dead load

From the previous procedure, E0 = (1/3)(3.644)(10)6 - 1.215 x 106 lb/in2 (8.377 x 106
kPa); EJ= 1.215(10)6(7240) = 8.8 x io9 lb-in2 (25.25 x io6 N-m2); AADL = -5(401)
(40)4(1728)/[384(8.8)(10)9] = -2.62 in (-66.548 mm). By Eq. 58, A^ = 0.85(181,400)
(6.07)(40)2(144)/[8(8.8)(10)9] = 3.06 in (77.724 mm); ); A = 3.06 - 2.62 = 0.44 in (11.176
mm).

DESIGN OFA POSTTENSIONED GIRDER

The girder in Fig. 42 has been selected for use on a 90-ft (27.4-m) simple span to carry the
following superimposed loads: dead load, 1160 Ib/lin ft (16,928.9 N/m), live load, 1000
Ib/lin ft (14,593.9 N/m). The girder will be posttensioned with Freyssinet cables. The con-
crete strengths are/; = 5000 lb/in2 (34,475 kPa) and/c; = 4000 lb/in2 (27,580 kPa). The
allowable stresses are: initial, + 2400 and-190 lb/in2 (+ 16,548 and-1310.1 kPa); final,
+2250 and -425 lb/in2 (+ 15,513.8 and -2930.4 kPa). Complete the design of this mem-
ber, and calculate the camber at transfer.

FIGURE 42

Calculation Procedure:

1. Compute the properties of the cross section

Since the tendons will be curved, the initial stresses at midspan may be equated to the al-
lowable values. The properties of the cross section are A = 856 in2 (5522.9 cm2); / =
394,800 in4 (1643 dm4); yb = 34.6 in (878.84 mm); yt = 21A in (695.96 mm); Sb = 11,410
in3 (187,010 cm3); St = 14,410 in3 (236,180 cm3); ww = 892 Ib/lin ft (13,017.8 N/m).

2. Calculate the stresses at midspan caused by gravity loads

Thus/^ = -950 lb/in2 (-6550.3 kPa);/fe = -2300 lb/in2 (-15,858.5 kPa);/^ = +752 lb/in2
(+5185.0 kPa);.4 = + 1820 lb/in2 (+12,548.9 kPa).

3. Test the section adequacy

To do this, equate^and fti to their allowable values and compute the corresponding val-
ues o f /k andftf. Thusfbf = 0.85/^ - 950 - 2300 = -425;/, =ftp + 752 = -190; therefore,
fbp = +3324 lb/in2 (+22,919.0 kPa) andftp = -942 lb/in2 (-6495.1 kPa);/w = +3324 - 950
= +2374 < 2400 lb/in2 (16,548.0 kPa). This is acceptable. And^-= 0.85(-942) + 752 +
1820 = + 1771 < 2250 lb/in2 (15,513.8 kPa). This is acceptable. The section is therefore
adequate.

4. Find the minimum prestressing force and its eccentricity
at midspan

Do this by applying the prestresses found in step 3. Refer to Fig. 43. Slope of AB = [3324
- (-942)]/62 = 68.8 Ib/(in2-in) (18.68 kPa/mm); F1IA = CD = 3324 - 34.6(68.8) = 944
lb/in2 (6508.9 kPa); F1 = 944(856) = 808,100 Ib (3,594,428.8 N); slope of AB = F1ClI =
68.8; e = 68.8(394,800)/808,100 = 33.6 in (853.44 mm). Sinceyb = 34.6 in (878.84 mm),
this eccentricity is excessive.

5. Select the maximum feasible eccentricity; determine the
minimum prestressing force associated with this value

Trye = 34.6 - 3.0 = 31.6 in (802.64 mm). To obtain the minimum value OfF1, equate/6/to
its allowable value. Check the remaining stresses. As before,/^ = +3324 lb/in2 (+22,919
kPa). But fa, = F,-/856 + 31.6F1Vl 1,410 = +3324; therefore F1 = 844,000 Ib (3754.1 kN).
Also,/0, = -865 lb/in2 (-5964.2 kPa);/w = +2374 lb/in2 (+16,368.7 kPa);/, = -113 lb/in2
(-779.1 kPa);/^ = + 1837 lb/in2 (+12,666.1 kPa).
6. Design the tendons, and establish their pattern at midspan
Refer to a table of the properties of Freyssinet cables, and select 12/0.276 cables. The des-
ignation indicates that each cable consists of 12 wires of 0.276-in (7.0104-mm) diameter.

FIGURE 43. Prestress diagram.

FIGURE 44. Location of tendons at midspan.

The ultimate strength is 236,000 lb/in2 (1,627,220 kPa). Then A8 = 0.723 in2 (4.6648 cm2)
per cable. Outside diameter of cable = I5Xs in (41.27 mm). Recommended final prestress =
93,000 Ib (413,664 N) per cable; initial prestress = 93,000/0.85 = 109,400 Ib (486,611.2
N) per cable. Therefore, use eight cables at an initial prestress of 105,500 Ib (469,264.0
N) each.
A section of the ACI Code requires a minimum cover of IVi in (38.1 mm) and another
section permits the ducts to be bundled at the center. Try the tendon pattern shown in Fig.
44. Thus,.y = [6(2.5) + 2(4.5)]/8 = 3.0 in (76.2 mm). This is acceptable.

7. Establish the trajectory of the prestressing force

Construct stress diagrams to represent the initial and final stresses in the bottom and top
fibers along the entire span.
For convenience, set e = O at the supports. The prestress at the ends is thereforeT^, =ftp
= 844,000/856 = +986 lb/in2 (+6798.5 kPa). Since e varies parabolically from maximum
at mid-span to zero at the supports, it follows that the prestresses also vary parabolically.
In Fig. 45a, draw the parabolic arc AB with summit at B to represent the absolute val-
ue offbp. Draw the parabolic arc OC in the position shown to represent^. The vertical
distance between the arcs at a given section represents the value offbi; this value is maxi-
mum at midspan.
In Fig. 45&, draw A 'B' to represent the absolute value of the final prestress; draw OC
to represent the absolute value offbw +fbs. The vertical distance between the arcs repre-
sents the value offbf. This stress is compressive in the interval ON and tensile in the inter-
val NM.
Construct Fig. 45c and d in an analogous manner. The stress// is compressive in the
interval OQ.

8. Calculate the allowable ultimate moment of the member

The midspan section is critical in this respect. Thus, d = 62 - 3 = 59.0 in (1498.6 mm);
A8 = 8(0.723) = 5.784 in2 (37.3184 cm2);/? =Asl(bd) = 5.784/[32(59.O)] = 0.00306.
Apply Eq. 61, or/SM = 236,000(1 - 0.5 x 0.00306 x 236,000/5000) = 219,000 lb/in2
(1,510,005.0kPa). Also, TU=AJSU = 5.784(219,000) = 1,267,000Ib(5,635,616.0N). The
concrete area under stress = 1,267,000/[0.85(5,00O)] = 298 in2 (1922.7 cm2). This is the
shaded area in Fig. 46, as the following calculation proves: 32(9.53) - 4.59(1.53) = 305 -
7 = 298 in2 (1922.7 cm2).
Locate the centroidal axis of the stressed area, or m = [305(4.77) - 7(9.53 - 0.51)]/
298 = 4.67 in (118.618 mm); M14 = OTJd = 0.90(1,267,000)(59.0 - 4.67) = 61,950,000
in-lb(6,999,111.0N-m).

FIGURE 46. Concrete area under stress at ultimate load.

Calculate the steel index to ascertain that it is below the limit imposed by the ACI
Code. Refer to Fig. 46. Or, area of ABCD = 8(9.53) = 76.24 in2 (491.900 cm2). The steel
area Asr that is required to balance the force on this web strip is Asr = 5.784(76.24)7298 =
1.48 in2 (9.549 cm2); q = Asrfsu(b' dfc') = 1.48(219,000)/[8(59.0)(5000)] = 0.137 < 0.30.
This is acceptable.

9. Calculate the required ultimate-moment capacity as given
by the ACI Code

Thus, WM = 1.5(892 + 1160) + 1.8(1000) = 4878 Ib/lin ft (71,189.0 N/m); Mu required =
(!/8)(4878)(90)2(12) = 59,270,000 in-lb (6,696,324.6 N-m). This is acceptable. The mem-
ber is therefore adequate with respect to its ultimate-moment capacity.

10. Design the web reinforcement

Follow the procedure given in step 8 of the previous calculation procedure.

11. Design the end block

This is usually done by applying isobar charts to evaluate the tensile stresses caused by
the concentrated prestressing forces. Refer to Winter et al.—Design of Concrete Struc-
tures, McGraw-Hill.

12. Compute the camber at transfer

Referring to earlier procedures in this section, we see that EJ = 3.644(10)6(394,800) =
1.44 x 1012 lb-in2 (4.132 x 109 N-m2). Also, Aw = -5(892)(90)4(1728)/[384(1.44)(10)12 =

the prestress shear and prestress moment at section C (a) by applying the properties of the
trajectory at C; (b) by considering the prestressing action of the steel on the concrete in
the interval A C.

Calculation Procedure:

1. Compute tfie eccentricity and slope of the trajectory at C

Use Eqs. 66 and 67. Let m denote the slope of the trajectory. This is positive if the trajec-
tory slopes downward to the right. Thus ea - 2em + eb = I - 60 - 3 = -62 in (1574.8 mm);
2>ea - 4em + eb, = 3 - 120 - 3 = -120 in (-3048 mm); em = 2(-62)(20/100)2 + 120(20/100)
+ 1 = 20.04 in (509.016 mm); mc = 4(-62/12)(20/1002) - (-120/12 x 100) = 0.0587.

2. Compute the prestress shear
and moment at C

Thus Vp0 = -mcFt = -0.0587(860,000) =
-50,480 Ib (-224,535.0 N); Mpc = -Fte
= -860,000(20.04) = -17,230,000 
in - Ib
(-1,946,645.4 N-m). This concludes the solu-
tion to part a.

3. Evaluate the vertical
component w of the radial force
on the concrete in a unit
longitudinal distance

An alternative approach to this problem is to
analyze the forces that the tendons exert on
the concrete in the interval AC, namely, the 
prestressing force transmitted at the end and 
the radial forces resulting from curvature of
the tendons.
Consider the component w to be positive
if directed downward. In Fig. 49, Vpr-Vpq =
-Ft(mr - mq); therefore, A^ /A jc = -F,Am/Ax. Apply Eq. 68: dVpldx = -Fjdm/dx =
-(4FJL2)(ea ~ 2em + eb

FIGURE 49. Free-body diagram of
concrete.

FIGURE 50

This result discloses that when the trajectory is parabolic, w is uniform across the
span. The radial forces are always directed toward the center of curvature, since the ten-
sile forces applied at their ends tend to straighten the tendons. In the present instance, w =
(4F//1002)(-62/12) = - 0.002067F1 Ib/lin ft (-0.00678F1 N/m).

4. Find the prestress shear at C

By Eq. 690, ma = - [-120/(1OO x 12)] = 0.1; Vpa = -0.1F1; Vpc = Vpa - 2Ow = F,(-0.1 + 20
x 0.002067) = -0.0587F1 = -50,480 Ib (-224,535.0 N).

5. Find the prestress moment at C

Thus, Mpc = Mpa + VpJiTM) - 20w(120) = F1 - 0.1 x 240 + 2 Ox 0.002067 x 120) -
-20.04F1- = -17,230,000 in-lb (1,946,645.4 N-m).

PRESTRESS MOMENTS IN A
CONTINUOUS BEAM

The continuous prismatic beam in Fig. 50 has a prestressing force of 96 kips (427.0 kN)
on a parabolic trajectory. The eccentricities are ea = —0.40 in (—10.16 mm); ed — +0.60 in
(15.24 mm); eb, = -1.20 in (-30.48 mm); ee = +0.64 in (16.256 mm); ec = -0.60 in
(-15.24 mm). Construct the prestress-moment diagram for this member, indicating all
significant values.

Calculation Procedure:

1. Find the value of wL2/4 for each span by applying Eq. 71

Refer to Fig. 51. Since members AB and BC are constrained to undergo an identical rota-
tion at B, there exists at this section a bending mo-
ment Mkb in addition to that resulting from the ec-
centricity of F1. The moment Mkb 
induces
reactions at the supports. Thus, at every section of
the beam there is a moment caused by continuity
of the member as well as the moment -Fte. The
moment Mkb is termed the continuity moment; its
numerical value is directly proportional to the dis-
tance from the given section to the end support.
The continuity moment may be evaluated by
adopting the second method of solution in the pre-
vious calculation procedure, since this renders the

continuous member amenable to analysis by the theorem of three moments or moment
distribution.
Determine wL2/4 for each span: span AB, w^/4 = F/-0.40 - 1.20 - 1.20) = -2.80F,
in-lb (-03163F, N-m); span BC, w2L2
2/4 = F,.(-1.20 - 1.28 - 0.60) = -3.08F1 in-lb
(-0.3479F,N-m).

2. Determine the true prestress moment at B in terms of F1

Apply the theorem of three moments; by subtraction, find Mkb. Thus, MpJL1 + 2M^(L1 +
L2) + Mp0L2
 = ~ W1L]M - w2L2/4. Substitute the value O fL1 and L2, in feet (meters), and
divide each term by F1, or 0.40(60) + (2Af^ x 15OyF1 + 0.60(90) = 2.80(60) + 3.08(90).
Solving gives Mpb = 1.224F, in-lb (0.1383F, N-m). Also, Mkb = Mpb - (-F^6) = F1(1.224 -
1.20) = 0.024F1-. Thus, the continuity moment at B is positive.

3. Evaluate the prestress moment at the supports and at midspan

Using foot-pounds (newton-meters) 
in 
the moment evaluation yields Mpa =
0.40(96,000)712 = 3200 ft-lb (4339.2 N-m); Mpb = 1.224(96,000)712 = 9792 ft-lb (13,278
N-m); Mpc = 0.60(96,000)712 = 4800 ft-lb (6508.0 N-m); Mpd = -Ffd + MM = Ff<-0.60 +
Y2 x 0.024)712 = -4704 ft-lb (-6378 N-m); Mpe = F/-0.64 + % x 0.024)712 = -5024 ft-lb
(-6812 N-m).

4. Construct the prestress-moment diagram

Figure 52 shows this diagram. Apply Eq. 70 to locate and evaluate the maximum negative
moments. Thus, AF = 25.6 ft (7.80 m); BG = 49.6 ft (15.12 m); Mpf= -4947 ft-lb (-6708
N-m); Mpg = -5151 ft-lb (-6985 N-m).

PRINCIPLE OF LINEAR TRANSFORMATION

For the beam in Fig. 50, consider that the parabolic trajectory of the prestressing force is
displaced thus: ea and ec are held constant as eb is changed to -2.0 in (-50.80 mm), the ec-
centricity at any intermediate section being decreased algebraically by an amount directly
proportional to the distance from that section to A or C. Construct the prestress-moment
diagram.

Calculation Procedure:

1. Compute the revised eccentricities

The modification described is termed a linear transformation of the trajectory. Two meth-
ods are presented. Steps 1 through 4 comprise method 1; the remaining steps comprise
method 2.
The revised eccentricities are ea = -0.40 in (-10.16 mm); ed = +0.20 in (5.08 mm);
eb = -2.00 in (-50.8 mm); ee = + 0.24 in (6.096 mm); ec = -0.60 in (-15.24 mm).

2. Find the value of wL2/4 for each span

Apply Eq. 71: span AB, wvL\l4 =F/-0.40 - 0.40 - 2.00) = -2.8OF1; span BC, w2L2
F,(-2.00 - 0.48 - 0.60) = -3.08F1,
These results are identical with those obtained in the previous calculation procedure.
The change in eb is balanced by an equal change in 2ed and 2ee.

2/4 =

3. Determine the true prestress moment at B by applying
the theorem of three moments; then find Mkb

Refer to step 2 in the previous calculation procedure. Since the linear transformation of

the trajectory has not affected the value O fW1 and W2, the value ofMpb remains constant.
Thus, Mkb = Mpb - (-Fteb) =F,{1 .224 - 2.0) = -0.776F,.

4. Evaluate the prestress moment at midspan

Thus, Mpj = -Ffed+ MM = F,(-0.20 - V2 x 0.776)712 = -4704 ft-lb (-6378.6 N-m); Mpe =
F,(-0.24 - Y2 x 0.776)712 = -5024 ft-lb (-6812.5 N-m).
These results are identical with those in the previous calculation procedure. The
change in the eccentricity moment is balanced by an accompanying change in the conti-
nuity moment. Since three points determine a parabolic arc, the prestress moment dia-
gram coincides with that in Fig. 52. This constitutes the solution by method 1.

5. Evaluate the prestress moments

Do this by replacing the prestressing system with two hypothetical systems that jointly in-
duce eccentricity moments identical with those of the true system.
Let e denote the original eccentricity of the prestressing force at a given section and
&e the change in eccentricity that results from the linear transformation. The final eccen-
tricity moment is -Ft(e + ke) = -(F1C + F1^e).
Consider the beam as subjected to two prestressing forces of 96 kips (427.0 kN) each.
One has the parabolic trajectory described in the previous calculation procedure; the other
has the linear trajectory shown in Fig. 53, where ea = Q,eb = -0.80 in (-20.32 mm), and ec

FIGURE 53. Hypothetical prestressing system and forces exerted on concrete.

= O. Under the latter prestressing system, the tendons exert three forces on the concrete-
one at each end and one at the deflection point above the interior support caused by the
change in direction of the prestressing force.
The horizontal component of the prestressing force is considered equal to the force it-
self; it therefore follows that the force acting at the deflection point has no horizontal
component.
Since the three forces that the tendons exert on the concrete are applied directly at the
supports, their vertical components do not induce bending. Similarly, since the forces at A
and C are applied at the centroidal axis, their horizontal components do not induce bend-
ing. Consequently, the prestressing system having the trajectory shown in Fig. 53 does
not cause any prestress moments whatsoever. The prestress moments for the beam in the
present instance are therefore identical with those for the beam in the previous calculation
procedure.
The second method of analysis is preferable to the first because it is general. The first
method demonstrates the equality of prestress moments before and after the linear trans-
formation where the trajectory is parabolic; the second method demonstrates this equality
without regard to the form of trajectory.
In this calculation procedure, the extremely important principle of linear transforma-
tion for a two-span continuous beam was developed. This principle states: The prestress
moments remain constant when the trajectory of the prestressing force is transformed lin-
early. The principle is frequently applied in plotting a trial trajectory for a continuous
beam.
Two points warrant emphasis. First, in a linear transformation, the eccentricities at the
end supports remain constant. Second, the hypothetical prestressing systems introduced
in step 5 are equivalent to the true system solely with respect to bending stresses; the axi-
al stress FJA under the hypothetical systems is double that under the true system.

CONCORDANT TRAJECTORY OFA BEAM

Referring to the beam in the second previous calculation procedure, transform the trajec-
tory linearly to obtain a concordant trajectory.

Calculation Procedure:

1. Calculate the eccentricities of the concordant trajectory

Two principles apply here. First, in a continuous beam, the prestress moment Mp consists
of two elements, a moment -F^e due to eccentricity and a moment Mk due to continuity.
The continuity moment varies linearly from zero at the ends to its maximum numerical
value at the interior support. Second, in a linear transformation, the change in -Fte is off-
set by a compensatory change in Mh with the result that Mp remains constant.
It is possible to transform a given trajectory linearly to obtain a new trajectory having
the characteristic that Mk = Q along the entire span, and therefore Mp = -Fte. The latter is
termed a concordant trajectory. Since Mp retains its original value, the concordant trajec-
tory corresponding to a given trajectory is found simply by equating the final eccentricity
IQ-MpIF1.
Refer to Fig. 50, and calculate the eccentricities of the concordant trajectory. As be-
fore, ea = -0.40 in (-10.16 mm) and ec = -0.60 in (-15.24 mm). Then ed = 4704(12)/

96,000 = +0.588 in (+14.9352 mm); eb = -9792(12)796,000 = -1.224 in (-31.0896 mm);
ee = 5024(12)796,000 = +0.628 in (15.9512 mm).

2. Analyze the eccentricities

All eccentricities have thus been altered by an amount directly proportional to the dis-
tance from the adjacent end support to the given section, and the trajectory has undergone
a linear transformation. The advantage accruing from plotting a concordant trajectory is
shown in the next calculation procedure.

DESIGN OF TRAJECTORY TO OBTAIN
ASSIGNED PRESTRESS MOMENTS

The prestress moments shown in Fig. 52 are to be obtained by applying an initial pre-
stressing force of 72 kips (320.3 kN) with an eccentricity of-2 in (-50.8 mm) at B. De-
sign the trajectory.

Calculation Procedure:

1. Plot a concordant trajectory

Set e = MpIFt, or ea = -3200(12)772,000 = -0.533 in (-13.5382 mm); ed = +0.784 in
(19.9136 mm); eb = -1.632 in (-41.4528 mm); ee = +0.837 in (21.2598 mm); ec = -0.800
in (-20.32 mm).

2. Set eb = desired eccentricity, and transform the trajectory
linearly

Thus, ea = -0.533 in (-13.5382 mm); ec = -0.800 in (-20.32 mm); ed = +0.784 - '/2(2.0OO
- 1.632) = +0.600 in (+15.24 mm); ee = +0.837 - 0.184 = +0.653 in (+16.5862 mm).

EFFECT OF VARYING ECCENTRICITY
ATENDSUPPORT

For the beam in Fig. 50, consider that the parabolic trajectory in span AB is displaced
thus: eb is held constant as ea is changed to -0.72 in (- 18.288 mm), the eccentricity at
every intermediate section being decreased algebraically by an amount directly propor-
tional to the distance from that section to B. Compute the prestress moment at the sup-
ports and at midspan caused by a prestressing force of 96 kips (427.0 kN).

Calculation Procedure:

1. Apply the revised value of e^ repeat the calculations
of the earlier procedure

Thus, Mpa = 5760 ft-lb (7810.6 Nm); Mpd = -3680 ft-lb (-4990.1 N-m); Mpb = 9280 ft-lb
(12,583.7 N-m); Mpe = -5280 ft-lb (-7159.7 N-m); Mp? = 4800 ft-lb (6508.8 N-m).
The change in prestress moment caused by the displacement of the trajectory varies
linearly across each span. Figure 54 compares the original and revised moments along
AB. This constitutes method 1.

2. Replace the prestressing
system with two hypothetical
systems that jointly induce
eccentricity moments identical
with those of the true system
This constitutes method 2. For this pur-
pose, consider the beam to be subjected to
two prestressing forces of 96 kips (427.0
kN) each. One has the parabolic trajectory
described in the earlier procedure; the oth-
er has a trajectory that is linear in each 
span, the eccentricities being ea = -0.72 - 
(-0.40) = -0.32 in (-8.128 mm), eb, = 0, 
and ec = O.

The tendons exert a force on the concrete at A9 B, and C, but only the force at A causes
bending moment.
Thus, Mpa = -Ff0 = -96,000(-0.32)/12 = 2560 ft-lb (3471.4 N-m). Also, Mp0L1+
2Mp13(L1 + L2) + MpcL2 = O. But Mpc = O; therefore, Mpb = -512 ft-lb (-694.3 N-m); Mpd =
/2(2560 - 512) = 1024 ft-lb (1388.5 N-m); Mpe = y2(-5l2) = -256 ft-lb (-347.1 N-m).

4. Find the true prestress moments by superposing the two
hypothetical systems

Thus Mpa = 3200 + 2560 = 5760 ft-lb (7810.6 N-m); Mpd = 4704 + 1024 = 3680 ft-lb
(-4990.1 N-m); Mpb = 9792 - 512 - 9280 ft-lb (12,583.7 N-m); Mpe = 5024 - 256 - -5280
ft-lb (-7159.7 N-m); Mpc = 4800 ft-lb (6508.8 N-m).

DESIGN OF TRAJECTORY FOR A TWO-SPAN
CONTINUOUS BEAM

A T beam that is continuous across two spans of 120 ft (36.6 m) each is to carry a uni-
formly distributed live load of 880 Ib/lin ft (12,842.6 N/m). The cross section has these
properties: A = 1440 in2 (9290.8 cm2); / = 752,000 in4 (3130.05 dm4); yb = 50.6 in
(1285.24 mm); yt = 23.4 in (594.36 mm). The allowable stresses are: initial, +2400 and
- 60 lb/in2 (+16,548.0 and -413.7 kPa); final, +2250 and -60 lb/in2 (+15,513.8 and
413.7 kPa). Assume that the minimum possible distance from the extremity of the sec-
tion to the centroidal axis of the prestressing steel is 9 in (228.6 mm). Determine the
magnitude of the prestressing force, and design the parabolic trajectory (a) using solely
prestressed reinforcement; (b) using a combination of prestressed and non-prestressed
reinforcement.

Calculation Procedure:

1. Compute the section moduli, kern distances, and beam weight

For part a, an exact design method consists of these steps: First, write equations for the

prestress moment, beam-weight moment, maximum and minimum potential superim-
posed-load moment, expressing each moment in terms of the distance from a given sec-
tion to the adjacent exterior support. Second, apply these equations to identify the sec-
tions at which the initial and final stresses are critical. Third, design the prestressing
system to restrict the critical stresses to their allowable range. Whereas the exact method
is not laborious when applied to a prismatic beam carrying uniform loads, this procedure
adopts the conventional, simplified method for illustrative purposes. This consists of di-
viding each span into a suitable number of intervals and analyzing the stresses at each
boundary section.
For simplicity, set the eccentricity at the ends equal to zero. The trajectory will be
symmetric about the interior support, and the vertical component w of the force exerted
by the tendons on the concrete in a unit longitudinal distance will be uniform across the
entire length of member. Therefore, the prestress-moment diagram has the same form as
the bending-moment diagram of a nonprestressed prismatic beam continuous over two
equal spans and subjected to a uniform load across its entire length. It follows as a corol-
lary that the prestress moments at the boundary sections previously referred to have spe-
cific relative values although their absolute values are functions of the prestressing force
and its trajectory.
The following steps constitute a methodical procedure: Evaluate the relative prestress
moments, and select a trajectory having ordinates directly proportional to these moments.
The trajectory thus fashioned is concordant. Compute the prestressing force required to
restrict the stresses to the allowable range. Then transform the concordant trajectory lin-
early to S* are one that lies entirely within the confines of the section. Although the num-
ber of satisfactory concordant trajectories is infinite, the one to be selected is that which
requires the minimum prestressing force. Therefore, the selection of the trajectory and the
calculation of F1 are blended into one operation.
Divide the left span into five intervals, as shown in Fig. 55. (The greater the number of
intervals chosen, the more reliable are the results.)
Computing the moduli, kern distances, and beam weight gives Sb = 14,860 in3
(243,555.4 cm3); St = 32,140 in3 (526,774.6 cm3); kb = 22.32 in (566.928 mm); kt = 10.32
in (262,128 mm); ww = 1500 Ib/lin ft (21,890.9 N/m).

2. Record the bending-moment coefficients C1, C2, and C3

Use Table 4 to record these coefficients at the boundary sections. The subscripts refer to
these conditions of loading: 1, load on entire left span and none on right span; 2, load on
entire right span and none on left span; 3, load on entire length of beam.
To obtain these coefficients, refer to the AISC Manual, case 29, which represents con-
dition 1. Thus, ^1 =

mum and minimum potential live-load bending moments at the respective sections. The
values of C3 also represent the relative eccentricities of a concordant trajectory.
Since the gravity loads induce the maximum positive moment at section 2 and the
maximum negative moment at section B, the prestressing force and its trajectory will be
designed to satisfy the stress requirements at these two sections. (However, the stresses at
all boundary sections will be checked.) The Magnel diagram for section 2 is similar to
that in Fig. 37, but that for section B is much different.

3. Compute the value of C3 at midspan

Thus, C3 = +0.0625.

4. Apply the moment coefficients to find the gravity-load stresses

Record the results in Table 4. Thus Mw = C3(1500)(120)2(12) = 259,200,00OC3 in-lb
(29.3C3 kN-m); fbw = -259,200,OOOC3/14,860 = -17,44OC3; fbsl = -10,23OC1; fbs2 =
-10,23OC2;/^ = 8065C3;/fti = 4731C1;/^ - 4731C2.
Since St far exceeds Sb, it is manifest that the prestressing force must be designed to
confine the bottom-fiber stresses to the allowable range.

5. Consider that a concordant trajectory has been plotted; express
the eccentricity at section B relative to that at section 2

Thus, CiJe2 = -0.1250/+0.0700 = - 1.786; therefore, eb = - 1.78fc?2.

6. Determine the allowable range of values of fbp at sections 2

and B

Refer to Fig. 56. At section 2Jbp < + 3621 IMn2 (+24,966.8 kPa), Eq. a; 0.85/^ => 1221
+ 972 - 60; therefore,/^ > + 2509 IMn2 (+17,299.5 kPa), Eq b. At section BJbp >
-2240 lb/in2 (-15,444.8 kPa), Eq. c; 0.85/J,, < -(218O + 1280) + 2250; fbp < - 1424 lb/in2
(-9818.5kPa),Eq.</.

7. Substitute numerical values in Eq. 56, expressing eb in
terms of e2

The values obtained are 1/F1 < (kt + e£/(362lSb), Eq a'; 1/F1 < (kt + e£/(25Q9Sb), Eq. b';
HFt > (1.786*2 - kt)/(224QSb), Eq. c'; ItF1 < (1.786e2 - &,)/(! 424S6), Eq. J'.

8. Obtain the composite Magnel diagram

Considering the relations in step 7 as equalities, plot the straight lines representing them
to obtain the composite Magnel diagram in Fig. 57. The slopes of the lines have these rel-
ative values: ma = 1/3621; mb = 1/2509; mc = 1.786/2240 = 1/1254; md = 1.786/1424 =
1/797. The shaded area bounded by these lines represents the region of permissible sets of
values of e2 and 1I F1.

9. Calculate the minimum allowable value of F1 and the
corresponding value of e2

In the composite Magnel diagram, this set of values is represented by point A. Therefore,
consider Eqs. b' and c' as equalities, and solve for the unknowns. Or, (10.32 + e2)/2509 =
(1.786^2 - 10.32)/2240; solving gives e2 = 21.87 in (555.5 mm) and F1 = 1,160,000 Ib
(5,159,680.ON).

10. Plot the concordant trajectory

Do this by applying the values of C3 appearing in Table 4; for example, ev = +21.87
(0.0550)70.0700 = +17.19 in (436.626 mm). At midspan, em = +21.87(0.0625)70.0700 =
+19.53 in (496.062 mm).
Record the eccentricities on line 10 of the table. It is apparent that this concordant tra-
jectory is satisfactory in the respect that it may be linearly transformed to one falling
within the confines of the section; this is proved in step 14.

11. Apply Eq. 56 to find fbp and ftp

Record the results in Table 4. For example, at section 1, fbp = 1,160,000(10.32 +
17.19)714,860 - +2148 lb/in2 (+14,810.5 kPa);j^ - 1,160,000(22.32 - 17.19)732,140 = +
185 lb/in2 (+1275.6 kPa).

12. Multiply the values of fbp and ftp by 0.85, and record
the results

These results appear in Table 4.

13. Investigate the stresses at every boundary section

In calculating the final stresses, apply the live-load stress that produces a more critical
condition. Thus, at section \Jbi = -959 + 2148 = + 1189 lb/in2 (+8198.2 kPa);/ft/ = -959
- 691 + 1826 = + 176 lb/in2 (+1213.6 kPa);/,, = + 444 + 185 = + 629 lb/in2 (+4337.0
kPa);/0-= + 444 + 319 + 157 = +920 lb/in2 (+6343.4 kPa). At section 2:fbi = -1221 +
2513 = + 1292 lb/in2 (+8908.3 kPa);/fc/ = -1221 - 972 + 2136 = -57 lb/in2 (-393.0 kPa);
fa = + 565 + 16 = + 581 lb/in2 (+4006.0 kPa ) ; /^= +565 + 450 + 14 = + 1029 lb/in2
(+7095.0 kPa). At section 3:fbi = -785 + 1903 = + 1118 lb/in2 (+7706.8 kPa);/^= -785 -
844 + 1618 = - 11 lb/in2 (-75.8 kPa);/ft- = + 363 + 298 = + 661 lb/in2 (+4558.0 kPa);

= +363 + 390 + 253 = + 1006 lb/in2 (+6936.4 kPa). At section 4:fbi = +349 + 318 = +667
lb/in2 (+4599.OkPa);/^ = +349 -307 + 270 = +312 lb/in2 (+2151.2kPa);or/ft/ = +349 +
512+270 = +1131 lb/in2 (7798.2 kPa);/rf = -161 +1031 = + 870 lb/in2 (+5998.TkPa);/^=
-161 - 237 + 876 = +478 lb/in2 (+3295.8 kPa), arftf= -161 + 142 + 876 = +857 lb/in2
(+5909.0 kPa). At section B:fbi = +2180 - 2243 = -63 lb/in2 (-434.4 kPa);/^ = +2180 +
1280 - 1906 = + 1554 lb/in2 (+10,714.8 kPa); fti = -1008 + 2215 = +1207 lb/in2
(+8322.3kPa); ftf= -1008 -592 + 1883 = +283 lb/in2 (+1951.3 kPa).
In all instances, the stresses lie within the allowable range.

14. Establish the true trajectory by means of a linear
transformation

The imposed limits are emax = yb - 9 = 41.6 in (1056.6 mm), emin = -(yt - 9) = -14.4 in
(-365.76mm).
Any trajectory that falls between these limits and that is obtained by linearly trans-
forming the concordant trajectory is satisfactory. Set eb = -14 in (-355.6 mm), and com-
pute the eccentricity at midspan and the maximum eccentricity.
Thus, em = + 19.53 + 1/2(39.05 - 14) = +32.06 in (814.324 mm). By Eq. 706, es =
-(1/8)(-4 x 32.06 - 14)2/(-2 x 32.06 - 14) = +32.4 in (+823.0 mm) < 41.6 in (1056.6
mm). This is acceptable. This constitutes the solution to part a of the procedure. Steps 15
through 20 constitute the solution to part b.

15. Assign eccentricities to the true trajectory, and check
the maximum eccentricity

The preceding calculation shows that the maximum eccentricity is considerably below the
upper limit set by the beam dimensions. Refer to Fig. 57. If the restrictions imposed by
line c' are removed, e2 may be increased to the value corresponding to a maximum eccen-
tricity of 41.6 in (1056.6 mm), and the value of F1 is thereby reduced. This revised set of
values will cause an excessive initial tensile stress at B9 but the condition can be remedied
by supplying nonprestressed reinforcement over the interior support. Since the excess ten-
sion induced by F1 extends across a comparatively short distance, the savings accruing
from the reduction in prestressing force will more than offset the cost of the added rein-
forcement.
Assigning the following eccentricities to the true trajectory and checking the maxi-
mum eccentricity by applying Eq. 1Ob, we get ea = O; em = + 41 in (1041.4 mm); eb = -l4
in (-355.6 mm); es = -(1X8)M x 41 - 14)2/(-2 x 41 - 14) = +41.3 in (1049.02 mm). This
is acceptable.

16. To analyze the stresses, obtain a hypothetical concordant
trajectory by linearly transforming the true trajectory.

Let y denote the upward displacement at B. Apply the coefficients C3 to find the eccen-
tricities of the hypothetical trajectory. Thus, emleb = (41 - 
1Ay)/(-14 - y) =
+0.0625/-0.125O; y = 34 in (863.6 mm); ea = 0;em = +24 in (609.6 mm); eb = -48 in
(-1219.2 mm); C1 = - 48 (+0.0550)/-0.1250 = +21.12 in (536.448 mm); e2 = +26.88 in
(682.752 mm); ez = + 17.28 in (438.912 mm); e4 = -7.68 in (-195.072 mm).

17. Evaluate F1 by substituting in relation (b') of step 7

Thus, Ft = 2509(14,860)/(10.32 + 26.88) = 1,000,000 Ib (4448 kN). Hence, the introduc-
tion of nonprestressed reinforcement served to reduce the prestressing force by 14 per-
cent.

18. Calculate the prestresses at every boundary section; then find
the stresses at transfer and under design load

Record the results in Table 5. (At sections 1 through 4, the final stresses were determined
by applying the values on lines 5 and 8 in Table 4. The slight discrepancy between the fi-

nal stress at 2 and the allowable value o f —60 lb/in2 (-413.7 kPa) arises from the degree of
precision in the calculations.)
With the exception offbi at B, all stresses at the boundary sections lie within the allow-
able range.

19. Locate the section at which fbl = -60 lb/in2 (-413.7 kPa)

Since fbp andfbw vary parabolically across the span, their sum fbi also varies in this man-
ner. Let x denote the distance from the interior support to a given section. Apply Eq. 66 to
find the equation for fbi using the initial-stress values at sections B9 3, and 1. Or, -355 - 2
x 1072 + 1157 = -1342 (-9253.1 kPa); 3(-355) - 4(1072) + 1157 = -4196 (-28,931.4
kPa);/w = -2684(jt/96)2 + 4196*/96 - 355. When/6l = -60 (-413.7), x = 7.08 ft (2.15 m).
The tensile stress at transfer is therefore excessive in an interval of only 14 .16ft (4.32 m).

20. Design the nonprestressed reinforcement over the
interior support

As in the preceding procedures, the member must be investigated for ultimate-strength
capacity. The calculation pertaining to any quantity that varies parabolically across the
span may be readily checked by verifying that the values at uniformly spaced sections
have equal "second differences." For example, with respect to the values of/j,/ recorded in
Table 5, the verification is:

REACTIONS FOR A CONTINUOUS BEAM

With reference to the beam in the previous calculation procedure, compute the reactions
at the supports caused by the initial prestressing force designed in part a.

Calculation Procedure:

1. Determine what causes the reactions at the supports

As shown in Fig. 51, the reactions at the supports result from the continuity at B, and R0 =
Mkb/L

2. Compute the continuity moment at B; then find the reactions

Thus, Mp = -F1C +Mk = -F1-^00n; Mk = Ft(e - econ) = 1160(-14 + 39.05) = 29,060 in-kips
(3283 kN-m). R0 = 29,060/[120(12)] = 20.2 kips (89.8 kN); RB = -40.4 kips (-179.8 kN).

STEEL BEAM ENCASED IN CONCRETE

A concrete floor slab is to be supported by steel beams spaced 10 ft (3.05 m) on centers
and having a span of 28 ft 6 in (8.69 m). The beams will be encased in concrete with a
minimum cover of 2 in (50.8 mm) all around; they will remain unshored during construc-
tion. The slab has been designed as 41X2 in (114.3 mm) thick, with// = 3000 lb/in2 (20.7
MPa). The loading includes the following: live load, 120 lb/ft2 (5.75 kPa); finished floor
and ceiling, 25 lb/ft2 (1.2 kPa). The steel beams have been tentatively designed as Wl 6 *
40. Review the design.

Calculation Procedure:

1. Record the relevant properties of the section and the allowable
flexural stresses

In accordance with the AISC Specification, the member may be designed as a composite
steel-and-concrete beam, reliance being placed on the natural bond of the two materials to
obtain composite action. Refer to Sec. 1 for the design of a composite bridge member. In
the design of a composite building member, the effects of plastic flow are usually disre-
garded. Since the slab is poured monolithically, the composite member is considered con-
tinuous. Apply the following equations in computing bending moments in the composite
beams: at midspan, M= (1Ao)WL2; at support, M= (Vi2)wL2.
The subscripts c, ts, and bs refer to the extreme fiber of concrete, top of steel, and bot-
tom of steel, respectively. The superscripts c and n refer to the composite and noncom-
posite sections, respectively.
Record the properties of the W16 x 40: A = 11.77 in2 (75.94 cm2); d = 16.00 in (406.4
mm); /= 515.5 in4 (21.457 cm4); S = 64.4 in3 (1055.3 cm3); flange width = 7 in (177.8
mm). By the AISC Specification, fs = 24,000 lb/in2 (165.5 MPa). By the ACI Code, n = 9
and/c = 1350 lb/in2 (9306.9 kPa).

2. Transform the composite section in the region of positive
moment to an equivalent section of steel; compute the
section moduli

Refer to Fig. 58a and the AISC Specification. Use the gross concrete area. Then the effec-

(b) Section for negative moment

negative moment.

tive flange width = 1X4L = !/4(28.5)12 = 85.5 in (2172 mm); spacing of beams = 120 in
(3048 mm); I6t + 11 = 16(4.5) + 11 = 83 in (2108 mm); this governs. Transformed width
= 83/9 = 9.22 in (234.2 mm).
Assume that the neutral axis lies within the flange, and take static moments with re-
spect to this axis; or 1/2(9.22y2) - 11.77(10 -y) = O; y = 3.93 in (99.8 mm).
Compute the moment of inertia. Slab: C/3)9.22(3.93)3 = 187 in4 (7783.5 cm4). Beam:
515.5 + 11.77 x (10-3.93)2 = 949 in4 (39,500.4 cm4); I= 187 + 949 = 1136 in4 (47,283.9
cm4); Sc = 1136/3.93 = 289.1 in3 (4737.5 cm3); Sbs = 1136/14.07 = 80.7 in3 (1322.4 cm3).

3. Transform the composite section in the region of negative
moment to an equivalent section of steel; compute the
section moduli

Referring to Fig. 58&, we see that the transformed width = 11/9 = 1.22 in (31.0 mm). Take
static moments with respect to the neutral axis. Or, 11.77(10 - y) - 1X2(1.22^2) = O; y =
7.26 in (184.4 mm). Compute the moment of inertia. Thus, slab: (1X3) 1.22(7.26)3 = 155.6
in4 (6476.6 cm4). Beam: 515.5 + 11.77(10 - 7.26)2 = 603.9 in4 (25,136.2 cm4);'/= 155.6
+ 603.9 = 759.5 in4 (31,612.8 cm4). Then Sc = 759.5/7.26 - 104.6 in3 (1714.1 cm3); Sts =
759.5/10.74 - 70.7 in3 (1158.6 cm3).

4. Compute the bending stresses at midspan

The loads carried by the noncomposite member are: slab, (4.5)150(10)/12 = 563 Ib/lin ft
(8.22 kN/m); stem, 11(15.5)150/144 = 178 Ib/lin ft (2.6 kN/m); steel, 40 Ib/lin ft (0.58
kN/m); total = 563 + 178 + 40 = 781 Ib/lin ft (11.4 kN/m). The load carried by the com-
posite member = 145(10) = 1450 Ib/lin ft (21.2 kN/m). Then Mn = (1Xs)781(28.5)212 =
951,500 in-lb (107.5 kN-m); Mc = (Y2o)1450(28.5)212 = 706,600 in-lb (79.8 kN-m);/c =
706,600/[289.1(9)] = 272 lb/in2 (1875 kPa), which is acceptable. Also, fbs =
(951,500/64.4) + (706,600/80.7) = 23,530 lb/in2 (162.2 MPa), which is acceptable.

5. Compute the bending stresses at the support

Thus, Mc = 706,600(20Xi2) = 1,177,700 in-lb (132.9 kN-m);/c = l,177,700/[ 104.6(9)] =
1251 
lb/in2 (8.62 MPa), which is satisfactory. Also,/, = 1,177,700/70.7 = 16,60.0 lb/in2
(114.9 MPa), which is acceptable. The design is therefore satisfactory with respect to
flexure.

6. Investigate the composite member with respect to horizontal
shear in the concrete at the section of contraflexure

Assume that this section lies at a distance of 0.2L from the support. The shear at this sec-
tion is Vc = 1450(0.3)(28.5) = 12,400 Ib (55.2 kN).

Refer to Sec. 1. Where the bending moment is positive, the critical plane for horizon-
tal shear is considered to be the surface abed in Fig. 59a. For simplicity, however, com-
pute the shear flow at the neutral axis. Apply the relation q = VQII, where Q =
1/2(9.22)(3.93)2 = 71.20 in3 (1166.8 cm3) and q = 12,400(71.20)71136 = 777 Ib/lin in (136
N/mm).
Resistance to shear flow is provided by the bond between the steel and concrete along
be and by the pure-shear strength of the concrete along ab and cd. (The term pure shear is
used to distinguish this from shear that is used as a measure of diagonal tension.) The al-
lowable stresses in bond and pure shear are usually taken as 0.03// and 0.12/', respec-
tively. Thus be = 1 in (177.8 mm); ab = (2.52 + 22)0-5 = 3.2 in (81.3 mm); qallow = 7(90) +
2(3.2)360 = 2934 Ib/lin in (419 N/mm), which is satisfactory.

7. Investigate the composite member with respect to horizontal
shear in the concrete at the support

The critical plane for horizontal shear is efin Fig. 596. Thus Vc = 1450(0.5)28.5 = 20,660
Ib (91.9 kN); Q = 1.22(2)(7.26 - 1) = 15.27 in3 (250.2 cm3); q = 20,660(15.27)7759.5 =
415 Ib/lin in (72.7 N/mm); #allow = 7(90) + 2(2)360 = 2070 Ib/lin in (363 N/mm), which is
satisfactory.
Mechanical shear connectors are not required to obtain composite action, but the beam
is wrapped with wire mesh.

COMPOSITE STEEL-AND-CONCRETE BEAM

A concrete floor slab is to be supported by steel beams spaced lift (3.35 m) on centers and
having a span of 36 ft (10.97 m). The beams will be supplied with shear connectors to ob-
tain composite action of the steel and concrete. The slab will be 5 in (127 mm) thick and
made of 3000-lb/in2 (20.7-MPa) concrete. Loading includes the following: live load, 200
lb/ft2 (9.58 kPa); finished floor, ceiling, and partition, 30 lb/ft2 (1.44 kPa). In addition,
each girder will carry a dead load of 10 kips (44.5 kN) applied as a concentrated load at
midspan prior to hardening of the concrete. Conditions at the job site preclude the use of
temporary shoring. Design the interior girders, limiting the overall depth of steel to 20 in
(508 mm), if possible.

FIGURE 59. Critical planes for horizontal shear.

Calculation Procedure:

1. Compute the unit loads W1, W2, and W3

Refer to the AISC Specification and Manual. Although ostensibly we apply the elastic-
stress method, the design of a composite steel-and-concrete beam in reality is based on
the ultimate-strength behavior of the member. Loads that are present before the concrete
has hardened are supported by the steel member alone; loads that are present after the
concrete has hardened are considered to be supported by the composite member, regard-
less of whether these loads originated before or after hardening. The effects of plastic
flow are disregarded.
The subscripts 1, 2, and 3 refer, respectively, to dead loads applied before hardening
of the concrete, dead loads applied after hardening of the concrete, and live loads. The
subscripts b, ts, and tc refer to the bottom of the member, top of the steel, and top of the
concrete, respectively. The superscripts c and n refer to the composite and noncomposite
member, respectively.
We compute the unit loads for a slab weight of 63 Ib/lin ft (0.92 kN/m) and an as-
sumed steel weight of 80 Ib/lin ft (1167.5 N/m): W1 = 63(11) + 80 = 773 Ib/lin ft (11.3
kN/m); W2 = 30(11) = 330 Ib/lin ft (4.8 kN/m); W3 = 200(11) = 2200 Ib/lin ft (32.1 kN/m).

2. Compute all bending moments required in the design

Thus, M1 = 12[(%)0.773(36)2 + '/4(10)36] = 2583 in-kips (291.8 kN-m); M2 =
0/8)0.330(36)212 = 642 in-kips (72.5 kN-m). M3 = (%)2.200(36)212 = 4277 in-kips (483.2
kN-m); Mc = 2583 + 642 + 4277 = 7502 in-kips (847.6 kN-m); M* = 2583 in-kips (291.8
kN-m); MDL = 2583 + 642 = 3225 in-kips (364.4 kN-m); M1x = 4277 in-kips (483.2
kN-m).

3. Compute the required section moduli with respect to the steel,
using an allowable bending stress of 24 kips/in2 (165.5 MPa)

In the composite member, the maximum steel stress occurs at the bottom; in the noncom-
posite member, it occurs at the top of the steel if a bottom-flange cover plate is used.
Thus, composite section, Sb = 7502/24 = 312.6 in3 (5122.6 cm3); noncomposite sec-
tion, Sts = 2583/24 = 107.6 in3 (1763.3 cm3).

4. Select a trial section by tentatively assuming that the
composite-design tables in the AISC Manual are applicable

The Manual shows that a composite section consisting of a 5-in (127-mm) concrete slab,
a Wl 8 x 55 steel beam, and a cover plate having an area of 9 in2 (58.1 cm2) provides Sb =
317.5 in3 (5202.9 cm3). The noncomposite section provides Sts = 113.7 in3 (1863.2 cm3).
Since unshored construction is to be used, the section must conform with the Manual
equation 1.35 + 0.35MLL/MDL = 1.35 + 0.35(4277/3225) = 1.81. AndSg/Sff = 317.5/213.6
= 1.49, which is satisfactory.
The flange width of the W18 x 55 is 7.53 in (191.3 mm). The minimum allowable dis-
tance between the edge of the cover plate and the edge of the beam flange equals the size
of the fillet weld plus 5/i6 in (7.9 mm). Use a 9 x 1 in (229 x 25 mm) plate. The steel sec-
tion therefore coincides with that presented in the AISC Manual, which has a cover plate
thickness tp of 1 in (25.4 mm). The trial section is therefore Wl 8 x 55; cover plate is 9 x 1
in (229 x 25 mm).

5. Check the trial section

The AISC composite-design tables are constructed by assuming that the effective flange
width of the member equals 16 times the slab thickness plus the flange width of the steel.
In the present instance, the effective flange width, as governed by the AISC, is 1AL =
!/4(36)12 = 108 in (2743 mm); spacing of beams = 132 in (3353 mm); 16/ + 7.53 = 16(5) +
7.53 = 87.53 in (2223.3 mm), which governs.

The cross section properties in the AISC table may be applied. The moment of inertia
refers to an equivalent section obtained by transforming the concrete to steel. Refer to
Sec. 1. Thus yte = 5 + 18.12 + 1 - 16.50 = 7.62 in (194 mm); Ste = Ilytc = 5242/7.62 =
687.9 in3 (11,272.7 cm3). From the ACI Code J0 = 1350 lb/in2 (9.31 MPa) and n = 9.
Then/c = Mcl(nStc) = 7,502,000/[9(687.9)] = 1210 lb/in2 (8.34 MPa), which is satisfacto-
ry-

6. Record the relevant properties of the 1/1/18 x 55

Thus, A = 16.19 in2 (104.5 cm2); d = 18.12 in (460 mm); /= 890 in4 (37,044.6 cm4); S =
98.2 in3 (1609 cm3); flange thickness = 0.630 in (16.0 mm).

7. Compute the section moduli of the composite section where
the cover plate is absent

To locate the neutral axis, take static moments with respect to the center of the steel.
Thus, transformed flange width = 87.53/9 = 9.726 in (247.0 mm). Further,

Then y = 562.2/64.82 = 8.67 in (220 mm); /= 6499 + 991 - 64.82(8.67)2 = 2618 in4
(108,969.4 cm4); yb = 9.06 + 8.67 = 17.73 in (450 mm); ytc = 9.06 + 5 - 8.67 = 5.39 in
(136.9 mm); Sb = 2618/17.73 = 147.7 in3 (2420 cm3); Stc = 2618/5.39 = 485.7 in3 (7959
cm3).

8. Verify the value of Sb

Apply the value of the K factor in the AISC table. This factor is defined by K2 = 1 - Sb
without plate/Si, with plate. The Sb value without the plate = 317.5(1 - 0.732) = 148 in3
(2425 cm3), which is satisfactory.

9. Establish the theoretical length of the cover plate

In Fig. 60, let C denote the section at which the cover plate becomes superfluous with re-
spect to flexure. Then, for the composite section, w = 0.773 + 0.330 + 2.200 = 3.303
kips/lin ft (48.2 kN/m); P = IO kips (44.5 kN); Mm = 7502 in-kips (847.6 kN-m); R0 =
64.45 kips (286.7 kN). The allowable values of M0 are, for concrete, Mc =
485.7(9)1.35/12 = 491.8 ft-kips (666.9 kN-m) and, for steel, Mc = 147.7(24)712 = 295.4
ft-kips (400.6 kN-m), which governs. Then RJC - l/2\vx2 = 295A; x = 5.30 ft (1.62 m). The
theoretical length = 36 - 2(5.30) = 25.40 ft (7.74 m).
For the noncomposite section, investigate the stresses at the section C previously lo-
cated. Thus: w = 0.773 kips/lin ft (11.3 kN/m); P=IQ kips (44.5 kN); R0 = 18.91 kips
(84.1 kN); Mc = 18.91(5.30) - '/2(0.773) x 5.302 = 89.4 ft-kips (121.2 kN-m);/6 = -
89.4(12)798.2 = 10.9 kips/in2 (75.1 MPa), which is satisfactory.

10. Determine the axial force F in the cover plate at its end by
computing the mean bending stress

Thus/mean = Mymean/I= 295.4(12)916.50) - 0.50)/5242 = 10.82 kips/in2 (75.6 MPa); F =
AfmQan = 9(10.82) = 97.4 kips (433.2 kN). Alternatively, calculate Fby applying the factor
120/7 recorded in the AISC table. Thus, F = UQMII = 0.33(295.4) = 97.5 kips (433.7
kN).

11. Design the weld required
to develop the cover plate
at each end

Use fillet welds of E60 electrodes, placed
along the sides but not along the end of the
plate. The AISC Specification 
requires a
minimum weld of 5/ie in (7.9 mm) for a 1-in
(25.4-mm) plate; the capacity of this weld is
3000 Ib/lin in (525 N/mm). Then, length =
97,400/3000 = 32.5 in (826 mm). However,
the AISC requires that the plate be extended
18 in (457 mm) beyond the theoretical cut-
off point, thus providing 36 in (914 mm) of
weld at each end. 

12. Design the intermittent weld

(a) Load diagram

, 
(b) Bending-moment diagram

%

FIGURE 60. (a) Load diagram; (b) bend-
ing-moment diagram.

The vertical shear at C is V0 = R0 - 5.3Ow = 
64.45 - 5.30(3.303) = 46.94 kips (208.8 
kN); q = VQII = 46,940(0.33)712 = 1290
Ib/lin in (225.9 N/mm). The AISC calls for a
minimum weld length of I1A in (3.81 mm).
Let s denote the center-to-center spacing. Then s = 2(1.5)3000/1290 = 7.0 in (177.8 mm).
The AISC imposes an upper limit of 24 times the thickness of the thinner part joined, or
12 in (304.8 mm). Thus, 5max = 24(0.63) > 12 in (304.8 mm). Use a 7-in (177.8-mm) spac-
ing at the ends and increase the spacing as the shear diminishes.

13. Design the shear connectors

Use %-in (19.1-mm) studs, 3 in (76.2 mm) high. The design of the connectors is governed
by the AISC Specification. The capacity of the stud = 11.5 kips (51.2 kN). From the AISC
table, Vh = 453.4 kips (2016.7 kN). Total number of studs required - 2(453.4)/! 1.5 = 80.
These are to be equally spaced.

DESIGN OF A CONCRETE JOIST
IN A RIBBED FLOOR

The concrete floor of a building will be constructed by using removable steel pans to form
a one-way ribbed slab. The loads are: live load, 80 lb/ft2 (3.83 kPa); allowance for mov-
able partitions, 20 lb/ft2 (0.96 kPa); plastered ceiling, 10 lb/ft2 (0.48 kPa); wood floor
with sleepers in cinder-concrete fill, 15 lb/ft2 (0.72 kPa). The joists will have a clear span
of 17 ft (5.2 m) and be continuous over several spans. Design the interior joist by the ulti-
mate-strength method, using// = 3000 lb/in2 (20.7 MPa) mdfy - 40,000 lb/in2 (275.8
MPa).

Calculation Procedure:

1. Compute the ultimate load carried by the joist

A one-way ribbed floor consists of a concrete slab supported by closely spaced members
called ribs, or joists. The joists in turn are supported by steel or concrete girders that
frame to columns. Manufacturers' engineering data present the dimensions of steel-pan
forms that are available and the average weight of floor corresponding to each form.

FIGURE 61. Ribbed floor.

Try the cross section shown in Fig. 61, which has an average weight of 54 lb/ft2 (2.59
kPa). Although the forms are tapered to facilitate removal, assume for design purposes
that the joist has a constant width of 5 in (127 mm). The design of a ribbed floor is gov-
erned by the ACI Code. The ultimate-strength design of reinforced-concrete members is
covered in Sec. 1.
Referring to the ACI Code, compute the ultimate load carried by the joist. Or, wu =
2.08[1.5(54 + 20 + 10 + 15) + 1.8(8O)] = 608 Ib/lin ft (8.9 kN/m).

2. Determine whether the joist is adequate with respect to shear

Since the joist is too narrow to permit the use of stirrups, the shearing stress must be lim-
ited to the value given in the ACI Code. Or, vc = 1.1(2<£)(/C')(2<£)05 = 1.1(2)(0.85)
(3000)°5 = 102 lb/in2 (703.2 kPa).
Assume that the reinforcement will consist of no. 4 bars. With % in (19.1 mm) for fire-
proofing, as required by the ACI Code, d = 8 + 2.5 - 1.0 = 9.5 in (241.3 mm). The vertical
shear at a distance d from the face of the support is Vu = (8.5 - 0.79)608 = 4690 Ib (20.9
kN).
The critical shearing stress computed as required by the ACI Code is vu = VJ(bd) =
4690/[5(9.5)] = 99 lb/in2 (682.6 kPa) < vc, which is satisfactory.

3. Compute the ultimate moments to be resisted by the joist

Do this by applying the moment equations given in the ACI Code. Or, MMpos =
(>/i6)608(17)212 = 132,000 in-lb (14.9 kN-m); MMneg = (1Xii)608( 17)212 = 192,000 in-lb
(21.7 kN-m).
Where the bending moment is positive, the fibers above the neutral axis are in com-
pression, and the joist and tributary slab function in combination to form a T beam.
Where the bending moment is negative, the joist functions alone.

4. Determine whether the joist is capable of resisting the negative
moment

Use the equation #max = 0.6375^87,000/(87,0OO + fy), or qmax = 0.6375(0.85)
87,000/127,000 - 0.371. By Eq. 6 of Sec. 1, M14 = <l>b(Pfc'q(l 
- 0.590), or Mu =
0.90(5)9.52 x (3000)0.371(0.781) = 353,000 in-lb (39.9 kN-m), which is satisfactory.

5. Compute the area of negative reinforcement

Use Eq. 7 of Sec. 1. Or,/c = 0.85(3) = 2.55 kips/in2 (17.6 MPa); bdfc = 5(9.5)2.55 = 121.1;
2bfcMu/<f> = 2(5)2.55(192)/0.90 = 5440; A5 = [121.1 - (121.12 - 5440)05]/40 = 0.63 in2
(4.06 cm2).

6. Compute the area of positive reinforcement

Since the stress block lies wholly within the flange, apply Eq. 7 of Sec. 1, with b = 25 in
(635 mm). Or, bdfc = 605.6; 2bfcMul(f> = 18,700; A3 = [605.6 - (605.62 - 18,700)° 5]/40 =
0.39 in2 (2.52 cm2).

7. Select the reinforcing bars and locate the bend points

For positive reinforcement, use two no. 4 bars, one straight and one trussed, to obtain As =

0.40 in2 (2.58 cm2). For negative reinforcement, supplement the two trussed bars over the
support with one straight no. 5 bar to obtain A5 = 0.71 in2 (4.58 cm2).
To locate the bend points of the trussed bars and to investigate the bond stress, follow
the method given in Sec. 1.

DESIGN OFA STAIR SLAB

The concrete stair shown in elevation in Fig. 62<z, which has been proportioned in con-
formity with the requirements of the local building code, is to carry a live load of 100
lb/ft2 (4.79 kPa). The slab will be poured independently of the supporting members. De-

sign the slab by the working-stress method, using fc' = 3000 lb/in2 (20.7 MPa) and fs =
20,000 lb/in2 (137.9 MPa).

Calculation Procedure:

1. Compute the unit loads

The working-stress method of designing reinforced-concrete members is presented in
Sec. 1. The slab is designed as a simply supported beam having a span equal to the hori-
zontal distance between the center of supports. For convenience, consider a strip of slab
having a width of 1 ft (0.3 m).
Assume that the slab will be 5.5 in (139 mm) thick, the thickness of the stairway slab
being measured normal to the soffit. Compute the average vertical depth in Fig. 62b. Thus
sec B = 1.25; h = 5.5(1.25) + 3.75 = 10.63 in (270.0 mm). For the stairway, w = 100 +
10.63(150)712 = 233 Ib/lin ft (3.4-kN/m); for the landing, w = 100 + 5.5(150)712 = 169
Ib/lin ft (2.5 kN/m).

2. Compute the maximum bending moment In the slab

Construct the load diagram shown in Fig. 62c, adding about 5 in (127 mm) to the clear
span to obtain the effective span. Thus R0 = [169(4.2)2.1 + 233(7.7)8.05]/! 1.9 = 1339 Ib
(5.95 kN); x = 1339/233 = 5.75 ft (1.75 m); Mmax = 1^ 1339)5.75(12) = 46,200 in-lb (5.2
kN-m).

3. Design the reinforcement

Refer to Table 1 to obtain the following values: Kb = 223 lb/in2 (1.5 MPa);y = 0.874. As-
sume an effective depth of 4.5 in (114.3 mm). By Eq. 31, the moment capacity of the
member at balanced design is Mb = Kbbcf = 223(12)4.52 = 54,190 in-lb (6.1 kN-m). The
steel is therefore stressed to capacity. (Upon investigation, a 5-in (127-mm) slab is found
to be inadequate.) By Eq. 25, A8 = Mt(JJd) = 46,200/[20,000(0.874)4.5] = 0.587 in2 (3.79
cm2).
Use no. 5 bars, 6 in (152.4 mm) on centers, to obtain A8 — 0.62 in2 (4.0 cm2). In addi-
tion, place one no. 5 bar transversely under each tread to assist in distributing the load and
to serve as temperature reinforcement. Since the slab is poured independently of the sup-
porting members, it is necessary to furnish dowels at the construction joints.

FREE VIBRATORYMOTION OFA RIGID BENT

The bent in Fig. 63 is subjected to a horizontal load P applied suddenly at the top. Using
literal values, determine the frequency of vibration of the bent. Make these simplifying
assumptions: The girder is infinitely rigid; the columns have negligible mass; damping
forces are absent.

Calculation Procedure:

1. Compute the spring constant

The amplitude (maximum horizontal displacement of the bent from its position of static
equilibrium) is a function of the energy imparted to the bent by the applied load. The fre-
quency of vibration is independent of this energy. To determine the frequency, it is neces-
sary to find the spring constant of the vibrating system. This is the static force that is re-

FIGURE 63. Vibrating bent.

quired at the top to cause a horizontal displacement of one unit. Since the girder is consid-
ered to be infinitely rigid, the elastic curves of the columns are vertical at the top. Let/=
frequency; k = spring constant; M= total mass of girder and bodies supported by girder.
Using cases 22 and 23 in the AISC Manual, we see that when A = 1, the horizontal re-
actions are R1 = UEI1IL3; R2 = 3E(1.3/0/(1.2I)3 - 2.26EI1IL3 k = R1 + R2 = 14.26EI1IL3.

2. Compute the frequency of vibration

Use the equation/= (\l27r)(k/M)0-5 = (1/2^(14.26EI1IML3)05 = 0.6Ql(EI1IML3)05 Hz.

In designing timber members, the following references are often used: Wood Handbook,
Forest Products Laboratory, U.S. Department of Agriculture, and National Design Speci-
fication for Stress-Grade Lumber and Its Fastenings, National Forest Products Associa-
tion. The members are assumed to be continuously dry and subject to normal loading con-
ditions.
For most species of lumber, the true or dressed dimensions are less than the nominal
dimensions by the following amounts: 3A in (9.53 mm) for dimensions less than 6 in
(152.4 mm); l/2 in (12.7 mm) for dimensions of 6 in (152.4 mm) or more. The average
weight of timber is 40 lb/ft3 (6.28 kN/m3). The width and depth of the transverse section
are denoted by b and d, respectively.

BENDING STRESS AND DEFLECTION
OF WOOD JOISTS

A floor is supported by 3 x 8 in (76.2 x 203.2 mm) wood joists spaced 16 in (406.4 mm)
on centers with an effective span of 10 ft (3.0 m). The total floor load transmitted to the
joists is 107 lb/in2 (5.123 kN/m2). Compute the maximum bending stress and initial de-
flection, using E = 1,760,000 lb/in2 (12,135 kPa).

Calculation Procedure:

1. Calculate the beam properties or extract them from a table

Thus, A = 25A(IV2) = 19.7 in2 (12.7.10 cm2); beam weight = (.4/144) (lumber density,
lb/ft3) = (19.7/144)(40) - 5 Ib/lin ft (73.0 N/m); /= (1/12)(25/8)(7Y2)3 = 92.3 in4 (3841.81
cm4); S= 92.3/3.75 = 24.6 in3 (403.19 cm3).

2. Compute the unit load carried by the joists

Thus, the unit load w = 107(1.33) + 5 = 148 Ib/lin ft (2159.9 N/m), where the factor 1.33
is the width, ft, of the floor load carried by each joist and 5 = the beam weight, Ib/lin ft.

3. Compute the maximum bending stress in the joist

Thus, the bending moment in the joist is M = (l/8)wZ,212, where M = bending moment,
in-lb (N-m); L = joist length, ft (m). Substituting gives M= (1/8)(148)(10)2(12) = 22,200
in-lb (2508.2 N-m). Then for the stress in the beam,/= M/S, where/= stress, lb/in2 (kPa),
and S = beam section modulus, in3 (cm3); or/= 22,200/24.6 = 902 lb/in2 (6219.3 kPa).

4. Compute the Initial deflection at midspan

Using the AISC Manual deflection equation, we see that the deflection A in (mm) =
(5/384)wL4/(E7), where /= section moment of inertia, in4 (cm4) and other symbols are as
before. Substituting yields A = 5(148)(10)4(1728)/[384(1,760,000)(92.3)] = 0.205 in
(5.2070 mm). In this relation, the factor 1728 converts cubic feet to cubic inches.

SHEARING STRESS CAUSED BY
STATIONARY CONCENTRATED LOAD

A 3 x 10 in (76.2 x 254.0 mm) beam on a span of 12 ft (3.7 m) carries a concentrated load
of 2730 Ib (12,143.0 N) located 2 ft (0.6 m) from the support. If the allowable shearing
stress is 120 lb/in2 (827.4 kPa), determine whether this load is excessive. Neglect the
beam weight.

Calculation Procedure:

1. Calculate the reaction at the adjacent support

In a rectangular section, the shearing stress varies parabolically with the depth and has the
maximum value of v = 1.5V/A, where F= shear, Ib (N).
The Wood Handbook notes that checks are sometimes present near the neutral axis of
timber beams. The vitiating effect of these checks is recognized in establishing the allow-
able shearing stresses. However, these checks also have a beneficial effect, for they mod-
ify the shear distribution and thereby reduce the maximum stress. The amount of this re-
duction depends on the position of the load. The maximum shearing stress to be applied

in design is given by v = \Q(a/d)2vY{9[2 + (a/d)2]}, where v = true maximum shearing
stress, IMn2 (kPa); v' = nominal maximum stress computed from 1.5V/A; a = distance
from load to adjacent support, in (mm).
Computing the reaction R at the adjacent support gives R = Fmax = 2730(12 - 2)712 =
2275 Ib (10,119.2 N). Then v' = 1.5V/A - 1.5(2275)724.9 = 137 lb/in2 (944.6 kPa).

2. Find the design stress

Using the equation given in step 1, we get (aid)2 = (24/9.5)2 = 6.38; v = 10(6.38)( 137)/
[9(8.38)] = 116 lb/in2 (799.8 kPa) < 120 lb/in2 (827.4 kPa). The load is therefore not ex-
cessive.

A4 x 12 in (101.6 x 304.8 mm) beam on a span of 10 ft (3.0 m) carries a total uniform
load of 150 Ib/lin ft (2189.1 N/m) and a moving concentrated load. If the allowable shear-
ing stress is 130 lb/in2 (896.4 kPa), what is the allowable value of the moving load as gov-
erned by shear?

Calculation Procedure:
1. Calculate the reaction at the support

The transient load induces the absolute maximum shearing stress when it lies at a certain
critical distance from the support rather than directly above it. This condition results from
the fact that as the load recedes from the support, the reaction decreases but the shear-
redistribution effect becomes less pronounced. The approximate method of analysis rec-
ommended in the Wood Handbook affords an expedient means of finding the moving-
load capacity.
Place the moving load P at a distance of 3d or 1AL from the support, whichever is less.
Calculate the reaction at the support, disregarding the load within a distance of d there-
from.
Thus, 3d = 2.9 ft (0.884 m) and 1AL = 2.5 ft (0.762 m); then R = Fmax = 150(5 - 0.96)
+ 3AP = 610 + V4P.

2. Calculate the allowable shear

Thus, Fallow = 2AvA = 2/3(130)(41.7) = 3610 Ib (16,057.3 N). Then 610 + 3AP = 3610; P =
4000 Ib (17,792.0 N).

STRENGTH OF DEEP WOODEN BEAMS

If the allowable bending stress in a shallow beam is 1500 lb/in2 (10,342.5 kPa), what is
the allowable bending moment in a 12 x 20 in (304.8 x 508.0 mm) beam?

Calculation Procedure:
1. Calculate the depth factor F

An increase in depth of a rectangular beam is accompanied by a decrease in the modulus

of rupture. For beams more than 16 in (406.4 mm) deep, it is necessary to allow for this
reduction in strength by introducing a depth factor F.
Thus, F= 0.81 (d2 + 143)/(</2 + 88), where d = dressed depth of beam, in. Substituting
gives F= 0.81(19.52 + 143)/(19.52 + 88) = 0.905.

2. Apply the result of step 1 to obtain the moment capacity

Use the relation M = FfS9 where the symbols are as given earlier. Thus, M = 0.905 x
(1.5)(728.8)/12 = 82.4 ft-kips (111.73 kN-m).

DESIGN OFA WOOD-PLYWOOD BEAM

A girder having a 36-ft (11.0-m) span is to carry a uniform load of 550 Ib/lin ft (8026.6
N/m), which includes its estimated weight. Design a box-type member of glued construc-
tion, using the allowable stresses given in the table. The modulus of elasticity of both ma-
terials is 1,760,000 lb/in2 (12,135.2 MPa), and the ratio of deflection to span cannot ex-
ceed 1/360. Architectural details limit the member depth to 40 in (101.6 cm).

*Use 36 lb/in2 (248.2 kPa) at contact surface of flange and web to allow for stress concentration.

Calculation Procedure:
1. Compute the maximum shear and bending moment

Thus, V = 1/2(550)(36) = 9900 Ib (44,035.2 N); M = 1A(WL2)^ = 1/8(550)(36)212 =
1,070,000 in-lb (120,888.6 N-m). To preclude the possibility of field error, make the ten-
sion and compression flanges alike.

2. Calculate the beam depth for a balanced condition

Assume that the member precisely satisfies the requirements for flexure and deflection,
and calculate the depth associated with this balanced condition. To allow for the deflec-
tion caused by shear, which is substantial when a thin web is used, increase the deflection
as computed in the conventional manner by one-half. Thus, M =fllc = 2fl/d = 27007/c/,
Eq. 0 .A = (1.5/4S)L2Mf(EI) = £/360, Eq. b.
Substitute in Eq. b the value of M given by Eq. a; solve for d to obtain d = 37.3 in
(947.42 mm). Use the permissible depth of 40 in (1016.0 mm). As a result of this increase
in depth, a section that satisfies the requirement for flexure will satisfy the requirement
for deflection as well.

3. Design the flanges

Approximate the required area of the compression flange; design the flanges. For this pur-
pose, assume that the flanges will be 51A in (139.7 mm) deep. The lever arm of the result-
ant forces in the flanges will be 34.8 in (883.92 mm), and the average fiber stress will be
1165 lb/in2 (8032.7 kPa). Then A = l,070,000/[ 1165(34.8)] = 26.4 in2 (170.33 cm2). Use
three 2 x 6 in (50.8 x 152.4 mm) sections with glued vertical laminations for both the ten-

FIGURE 1

sion and compression flange. Then A = 3(8.93) = 26.79 in2 (170.268 cm2); I0 = 3(22.5) =
67.5 in4 (2809.56 cm4).

4. Design the webs

Use the approximation tw = Vldvn = 1.25(9900)/[40(192)] = 1.61 in (40.894 mm). Try
two 7/s-in (22.2-mm) thick plywood webs. A catalog of plywood properties reveals that
the 7/8-in (22.2mm) member consists of seven plies and that the parallel plies have an ag-
gregate thickness of 0.5 in (12.7 mm). Draw the trial section as shown in Fig. 1.

5. Check the bending stress in the member

For simplicity, disregard the webs in evaluating the moment of inertia. Thus, the moment
of inertia of the flanges 7^= 2(67.5 + 26.79 x 17.252) = 16,080 in4 (669,299.448 cm4);
then the stress/= McII= 1,070,000(20)716,080 = 1330 < 1350 lb/in2 (9308.25 kPa). This
is acceptable.

6. Check the shearing stress at the contact surface of the flange
and web

Use the relation Qf=Ad = 26.79(17.25) = 462 in3 (7572.2 cm2). The q per surface =
VQf f(2If) = 9900(462)/[2(16,080)] = 142 Ib/lin in (24.8 kN/m). Assume that the shearing
stress is uniform across the surface, and apply 36 lb/in2 (248.2 kPa), as noted earlier, as
the allowable stress. Then, v = 142/5.5 = 26 lb/in2 (179.3 kPa) < 36 lb/in2 (248.2 kPa).
This is acceptable.

7. Check the shearing stress in the webs

For this purpose, include the webs in evaluating the moment of inertia but apply solely
the area of the parallel plies. At the neutral axis Q = Qf+ Qw = 462 + 2(0.5)(20)(10) =
662 in3 (10,850.2 cm3); / - If+ Iw = 16,080 + 2(1/12)(0.5)(40)3 = 21,410 in4 (89.115
dm4). Then v = VQI(If) = 9900(662)/[21,410(2)(0.875)] = 175 lb/in2 (1206.6 kPa) < 192
lb/in2 (1323.8 kPa). This is acceptable.

8. Check the deflection^ applying the moment of inertia of only
the flanges

Thus, A = (7.5/384)wL4/(£7/) = 7.5(550)(36)4(1728)/[384(1,760,00O)(16,08O)] = 1.10 in
(27.94 mm); ML = 1.10/[36(12)] < 1/360. This is acceptable, and the trial section is there-
fore satisfactory in all respects.

9. Establish the allowable spacing of the bridging

To do this, compare the moments of inertia with respect to the principal axes. Thus, Iy -
2(1/12)(5.5)(4.875)3 + 2(0.5)(40)(2.875)2 = 433 in4 (18,022.8 cm4); then 
IxIIy.=
16,080/433 = 37.1.
For this ratio, the Wood Handbook specifies that "the beam should be restrained by
bridging or other bracing at intervals of not more than 8 ft (2.4 m)."

DETERMINING THE CAPACITY OF
A SOLID COLUMN

An 8 x 10 in (203.2 x 254 mm) column has an unbraced length of 10 ft 6 in (3.20 m). the
allowable compressive stress is 1500 lb/in2 (10,342.5 kPa), and E = 1,760,000 lb/in2
(12,135.2 MPa). Calculate the allowable load on this column (a) by applying the recom-
mendations of the Wood Handbook; (b) by applying the provisions of the National De-
sign Specification.

Calculation Procedure:
1. Record the properties of the member; evaluate k; classify
the column

Let L = unbraced length of column, in (mm); d = smaller side of rectangular section, in
(mm);/, = allowable compressive stress parallel to the grain in short column of the same
species, lb/in2 (kPa);/= allowable compressive stress parallel to grain in column under
investigation, lb/in2 (kPa).
The Wood Handbook divides columns into three categories: short, intermediate, and
long. Let K denote a parameter defined by the equation K = Q.64(E/fc)°-5.
The range of the slenderness ratio and the allowable stress for each category of col-
umn are as follows: short column, LId ^ 11 and/=/; intermediate column, 11 < LId ^ K
and/=/[l - 1A(LMK)4]; long column, LId > K and/= 0.274E/(L/d)2.
For this column, the area A - 71.3 in2 (460.03 cm2), using the dressed dimensions.
Then/,/</= 126/7.5 = 16.8. Also, K= 0.64(1,760,000/150O)05 = 21.9. Therefore, this is an
intermediate column because LId lies between K and 11.

2. Compute the capacity of the member

Use the relation capacity, Ib(N) = P = Af= 71.3(150O)[I- 1Xs(16.8/21.9)4] = 94,600 Ib
(420,780.8 N). This constitutes the solution to part a, using data from the Wood Hand-
book. For part Z?, data from the National Design Specification are used.

3. Compute the capacity of the column

Determine the stress 
from/= 
0.3QE/(L/d)2 = 0.30(1,760,000)/16.82 = 1870 lb/in2
(12,893.6 kPa). Se t t ing /= 1500 lb/in2 (10,342.5 kPa) gives P = Af= 71.3(1500) =
107,000 Ib (475,936 N). Note that the smaller stress value is used when the column ca-
pacity is computed.

DESIGN OFA SOLID WOODEN COLUMN

A 12-ft (3.7-m) long wooden column supports a load of 98 kips (435.9 kN). Design a sol-
id section in the manner recommended in the Wood Handbook, using/ = 1400 lb/in2
(9653 kPa) and E= 1,760,000 lb/in2 (12,135.2 MPa).

Calculation Procedure:
1. Assume that d = 7.5 in (19O.5 mm), and classify the column

Thus, LId= 144/7.5 = 19.2 and K= 0.64(1,760,000/140O)05 = 22.7. This is an intermedi-
ate column if the assumed dimension is correct.

2. Compute the required area and select a section

For an intermediate column, the stress/= 1400(1 - 1X3(19.2/22.7)4] = 1160 lb/in2 (7998.2
kPa). Then^ = PIf= 98,000/1160 = 84.5 in2 (545.19 cm2).
Study of the required area shows that an 8 * 12 in (203.2 * 304.8 mm) column having
an area of 86.3 in2 (556.81 cm2) should be used.

INVESTIGATION OFA SPACED COLUMN

The wooden column in Fig. 2 is composed of three 3 * 8 in (76.2 * 203.2 mm) sections.
Determine the capacity of the member if/c = 1400 lb/in2 (9653 kPa) and E = 1,760,000
lb/in2 (12,135.2 MPa).

Calculation Procedure:
1. Record the properties
of the elemental section

In analyzing a spaced column, it is necessary to as-
sess both the aggregate strength of the elements and
the strength of the built-up section. The end spacer
blocks exert a restraining effect on the elements and
thereby enhance their capacity. This effect is taken
into account by multiplying the modulus of elastici-
ty by a. fixity factor F.
The area of the column A = 19.7 in2 (127.10
cm2) when the dressed sizes are used. Also, LId =
114/2.625 = 43.4; F = 2.5; K = 0.64(2.5 x
1,760,000/140O)05 = 35.9. Therefore, this is a long
column.

2. Calculate the aggregate strength
of the elements

Thus ,/= Q214EI(LId)2 for a long column, or/ =
0.274(2.5)(l,760,000)/(43.4)2 = 640 lb/in2 (4412.8
kPa). P = 3(19.7)(640) = 37,800 Ib (168,134.4 N).

3. Repeat the foregoing steps 
for the built-up member 

FIGURE 2 Spaced col-
umn.

Thus, LId= 114/7.5 x 15.2; K= 22.7; therefore, this
is an intermediate column. Then / = 1400(1 -
'/3(15.2/22J)4] = 1306 lb/in2 (9004.9 kPa) > 640
lb/in2 (4412.8 kPa).
The column capacity is therefore limited by the elements and P = 37,800 Ib (168,134.4

N).

COMPRESSION ON
AN OBLIQUE PLANE

Determine whether the joint in Fig. 3 is satisfactory with respect to bearing if the allow-
able compressive stresses are 1400 and 400 lb/in2 (9653 and 2758 kPa) parallel and nor-
mal to the grain, respectively.

Calculation Procedure:

1. Compute the compressive stress

Thus, / = PIA = 9000/3.6252 = 685 lb/in2
(4723.1 kPa).

2. Compute the allowable
compression stress In the main
member

FIGURE 3 

Apply Hankinson's equation: N = PQI(P sin2 6
+ Q cos2 0), where P = allowable compressive
stress parallel to grain, lb/in2 (kPa); Q = allow-
able compressive stress normal to grain; lb/in2
(kPa); N = allowable compressive stress in-
clined to the grain, lb/in2 (IdPa); 6 = angle be-
tween action line of N and direction of grain.
Thus, sin2 0-0.36, cos2 0 = (4/5)2 = 0.64; then N= 1400(400)/(1400 x 0.36 + 400 x 0.64)
= 737 lb/in2 (5081.6 kPa) > 685 lb/in2 (4723.1 kPa). Therefore, the joint is satisfactory.

3. Alternatively, solve Hankinson's equation by using
the nomogram in the Wood Handbook

DESIGN OF A NOTCHED JOINT

In Fig. 4, Ml is a 4 x 4, F = 5500 Ib (24,464 N), and <f> = 30°. The allowable compressive
stresses are P = 1200 lb/in2 (8274 kPa) and Q = 390 lb/in2 (2689.1 kPa). The projection of
Ml into M2 is restricted to a vertical dis-
tance of 2.5 in (63.5 mm). Design a suit-
able notch.

Calculation Procedure:

1. Record the values of the
trigonometric functions of <f>

and ^/2

The most feasible type of notch is the
one shown in Fig. 4, in which AC and BC
bisect the angles between the intersect-
ing edges. The allowable bearing pres-
sures on these faces are therefore identi-
cal for the two members.

FIGURE 4 

With (f> = 30°, sin 30° = 0.500; sin 15 ° = 0.259; cos 15° = 0.966; tan 15° = 0.268.

2. Find the lengths AC and BC

Express these two lengths as functions of AB. Or, AB = b/sin </>); AC = [b sin (<|>/2)]/
sin <£); BC = [b cos (</>)/2)]/sin <£); AC = 3.625(0.259/0.500) = 1.9 in (48.26 mm);
BC = 3.625(0.966/0.500) = 7.0 in (177.8 mm). The projection into Ml is therefore not ex-
cessive.

3. Evaluate the stresses f1 and f2

Resolve F into components parallel to AC and BC. Thus,/! = (F sin <f))/(A tan </>/2);f2 = (F
sin <£)[tan (<£/2)]A4, where A = crossectional area of Ml. Substituting gives/j = 783 lb/in2
(5399 kPa);/2 = 56 lb/in2 (386.1 kPa).

4. Calculate the allowable stresses

Compute the allowable stresses NI and N2 on A C and BC, respectively, and compare these
with the actual stresses. Thus, by using Hankinson's equation from the previous calcula-
tion procedure, N1 = 1200(390)/(1200 x 0.2592 + 390 x 0.9662) = 1053 lb/in2 (7260.4
kPa). This is acceptable because it is greater than the actual stress. Also, N2 =
1200(390)/(1200 x 0.9662 + 390 x 0.2592) = 408 lb/in2 (2813.2 kPa). This is also accept-
able, and the joint is therefore satisfactory.

ALLOWABLE LATERAL LOAD ON NAILS

In Fig. 5, the Western hemlock members are connected with six 5OJ common nails. Cal-
culate the lateral load P that may be applied to this connection.

Calculation Procedure:
1. Determine the member group

The capacity of this connection is calculated
in conformity with Part VIII of the National
Design Specification. Refer to the Specifica-
tion to ascertain the classification of the
species. Western hemlock is in group III.

2. Determine the properties of
the nail

Refer to the Specification 
to determine the
properties of the nail. Calculate the penetra-
tion-diameter ratio, and compare this value
with that stipulated in the Specification. Thus, 
length = 5.5 in (139.7 mm); diameter = 0.244
in (6. 1976 mm); penetration/diameter ratio =
(5.5 - 1.63)70.244 = 15.9 > 13. This is accept-
able.

FIGURE 5

3. Find the capacity of the connection

Using the Specification, find the capacity of the nail. Then the capacity of the connection
= P = 6(165) = 990 Ib (4403.5 N).

CAPACITY OF LAG SCREWS

In Fig. 6, the cottonwood members are connected wtih three 5Xs-In (15.88-mm) lag screws
8 in (203.2 mm) long. Determine the load P that may be applied to this connection.

Calculation Procedure:

1. Determine the member group

The National Design Specification shows that cottonwood is classified in group IV.

2. Find the allowable screw/ loads

The National Design Specification gives the following values for each screw: allowable
load parallel to grain = 550 Ib (2446.4 N); allowable load normal to grain = 330 Ib
(1467.8 N).

3. Compute the allowable load on the connection

Use the Scholten nonibgram, or N= PQI(P sin2 B + Q cos2 O), with 0 = 50°, and solve as
given earlier. Either solution gives P = 3(395) = 1185 Ib (5270.9 N).

DESIGN OFA BOLTED SPLICE

A 6 x 12 in (152.4 x 304.8 mm) southern pine member carrying a tensile force of 56 kips
(249.1 kN) parallel to the grain is to be spliced with steel side plates. Design the splice.

Calculation Procedure:

1. Determine the number of bolts, and bolt size, required

Find the bolt capacity from the National Design Specification. The Specification allows a
25 percent increase in capacity of the parallel-to-grain loading when steel plates are used
as side members.
Determine the number of bolts from n = /Vcapacity per bolt, Ib (N), where P = load,
Ib (N). By assuming 5/8-in (22.2-mm) diameter bolts, n = 56,000/[3940(1.25)] = 11.4;
use 12 bolts. The value 1.25 in the denominator is the increase in bolt load mentioned
above.
As a trial, use three rows of four bolts each, as shown in Fig. 7.

FIGURE 6

FIG. 7

2. Determine whether the joint complies with the Specification

Assume 'fA-in (23.8-mm) diameter bolt holes. The gross area of the dressed lumber is
63.25 in2 (408.089 cm2). The net area = gross area - area of the bolt holes = 63.25 -
3(0.94)(5.5) = 47.74 in2 (308.018 cm2). The bearing area under the bolts = number of
bolts [bolt diameter, in (mm)] [width, in (mm)] = 12(0.875)(5.5) = 57.75 in2 (372.603
cm2). The ratio of the net to bearing area is 47.74/57.75 = 0.83 > 0.80. This is acceptable,
according to the Specification. The joint is therefore satisfactory, and the assumptions are
usable in the design.

3. Establish the longitudinal bolt spacing

Using the Specification, we find a = 4(7/8) = 3.5 in (88.90 mm); Z>min = 7(%) = 6% in
(155.58mm).

4. Establish the transverse bolt spacing

Using the Specification gives LID = 5.5(%) = 6.3 > 6. Make c = 2 in (50.8 mm) and d =
3% in (95.25 mm).

INVESTIGATION OF A
TIMBER-CONNECTOR JOINT

The members in Fig. 8a have the following sizes: A9 4 x 8 in (101.6 x 203.2 mm); B, 3 x
8 in (76.2 x 203.2 mm). They are connected by six 4-in (101.6-mm) split-ring connectors,
in the manner shown. The lumber is dense structural redwood. Investigate the adequacy
of this joint, and establish the spacing of the connectors.

Calculation Procedure:

1. Determine the allowable stress

The National Design Specification 
(11,721.5 kPa).

2. Find the lumber group

shows that the allowable stress is 1700 lb/in2

The Specification shows this species is classified in group C.

3. Compute the capacity of the connectors

The Specification shows that the capacity of a connector in parallel-to-grain loading for
group C lumber is 4380 Ib (19,482.2 N). With six connectors, the total capacity is 6(4380)
= 26,280 Ib (116,890 N). This is acceptable.

FIGURE 8

The Specification requires a minimum edge distance of 2% in (69.85 mm). The edge
distance in the present instance is 33A in (95.25 mm).

4. Calculate the net area of member A

Apply the dimensions of the groove, which are recorded in the Specification. Referring to
Fig. Sb, gross area = 27.19 in2 (175.430 cm2). The projected area of the groove and bolt
hole = 4.5(1.00) + 0.813(2.625) = 6.63 in2 (42.777 cm2). The net area = 27.19 - 6.63 =
20.56 in2 (132.7 cm2).

5. Calculate the stress at the net section; compare
with the allowable stress

The stress/= load/net area = 26,000/20.56 = 1260 lb/in2 (8688 kPa). From the Specifica-
tion, the allowable stress is/allow = (%)(1700) = 1488 lb/in2 (10,260 kPa). Also from the
Specification, f^w = 1650 lb/in2 (11,377 kPa). The joint is therefore satisfactory in all re-
spects.

6. Establish the connector spacing

Using the Specification, apply the recorded values without reduction because the connec-
tors are stressed almost to capacity. Thus, a = 1 in (177.8 mm) and b = 9 in (228.6 mm).

Soil Mechanics

The basic notational system used is c = unit cohesion; s = specific gravity; V = volume;
W = total weight; w = specific weight; 0 = angle of internal friction; T = shearing stress;
a = normal stress.

COMPOSITION OF SOIL

A specimen of moist soil weighing 122 g has an apparent specific gravity of 1.82. The
specific gravity of the solids is 2.53. After the specimen is oven-dried, the weight is 104
g. Compute the void ratio, porosity, moisture content, and degree of saturation of the orig-
inal mass.

Calculation Procedure:
1. Compute the weight of moisture, volume of mass, and volume
of each ingredient

In a three-phase soil mass, the voids, or pores, between the solid particles are occupied by
moisture and air. A mass that contains moisture but not air is termed fully saturated; this
constitutes a two-phase system. The term apparent specific gravity (denotes the specific
gravity of the mass.
Let the subscripts s, w, and a refer to the solids, moisture, and air, respectively. Where
a subscript is omitted, the reference is to the
entire mass. Also, let e = void ratio = (Vw +
Va)IV5; n = porosity = (Vw + V0)IV; MC =
moisture content = WJW5; S = degree of sat-
uration = VJ(VW + Va).
Refer to Fig. 1. A horizontal line repre-
sents volume, a vertical line represents specif-
ic gravity, and the area of a rectangle repre-
sents the weight of the respective ingredient
in grams.
Computing weight and volume gives W =
122 g; W3 = 104 g; Ww = 122 - 104 = 18 g;

2. Compute the properties of the original mass

Thus, e = 100(18.0 + 7.9)741.1 = 63.0 percent; n = 100(18.0 + 7.9)767.0 = 38.7 percent;
MC = 100(18)7104 = 17.3 percent; 5= 100(18.0)1(18.0 + 7.9) + 69.5 percent. The factor
of 100 is used to convert to percentage.
Soil composition is important from an environmental standpoint. Ever since the pas-
sage of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Superfund Program by Congress,
greater attention has been paid to soil composition by cities, states, and the federal gov-
ernment.
The major concern of regulators is with soil contaminated by industrial waste and
trash. Liquid wastes can pollute soil and streams. Solid waste can produce noxious odors
in the atmosphere. Some solid wastes are transported to "safe" sites for burning, where
they may pollute the local atmosphere. Superfund money pays for the removal and burn-
ing of solid wastes.
A tax on chemicals provides the money for Superfund operations. Public and civic re-
action to Superfund activities is most positive. Thus, quick removal of leaking drums of
dangerous materials by federal agencies has done much to reduce soil contamination. Fur-
ther, the Superfund Program has alerted industry to the dangers and effects of careless
disposal of undesirable materials.
There are some 1200 dump sites on the Superfund Program agenda requiring

cleanup. The work required at some sites ranges from excavation of buried waste to its
eventual disposal by incineration. Portable and mobile incinerators are being used for
wastes that do not pollute the air. Before any incineration can take place—either in
fixed or mobile incinerators—careful analysis of the effluent from the incinerator must
be made. For all these reasons, soil composition is extremely important in engineering
studies.

SPECIFIC WEIGHT OF SOIL MASS

A specimen of sand has a porosity of 35 percent, and the specific gravity of the solids is
2.70. Compute the specific weight of this soil in pounds per cubic foot (kilograms per cu-
bic meter) in the saturated and in the submerged state.

Calculation Procedure:
1. Compute the weight of the mass in each state

Set V= 1 cm3. The (apparent) weight of the mass when submerged equals the true weight
less the buoyant force of the water. Thus, Vw + V0 = nV= 0.35 cm3 V5 = 0.65 cm3. In the
saturated state, W= 2.70(0.65) + 0.35 = 2.105 g. In the submerged state, W= 2.105 - 1 =
1.105 g; or W= (2.70 - 1)0.65 = 1.105 g.

2. Find the weight of the soil

Multiply the foregoing values by 62.4 to find the specific weight of the soil in pounds per
cubic foot. Thus: saturated, w = 131.4 lb/ft3 (2104.82 kg/m3); submerged, w = 69.0 lb/ft3
(1105.27 kg/m3).

ANALYSIS OF QUICKSAND CONDITIONS

Soil having a void ratio of 1.05 contains particles having a specific gravity of 2.72. Com-
pute the hydraulic gradient that will produce a quicksand condition.

Calculation Procedure:
1. Compute the minimum gradient causing quicksand

As water percolates through soil, the head that induces flow diminishes in the direction of
flow as a result of friction and viscous drag. The drop in head in a unit distance is termed
the hydraulic gradient. A quicksand condition exists when water that is flowing upward
has a sufficient momentum to float the soil particles.
Let / denote the hydraulic gradient in the vertical direction and ic the minimum gradi-
ent that causes quicksand. Equate the buoyant force on a soil mass to the submerged
weight of the mass to find ic. Or

ss-l
^TTe 

(1)

For this situation, ic = (2.72 - 1)7(1 + 1.05) = 0.84.

MEASUREMENT OF PERMEABILITY
BY FALLING-HEAD PERMEAMETER

A specimen of soil is placed in a falling-head permeameter. The specimen has a cross-
sectional area of 66 cm2 and a height of 8 cm; the standpipe has a cross-sectional area of
0.48 cm2. The head on the specimen drops from 62 to 40 cm in 1 h 18 mm. Determine the
coefficient of permeability of the soil, in centimeters per minute.

Calculation Procedure:
1. Using literal values, equate the instantaneous discharge
in the specimen to that in the standpipe

The velocity at which water flows through a soil is a function of the coefficient of perme-
ability, or hydraulic conductivity, of the soil. By Darcy's law of laminar flow,

v = ki 

(2)

where / = hydraulic gradient, k = coefficient of permeability, v = velocity.
In a falling-head permeameter, water is allowed to flow vertically from a standpipe
through a soil specimen. Since the water is not replenished, the water level in the stand-
pipe drops as flow continues, and the velocity is therefore variable. Let A = cross-section-
al area of soil specimen; a = cross-sectional area of standpipe; h = head on specimen at
given instant; H1 and H2 = head at beginning and end, respectively, of time interval T; L =
height of soil specimen; Q = discharge at a given instant.
Using literal values, we have Q = Aki = -a dhfdt.

2. Evaluate k

Since the head h is dissipated in flow through the soil, i = h/L. By substituting and rear-
ranging, (AkIL)dT= - a

(b) Relaxation grid

In Fig. 2a, where water flows under a dam under a head H9 lines AB and CD are flow
lines and EF and GH are equipotential lines.

2. Discuss the relationship of flow and equipotential lines

Since a water particle flowing from one equipotential line to another of smaller head will
traverse the shortest path, it follows that flow lines and equipotential lines intersect at
right angles, thus forming a system of orthogonal curves. In a flow net, the equipotential
lines should be so spaced that the difference in head between successive lines is a con-
stant, and the flow lines should be so spaced that the discharge through the space between
successive lines is a constant. A flow net constructed in compliance with these rules illus-
trates the basic characteristics of the flow. For example, a close spacing of equipotential
lines signifies a rapid loss of head in that region.

3. Write the velocity equation

Let h denote the head on the water at a given point. Equation 2 can be written as

dh
v = -k—-

(2a)

where dL denotes an elemental distance along the flow line.

4. State the particular form of the general Laplace equation

Let jc and z denote a horizontal and vertical coordinate axis, respectively. By investigating
the two-dimensional flow through an elemental rectangular prism of homogeneous, isen-
tropic soil, and combining Eq. Ia with the equation of continuity, the particular form of
the general Laplace equation

#h 

^h

^ + ^= ° 

(4)

is obtained.
This equation is analogous to the equation for the flow of an electric current through a
conducting sheet of uniform thickness and the equation of the trajectory of principal
stress. (This is a curve that is tangent to the direction of a principal stress at each point
along the curve. Refer to earlier calculation procedures for a discussion of principal
stresses.)
The seepage of moisture through soil may be investigated by analogy with either the
flow of an electric current or the stresses in a body. In the latter method, it is merely nec-

essary to load a body in a manner that produces identical boundary conditions and then to
ascertain the directions of the principal stresses.

5. Apply the principal-stress analogy

Refer to Fig. 2a. Consider the surface directly below the dam to be subjected to a uniform
pressure. Principal-stress trajectories may be readily constructed by applying the princi-
ples of elasticity. In the flow net, flow lines correspond to the minor-stress trajectories
and equipotential lines correspond to the major-stress trajectories. In this case, the flow
lines are ellipses having their foci at the edges of the base of the dam, and the equipoten-
tial lines are hyperbolas.
A flow net may also be constructed by an approximate, trial-and-error procedure
based on the method of relaxation. Consider that the area through which discharge occurs
is covered with a grid of squares, a part of which is shown in Fig. 2b. If it is assumed that
the hydraulic gradient is constant within each square, Eq. 5 leads to

hl+h2 + h3 + h4-4hQ = 0 

(5)

Trial values are assigned to each node in the grid, and the values are adjusted until a
consistent set of values is obtained. With the approximate head at each node thus estab-
lished, it becomes a simple matter to draw equipotential lines. The flow lines are then
drawn normal thereto.

SOIL PRESSURE CAUSED BY POINT LOAD

A concentrated vertical load of 6 kips (26.7 IcN) is applied at the ground surface. Compute
the vertical pressure caused by this load at a point 3.5 ft (1.07 m) below the surface and 4
ft (1.2 m) from the action line of the force.

Calculation Procedure:
1. Sketch the load conditions

Figure 3 shows the load conditions. In Fig. 3, O denotes the point
at which the load is applied, and A denotes the point under consid-
eration. Let R denote the length of OA and r and z denote the
length of OA as projected on a horizontal and vertical plane, re-
spectively.

152.4 cm) that lies 2 ft (61.0 cm) below the surface and has one vertex on the action line

Calculation Procedure:
1. State the equation for the total force

Refer to Fig. 4a, where A and B denote the dimensions of the rectangle, H its distance

axes along the sides of the rectangle, as shown. Let C = A2 + H2, D = B2 + H2, E = A2 + B2

The force dF on an elemental area dA is given by the Boussinesq equation as dF =

APPRAISAL OF SHEARING CAPACITY OF
SOIL BY TRIAXIAL COMPRESSION TEST

Two samples of a soil were subjected to triaxial compression tests, and it was found that
failure occurred under the following principal stresses: sample 1, (T1 = 6960 lb/ft2 (333.2
kPa) and cr3 = 2000 lb/ft2 (95.7 kPa); sample 2, (T1 = 9320 lb/ft2 (446.2 kPa) and V3 =
3000 lb/ft2 (143.6 kPa). Find the cohesion and angle of internal friction of this soil, both
trigonometrically and graphically.

Calculation Procedure:
1. State the equation for the angle <f>

Trigonometric method: Let S and D denote the sum and difference, respectively, of the
stresses (T1 and (T3. By referring to Fig. 6<z, develop this equation:

D - S sin (f> = 2c cos (f>

where the subscripts correspond to the sample numbers.

2. Evaluate <f> and c

By Eq. 11, S1 = 8960 lb/ft2 (429.0 kPa); D1 = 4960 lb/ft2 (237.5 kPa); S2 = 12,320 lb/ft2
(589.9 kPa); D2 = 6320 lb/ft2 (302.6 kPa); sin <£ = (6320 - 4960)/(12,320 - 8960); <£ =
23°53'. Evaluating c, using Eq. 10, gives c = Y2(D sec ^-Stan </>) = 729 lb/ft2 (34.9 kPa).

3. For the graphical solution, use the Mohr's circle

Draw the Mohr's circle associated with each set of principal stresses, as shown in Fig. 7.

4. Draw the envelope; measure its angle of inclination

Draw the envelope (common tangent) FHH', and measure OF and the angle of inclination
of the envelope. In practice, three of four samples should be tested and the average value
of 0 and c determined.

EAATH THRUST ON RETAINING WALL
CALCULATED BY RANKINE'S THEORY

A retaining wall supports sand weighing 100 lb/ft3 (15.71 kN/m3) and having an angle of
internal friction of 34°. The back of the wall is vertical, and the surface of the backfill is
inclined at an angle of 15° with the horizontal. Applying Rankine's theory, calculate the
active earth pressure on the wall at a point 12 ft (3.7 m) below the top.

Calculation Procedure:
1. Construct the Mohr's circle associated with the soil prism

Rankine's theory of earth pressure applies to a uniform mass of dry cohesionless soil.
This theory considers the state of stress at the instant of impending failure caused by a
slight yielding of the wall. Let h = vertical distance from soil surface to a given point, ft
(m); p = resultant pressure on a vertical plane at the given point, lb/ft2 (kPa); <£ = ratio of
shearing stress to normal stress on given plane; 0 = angle of inclination of earth surface.
The quantity o may also be defined as the tangent of the angle between the resultant stress
on a plane and a line normal to this plane; it is accordingly termed the obliquity of the re-
sultant stress.
Consider the elemental soil prism abed in Fig. 8a, where faces ab and dc are parallel to
the surface of the backfill and faces be and ad are vertical. The resultant pressure pv on ab
is vertical, and/? is parallel to the surface. Thus, the resultant stresses on ab and be have
the same obliquity, namely, tan 6. (Stresses having equal obliquities are called conjugate
stresses.) Since failure impends, there is a particular plane for which the obliquity is tan
*.

In Fig. 86, construct Mohr's circle associated with this soil prism. Using a suitable
scale, draw line OD, making an angle Q with the base line, where OD represents pv. Draw
line OQ, making an angle <£ with the base line. Draw a circle that has its center C on the
base line, passes through D, and is tangent to OQ. Line OD' represents/?. Draw CM per-
pendicular to OD.

By substituting, w = 100 lb/ft3 (15.71 kN/m3); A = 12 ft (3.7 m); O = 15°; <£ = 34°; p =
0.321(100)(12) = 385 lb/ft2 (18.4 kPa).
The lateral pressure that accompanies a slight displacement of the wall away from the
retained soil is termed active pressure; that which accompanies a slight displacement of
the wall toward the retained soil is termed passive pressure. By an analogous procedure,
the passive pressure is

EARTH THRUST ON RETAINING WALL
CALCULATED BY COULOMB'S THEORY

A retaining wall 20 ft (6.1 m) high supports sand weighing 100 lb/ft3 (15.71 kN/m3) and
having an angle of internal friction of 34°. The back of the wall makes an angle of 8° with
the vertical; the surface of the backfill makes an angle of 9° with the horizontal. The angle
of friction between the sand and wall is 20°. Applying Coulomb's theory, calculate the to-
tal thrust of the earth on a 1-ft (30.5-cm) length of the wall.

Calculation Procedure:
1. Determine the resultant pressure P of the wall

Refer to Fig. 9a. Coulomb's theory postulates that as the wall yields slightly, the soil
tends to rupture along some plane BC through the heel.
Let 8 denote the angle of friction between the soil and wall. As shown in Fig. 9b, the
wedge ABC is held in equilibrium by three forces: the weight W of the wedge, the result-
ant pressure R of the soil beyond the plane of failure, and the resultant pressure P of the
wall, which is equal and opposite to the thrust exerted by the each on the wall. The forces
R and P have the directions indicated in Fig. 9b. By selecting a trial wedge and computing
its weight, the value of P may be found by drawing the force polygon. The problem is to
identify the wedge that yields the maximum value of P.
In Fig. 90, perform this construction: Draw a line through B at an angle <£ with the hor-
izontal, intersecting the surface at D. Draw line AE, making an angle 8+ 4> with the back
of the wall; this line makes an angle /3 - 8 with BD. Through an arbitrary point C on the
surface, draw CF parallel to AE. Triangle BCF is similar to the triangle of forces in Fig.
9b. Then P = Wu/x, where W = w(area ABQ.

2. Set dP/dx = O and state Rebhann's theorem

This theorem states: The wedge that exerts the maximum thrust on the wall is that for
which triangle ABC and BCF have equal areas.

4. Evaluate P, using the foregoing equations

Thus, <£ = 34°; 8 = 20°; 0 = 9°; p = 82°; LABD = 64°; LBAE = 54°; LAEB = 62°; LBAD
= 91°; ^4£>£ = 25°; AB = 20 esc 82° = 20.2 ft (6.16 m). In triangle ABD: BD = AB sin
91°/sin 25° = 47.8 ft (14.57 m). In triangle ABE: BE = AB sin 54°/sin 62° = 18.5 ft (5.64
m); AE = AB sin 64°/sin 62° = 20.6 ft (6.28 m); x2 = 18.5(47.8); x = 29.7 ft (9.05 m); u =
20.6(47.8)7(29.7 + 47.8) = 12.7 ft (3.87 m); P = y2(100)(12.7)2 sin 62°; P = 7120 Ib/ft
(103,909 N/m) of wall.

5. Alternatively, determine u graphically

Do this by drawing Fig. 9a to a suitable scale.
Many situations do not lend themselves to analysis by Rebhann's theorem. For in-
stance, the backfill may be nonhomogeneous, the earth surface may not be a plane, a sur-
charge may be applied over part of the surface, etc. In these situations, graphical analysis
gives the simplest solution. Select a trial wedge, compute its weight and the surcharge it
carries, and find P by constructing the force polygon as shown in Fig. 9b. After several
trial wedges have been investigated, the maximum value of P will become apparent.
If the backfill is cohesive, the active pressure on the retaining wall is reduced. Howev-
er, in view of the difficulty of appraising the cohesive capacity of a disturbed soil, most
designers prefer to disregard cohesion.

EARTHTHRUSTONTIMBERED
TRENCH CALCULATED BY GENERAL
WEDGE THEORY

A timbered trench of 12-ft (3.7-m) depth retains a cohesionless soil having a horizontal
surface. The soil weighs 100 Ib/ft3 (15.71 kN/m3), its angle of internal friction is 26°30',
and the angle of friction between the soil and timber is 12°. Applying Terzaghi's general
wedge theory, compute the total thrust of the soil on a 1-ft (30.5-cm) length of trench. As-
sume that the resultant acts at middepth.

Calculation Procedure:
1. Start the graphical construction

Refer to Fig. 10. The soil behind a timbered trench and that behind a cantilever retaining
wall tend to fail by dissimilar modes, for in the former case the soil is restrained against
horizontal movement at the surface by bracing across the trench. Consequently, the soil
behind a trench tends to fail along a curved surface that passes through the base and is
vertical at its intersection with the ground surface. At impending failure, the resultant

Logarithmic

FIGURE 10. General wedge theory applied to timbered trench.

force dR acting on any elemental area on the failure surface makes an angle </> with the
normal to this surface.
The general wedge theory formulated by Terzaghi postulates that the arc of failure is a
logarithmic spiral. Let V0 denote a reference radius vector and v denote the radius vector
to a given point on the spiral. The equation of the curve is

r = r0eaian<i> 

(20)

where r0 = length of V0, r = length of v; a = angle between V0 and v; e = base of natural
logarithms = 2.718
The property of this curve that commends it for use in this analysis is that at every
point the radius vector and the normal to the curve make an angle 0 with each other.
Therefore, if the failure line is defined by Eq. 20, the action line of the resultant force dR
at any point is a radius vector or, in other words, the action line passes through the center
of the spiral. Consequently, the action line of the total resultant force R also passes
through the center.
The pressure distribution on the wall departs radically from a hydrostatic one, and the
resultant thrust P is applied at a point considerably above the lower third point of the wall.
Terzaghi recommends setting the ratio BDIAB at between 0.5 and 0.6.
Perform the following construction: Using a suitable scale, draw line AB to represent
the side of the trench, and draw a line to represent the ground surface. At middepth, draw
the action line of P at an angle of 12° with the horizontal.
On a sheet of transparent paper, draw the logarithmic spiral representing Eq. 20, set-
ting cf> = 260SO' and assigning any convenient value to r0. Designate the center of the spi-
ral as O.
Select a point C1 on the ground surface, and draw a line L through C1 at an angle $

with the horizontal. Superimpose the drawing containing the spiral on the main drawing,
orienting it in such a manner that O lies on L and the spiral passes through B and C1. On
the main drawing, indicate the position of the center of the spiral, and designate this point
as O1. Line ^C1 is normal to the spiral at C1 because it makes an angle </> with the radius
vector, and the spiral is therefore vertical at C1.

2. Compute the total weight W of the soil above the failure line

Draw the action line of Wby applying these approximations:

Area of wedge = 2A(AB)AC1 

c = 0.44C1 

Scale the lever arms a and b.

3. Evaluate P by taking moments with respect to O1

Since R passes through this point,

bW
P=- 

(21)

(22)

4. Select a second point C2 on the ground surface; repeat
the foregoing procedure
5. Continue this process until the maximum value of P is obtained

After investigating this problem intensively, Peckworth concluded that the distance AC to
the true failure line varies between OAh and 0.5/j, where h is the depth of the trench. It is
therefore advisable to select some point that lies within this range as the first trial position
ofC.

The lateral pressure of the soil below the water level consists of two elements: the pres-
sure exerted by the solids and that exerted by the water. The first element is evaluated by
applying the appropriate equation with w equal to the weight of the soil in the submerged
state. The second element is assumed to be the full hydrostatic pressure, as though the
solids were not present. Since there is water on both sides of the structure, the hydrostatic
pressures balance one another and may therefore be disregarded.
In calculating the forces on a bulkhead, it is assumed that the pressure distribution is
hydrostatic (i.e., that the pressure varies linearly with the depth), although this is not
strictly true with regard to a flexible wall.
Computing the specific weight of the soil in the submerged state gives w = 1 1 4 - ( l-
0.42)62.4 - 77.8 lb/ft3 (12.22 kN/m3).

2. Compute the vertical pressure at A, B, and C caused by the
surcharge and weight of solids

Thus, pA = 320 lb/ft2 (15.3 kPa); pB = 320 + 5(114) = 890 lb/ft2 (42.6 kPa); pc = 890 +
12(77.8) = 1824 lb/ft2 (87.3 kPa).

3. Compute the Rankine coefficient of active earth pressure

Determine the lateral pressure at A9 B and C. Since the surface is horizontal, Eq. 171 ap-
plies, with </> = 34°. Refer to Fig. lib. Then C0 = tan2 (450 - 170) = 0.283; pA =
0.283(320) = 91 lb/ft2 (4.3 kPa);p5 = 252 lb/ft2 (12.1 kPa);/?c= 516 lb/ft2 (24.7 kPa).

4. Compute the total thrust between A and C

Thus, P = 1/2(5)(91 + 252) + V2 (12)(252 + 516) = 5466 Ib (24,312.7 N).

CANTILEVER BULKHEAD ANALYSIS

Sheet piling is to function as a cantilever retaining wall 5 ft (1.5 m) high. The soil weighs
110 lb/ft3 (17.28 kN/m3) and its angle of internal friction is 32°; the backfill has a hori-
zontal surface. Determine the required depth of penetration of the bulkhead.

Calculation Procedure:
1. Take moments with respect
to C to obtain an equation for
the minimum value of d

Refer to Fig. 12a, and consider a 1-ft (30.5-
cm) length of wall. Assume that the pres-
sure distribution is hydrostatic, and apply
Rankine's theory.
The wall pivots about some point Z near
the bottom. Consequently, passive earth 
pressure is mobilized to the left of the wall 
betwen B and Z and to the right of the wall 

( a> Cantilever

FIGURE 12

(b) Assumed pressures and

r e s u l t a nt forces

between Z and C. Let P = resultant active pressure on wall; R1 and R2 = resultant passive
pressure above and below center of rotation, respectively.
The position of Z may be found by applying statics. But to simplify the calculations,
these assumptions are made: The active pressure extends from A to C; the passive pres-
sure to the left of the wall extends from B to C; and R2
 acts at C. Figure YIb illustrates
these assumptions.
By taking moments with respect to C and substituting values for R1 and R2,

d= «ycj«-i 

(23)

2. Substitute numerical values and solve for d

Thus, 45° + Y2(f> = 61°; 45° - Y2^ = 29°. By Eqs. 15 and 16, Cp/Ca = (tan 61°/tan 29°)2 =
10.6; d'= 5/[(10.6)1/3 - 1] = 4.2 ft (1.3 m). Add 20 percent of the computed value to pro-
vide a factor of safety and to allow for the development of R2. Thus, penetration =
4.2(1.2) = 5.0 ft (1.5m).

ANCHORED BULKHEAD ANALYSIS

Sheet piling is to function as a retaining wall 20 ft (6.1 m) high, anchored by tie rods
placed 3 ft (0.9 m) from the top at an 8-ft (2.4-m) spacing. The soil weighs 110 lb/ft3
(17.28 kN/m3), and its angle of internal friction is 32°. The backfill has a horizontal sur-
face and carries a surcharge of 200 lb/ft2 (9.58 kPa). Applying the equivalent-beam
method, determine the depth of penetration to secure a fixed earth support, the tension in
the tie rod, and the maximum bending moment in the piling.

Calculation Procedure:
1. Locate C and construct the net-pressure diagram for AC

Refer to Fig. 13«. The depth of penetration is readily calculated if stability is the sole cri-
terion. However, when the depth is increased beyond this minimum value, the tension in

the rod and the bending moment in the piling are reduced; the net result is a saving in ma-
terial despite the increased length.
Investigation of this problem discloses that the most economical depth of penetration
is that for which the tangent to the elastic curve at the lower end passes through the an-
chorage point. If this point is considered as remaining stationary, this condition can be de-
scribed as one in which the elastic curve is vertical at Z), the surrounding soil acting as a
fixed support. Whereas an equation can be derived for the depth associated with this con-
dition, such an equation is too cumbersome for rapid solution.
When the elastic curve is vertical at D, the lower point of contraflexure lies close to
the point where the net pressure (the difference between active pressure to the right and
passive pressure to the left of the wall) is zero. By assuming that the point of contraflex-
ure and the point of zero pressure are in fact coincident, this problem is transformed to
one that is statically determinate. The method of analysis based on this assumption is
termed the equivalent-beam method.
When the piling is driven to a depth greater than the minimum needed for stability, it
deflects in such a manner as to mobilize passive pressure to the right of the wall at its low-
er end. However, the same simplifying assumption concerning the pressure distribution as
made in the previous calculation procedure is made here.
Let C denote the point of zero pressure. Consider a 1-ft (30.5-cm) length of wall, and
let T- reaction at anchorage point and V= shear at C.
Locate C and construct the net-pressure diagram for AC as shown in Fig. 136.
Thus, w = 110 lb/ft3 (17.28 kN/m3) and 0 = 32°. Then Ca = tan2 (45° - 16°) - 0.307;
Cp = tan2 (45° + 16°) = 3.26; Cp-Ca = 2.953; pA = 0.307(200) = 61 lb/ft2 (2.9 kPa);
pB = 61 + 0.307(2O)(IlO) = 737 lb/ft2 (35.3 kPa); a = 737/[2.953(11O)] = 2.27 ft (0.69
m).

2. Calculate the resultant forces P1 and P2

Thus, P1 = 1/2(20)(61 + 737) = 7980 Ib (35,495.0 N); P2 = 1/2(2.27)(737) = 836 Ib (3718.5
N); PI + P2 = 8816 Ib (39,213.6 N).

3. Equate the bending moment at C to zero to find T, V,
and the tension in the tie rod

Thus b = 2.27 + (2%)(737 + 2 x 61)/(737 + 61) = 9.45 ft (2.880 m); c = 2/s(2.27) = 1.51 ft
(0.460 m); SMC = 19.27T- 9.45(7980) - 1.51(836) = O; T= 3980 Ib (17,703.0 N); V =
8816 - 3980 = 4836 Ib (21,510.5 N). The tension in the rod = 3980(8) - 31,840 Ib
(141,624.3N).

4. Construct the net-pressure diagram for CD

Refer to Fig. 13c and calculate the distance Jt. (For convenience, Fig. 13c is drawn to a
different scale from that of Fig. lib.) ThuspD = 2953(1 IQx) - 324.8*; R1 = ^(324.S*2) =
162.4*2; SMD = RlX/3 -Vx = 0;Rl = 3V; 162 Ax2 = 3(4836); x = 9.45 ft (2.880 m).

5. Establish the depth of penetration

To provide a factor of safety and to compensate for the slight inaccuracies inherent in this
method of analysis, increase the computed depth by about 20 percent. Thus, penetration =
1.20(0+*) = 14 ft (4.3m).

6. Locate the point of zero shear; calculate the piling maximum
bending moment

Refer to Fig. 136. Locate the point E of zero shear. Thus pE = 61 + 0.307(11Oy) = 61 +
33.11y; y2y(pA + pE) = T; or '/2X122 + 33.1Iy) = 3980; y = 13.6 ft (4.1 m), and/^ = 520
lb/ft2 (24.9 kPa); Mmax = ME = 3980(10.6 - (13.6/3)(520 + 2 x 61)/(520 + 61)] - 22,300
ft-lb/ft (99.190 N-m/m) of piling. Since the tie rods provide intermittent rather than con-
tinuous support, the piling sustains biaxial bending stresses.

STABILITY OF SLOPE BY METHOD
OFSLICES

Investigate the stability of the slope in Fig. 14 by the method of slices (also known as the
Swedish method). The properties of the upper and lower soil strata, designated as A and
B, respectively, are A—w = 110 lb/ft3 (17.28 kN/m3); c = O; <£ = 28°; B~w = 122 lb/ft3
(19.16 kN/m3); c = 650 lb/ft2 (31.1 kPa); </> - 10°. Stratum A is 36 ft (10.9 m) deep. A sur-
charge of 8000 Ib/lin ft (116,751.2 N/m) is applied 20 ft (6.1 m) from the edge.

Calculation Procedure:
1. Locate the center of the trial arc of failure passing through
the toe

It is assumed that failure of an embankment occurs along a circular arc, the prism of soil
above the failure line tending to rotate about an axis through the center of the arc. Howev-
er, there is no direct method of identifying the arc along which failure is most likely to oc-
cur, and it is necessary to resort to a cut-and-try procedure.
Consider a soil mass having a thickness of 1 ft (30.5 cm) normal to the plane of the
drawing; let O denote the center of a trial arc of failure that passes through the toe. For a
given inclination of embankment, Fellenius recommends certain values of a and /3 in lo-
cating the first trial arc.
Locate O by setting a = 25° and /B = 35°.

2. Draw the arc AC and the boundary line ED of the two strata

FIGURE 14

3. Compute the length of arc AD

Scale the radius of the arc and the central angle AOD, and compute the length of the arc
AD. Thus, radius = 82.7 ft (25.2 m); arc AD = 120 ft (36.6 m).

4. Determine the distance horizontally from O to the applied load

Scale the horizontal distance from O to the applied load. This distance is 52.6 ft (16.0 m).

5. Divide the soil mass into vertical strips

Starting at the toe, divide the soil mass above AC into vertical strips of 12-ft (3.7-m)
width, and number the strips. For simplicity, consider that D lies on the boundary line be-
tween strips 9 and 10, although this is not strictly true.

6. Determine the volume and weight of soil in each strip

By scaling the dimensions or using a planimeter, determine the volume of soil in each
strip; then compute the weight of soil. For instance, for strip 5: volume of soil A = 252 ft3
(7.13 m3); volume of soil B = 278 ft3 (7.87 m3); weight of soil = 252(110) + 278(122) =
61,600 Ib (273,996.8 N). Record the results in Table 1.

7. Draw a vector below each strip

This vector represents the weight of the soil in the strip. (Theoretically, this vector should
lie on the vertical line through the center of gravity of the soil, but such refinement is not
warranted in this analysis. For the interior strips, place each vector on the vertical center-
line.)

8. Resolve the soil weights vectorially into components normal
and tangential to the circular arc
9. Scale the normal and tangential vectors; record the results in
Table 1
10. Total the normal forces acting on soils A and B; total the
tangential forces

Failure of the embankment along arc AC would be characterized by the clockwise rota-
tion of the soil prism above this arc about an axis through O, this rotation being induced

by the unbalanced tangential force along the arc and by the external load. Therefore, con-
sider a tangential force as positive if its moment with respect to an axis through O is
clockwise and negative if this moment is counterclockwise. In the method of slices, it is
assumed that the lateral forces on each soil strip approximately balance each other.

11. Evaluate the moment tending to cause rotation about O

In the absence of external loads,

DM = rST 

(24)

where DM = disturbing moment; r - radius of arc; ST = algebraic sum of tangential
forces.
In the present instance, DM = 82.7(115) + 52.6(8) = 9930 ft-kips (13,465.1 kN-m).

12. Sum the frictional and cohesive forces to find the maximum
potential resistance to rotation; determine the stabilizing moment

In general,

F= SN tan 0 C = cL 

SM = r(F + O 

(25)

(26)

where F = frictional force; C = cohesive force; SN= sum of normal forces; L = length of
arc along which cohesion exists; SM = stabilizing moment.
In the present instance, F = 425 tan 10° + 31.9 tan 28° = 91.9 kips (408.77 kN); C =
0.65(120) = 78.0; total of F + C = 169.9 kips (755.72 kN); SM = 82.7(169.9) = 14,050
ft-kips (19,051.8 kN-m).

13. Compute the factor of safety against failure

The factor of safety is FS = SM/DM = 14,050/9930 =1.41.

14. Select another trial arc of failure; repeat the foregoing
procedure
15. Continue this process until the minimum value of FS
is obtained

The minimum allowable factor of safety is generally regarded as 1.5.

STABILITY OF SLOPE BY ^CIRCLE METHOD

Investigate the stability of the slope in Fig. 15 by the ^-circle method. The properties of
the soil are w 120 lb/ft3 (18.85 kN/m3); c = 550 lb/ft2 (26.3 kPa); <f> = 4°.

Calculation Procedure:
1. Locate the first trial position

The 0-circle method of analysis formulated by Krey is useful where standard conditions
are encountered. In contrast to the assumption concerning the stabilizing forces stated ear-
lier, the ^-circle method assumes that the soil has mobilized its maximum potential fric-
tional resistance plus whatever cohesive resistance is needed to prevent failure. A com-
parison of the maximum available cohesion with the required cohesion serves as an index
of the stability of the embankment.

4>- circle

FIGURE 15

In Fig. 15, O is the center of an assumed arc of failure AC. Let W= weight of soil mass
above arc AC; R = resultant of all normal and frictional forces existing along arc AC; C =
resultant cohesive force developed; L0 = length of arc AC; L0 = length of chord AC. The
soil above the arc is in equilibrium under the forces W, R9 and C. Since W is known in
magnitude and direction, the magnitude of C may be readily found if the directions of H
and C are determined.
Locate the first trial position of O by setting a = 25° and /3 = 35°.

2. Draw the arc AC and the radius OM bisecting this arc
3. Establish rectangular coordinate axes at O, making OM the
y axis
4. Obtain the needed basic data

Scale the drawing or make the necessary calculations. Thus, r = 78.8 ft (24.02 m); L0 =
154.6 ft (47.12 m); L0 = 131.0 ft (39.93 m); area above arc - 4050 ft2 (376.2 m2); W =
4050(120) - 486,000 Ib (2,161,728 N); horizontal distance from A to centroid of area =
66.7 ft (20.33 m).

5. Draw the vector representing W

Since the soil is homogeneous, this vector passes through the centroid of the area.

6. State the equation for C; locate its action line

Thus,

C = Cx = CL, 

(27)

The action line of C is parallel to the x axis. Determine the distance a by taking moments
about O. Thus M = aC = acLc.

a =

out introducing any significant error. Thus,
in Fig. 16, the soil prism OAB tends to
heave by sliding downward along OA under
active pressure and sliding upward along ab
against passive pressure. As stated earlier,
these planes of failure make an angle of a =
45° + 
l/2<f> with the principal planes.
Let b = width of footing; h = distance
from ground surface to bottom of footing; p
= soil pressure directly below footing. By
equating the total active and passive pres-
sures, state the following equation defining 
the conditions at impending failure:

FIGURE 16

p = wh tan4 a + 

w&(tan5 a - tan a)
+ 2c (tan a + tan3 a) 

(30)

2. Substitute numerical values; solve for b; evaluate p

Thus, h = Q;p = 58/6; 0 = 15°; a = 45° + 7°30' = 52°30'; 58/b = 0.1056(3.759 - 1.303)74
+ 2(1.2)(1.303 + 2.213); b = 6.55 ft (1.996 m);/? = 58,000/6.55 = 8850 lb/ft2 (423.7 kPa).

SOIL CONSOLIDATIONAND CHANGE
IN VOID RATIO

In a laboratory test, a load was applied to a soil specimen having a height of 30 in (762.0
mm) and a void ratio of 96.0 percent. What was the void ratio when the load settled A in
(12.7mm)?

Calculation Procedure:
1. Construct a diagram representing the volumetric composition
of the soil in the original and final states

According to the Terzaghi theory of consolidation, the compression of a soil mass under
an increase in pressure results primarily from the expulsion of water from the pores. At
the instant the load is applied, it is supported entirely by the water, and the hydraulic gra-
dient thus established induces flow. However, the flow in turn causes a continuous trans-
fer of load from the water to the solids.
Equilibrium is ultimately attained when the
load is carried entirely by the solids, and the
expulsion of the water then ceases. The time
rate of expulsion, and therefore of consolida-
tion, is a function of the permeability of the
soil, the number of drainage faces, etc. Let H-
original height of soil stratum; s = settlement;
C1 = original void ratio; e2 = final void ratio.
Using the given data, construct the diagram in
Fig. 17, representing the volumetric composi-
tion of the soil in the original and final states.

2. State the equation relating the four defined quantities

Thus,

(31)

3. Solve for e2

Thus: H= 30 in (762.0 mm); s = 0.50 in (12.7 mm); C1 = 0.960; e2 = 92.7 percent.

COMPRESSION INDEX AND VOID RATIO
OFA SOIL

A soil specimen under a pressure of 1200 lb/ft2 (57.46 kPa) is found to have a void ratio
of 103 percent. If the compression index is 0.178, what will be the void ratio when the
pressure is increased to 5000 lb/ft2 (239.40 kPa)?

Calculation Procedure:
1. Define the compression index

By testing a soil specimen in a consolidometer, it is possible to determine the void ratio
associated with a given compressive stress. When the sets of values thus obtained are
plotted on semilogarithmic scales (void ratio vs. logarithm of stress), the resulting dia-
gram is curved initially but becomes virtually a straight line beyond a specific point. The
slope of this line is termed the compression index.

2. Compute the soil void ratio

Let Cc = compression index; ^1 and e2 — original and final void ratio, respectively; Cr1 and
(T2 - original and final normal stress, respectively.
Write the equation of the straight-line portion of the diagram:

^1-S2 = QlOg- 

(T2

(32)

Substituting and solving give 1.03 - e2 = 0.178 log (5000/1200); e2 = 92.0 percent. Note
that the logarithm is taken to the base 10.
Landfills—where municipal and industrial wastes are discarded—are subject to soil
consolidation because of gradual contraction of the components. To hasten this contrac-
tion and reduce the space needed for trash, some communities are mining established
landfills.
When a trash landfill is mined, more than half of the contents may be combustible in
an incinerator. Useful electric power can be produced by burning the recovered trash. In
one landfill, some 54 percent of the trash is burned, 36 percent is recycled to cover new
trash, and 10 percent is returned to the landfill as unrecoverable. The overall effect is to
obtain useful power from the mined trash while reducing the volume of the trash by 75
percent. This allows more new trash to be stored at the landfill without increasing the area
required.
Mining of landfills also saves closing costs, which can run into millions of dollars for
even the smallest landfill. Current EPA regulations require a landfill to be monitored for

environmental risks for 30 years after closing. Mining the landfill eliminates the need for
closure while producing moneymaking power and reducing the storage volume needed
for a specific amount of trash. So before soil consolidation tests are made for a landfill,
plans for its possible mining should be reviewed.

SETTLEMENT OF FOOTING

An 8-ft (2.4-m) square footing carries a load of 150 kips (667.2 kN) that may be consid-
ered uniformly distributed, and it is supported by the soil strata shown in Fig. 18. The
silty clay has a compression index of 0.274; its void ratio prior to application of the load
is 84 percent. Applying the unit weights indicated in Fig. 18, calculate the settlement of
the footing caused by consolidation of the silty clay.

Calculation Procedure:

1. Compute the vertical stress at middepth before and after
application of the load

To simplify the calculations, assume that the load is transmitted through a truncated pyra-
mid having side slopes of 2 to 1 and that the stress is uniform across a horizontal plane.
Take the stress at middepth of the silty-clay stratum as the average for that stratum.
Compute the vertical stress (T1 and (T2 at middepth before and after application of the
load, respectively. Thus: (T1 = 6(116) + 12(64) + 7(60) = 1884 lb/ft2 (90.21 kPa); (T2 =
1884 + 150,000/332 = 2022 lb/ft2 (96.81 kPa).

DETERMINATION OF FOOTING SIZE
BY HOUSEL'S METHOD

A square footing is to transmit a load of 80 kips (355.8 kN) to a cohesive soil, the settle-
ment being restricted to 5A in (15.9 mm). Two test footings were loaded at the site until
the settlement reached this value. The results were

34,500 (153,456.0)

Applying House!'s method, determine the size of the footing in plan.

Calculation Procedure:
1. Determine the values of p and s corresponding to the allowable
settlement

Housel considers that the ability of a cohesive soil to support a footing stems from two
sources: bearing strength and shearing strength. This concept is embodied in

W = Ap +Ps 

(34)

where W = total load; A = area of contact surface; P = perimeter of contact surface; p =
bearing stress directly below footing; s = shearing stress along perimeter.
Applying the given data for the test footings gives: footing 1, A = 3 ft2 (2787 cm2),
P = 1 ft (2.1 m); footing 2, A = 9 ft2 (8361 cm2), P = 12 ft (3.7 m). Then 3>p + Is = 14,200;
9p + Us = 34,500; p = 2630 lb/ft2 (125.9 kPa); s = 900 Ib/lin ft (13,134.5 N/m).

2. Compute the size of the footing to carry the specified load

Let jc denote the side of the footing. Then, 263Ox2 + 900(4*) = 80,000; x = 4.9 ft (1.5 m).
Make the footing 5 ft (1.524 m) square.

APPLICATION OF PILE-DRIVING FORMULA

A 16 x 16 in (406.4 x 406.4 mm) pile of 3000-lb/m2 (20,685-kPa) concrete, 45 ft (13.7 m)
long, is reinforced with eight no. 7 bars. The pile is driven by a double-acting steam ham-
mer. The weight of the ram is 4600 Ib (20,460.8 N), and the energy delivered is 17,000
ft-lb (23,052 J) per blow. The average penetration caused by the final blows is 0.42 in

(10.668 mm). Compute the bearing capacity of the pile by applying Redtenbacker's for-
mula and using a factor of safety of 3.

Calculation Procedure:
1. Find the weight of the pile and the area of
the transformed section

The work performed in driving a pile into the soil is a function of the reaction of the soil
on the pile and the properties of the pile. Therefore, the soil reaction may be evaluated if
the work performed by the hammer is known. Let A = cross-sectional area of pile; E =
modulus of elasticity; h = height of fall of ram; L = length of pile; P = allowable load on
pile; R — reaction of soil on pile; s = penetration per blow; W= weight of falling ram; w =
weight of pile.
Redtenbacker developed the following equation by taking these quantities into consid-
eration: the work performed by the soil in bringing the pile to rest; the work performed in
compressing the pile; and the energy delivered to the pile:

R2L 
W2H
RS+ 2AE=W^ 

(35)

Finding the weight of the pile and the area of the transformed section, we get w =
16(16) (0.150)(45)/144 = 12 kips (53.4 kN). The area of a no. 7 bar = 0.60 m2 (3.871
cm2); n = 9; A = 16(16) + 8(9 - 1)0.60 = 294 m2 (1896.9 cm2).

2. Apply Eq. 191 to find R; evaluate P

Thus, s = 0.42 in (10.668 mm); L = 540 in (13,716 mm); Ec = 3160 kips/m2 (21,788.2
MPa.); W= 4.6 kips (20.46 kN); Wh = 17 ft-kips = 204 in-kips (23,052 J). Substituting
gives QA2R + 540#V[2(294)(3160)] = 4.6(204)7(4.6 + 12); R = 84.8 kips (377.19 kN);
P = RfI = 28.3 kips (125.88 kN).

CAPACITY OF A GROUP OF FRICTION PILES

A structure is to be supported by 12 friction piles of 10-in (254-mm) diameter. These will
be arranged in four rows of three piles each at a spacing of 3 ft (91.44 cm) in both direc-
tions. A test pile is found to have an allowable load of 32 kips (142.3 kN). Determine the
load that may be carried by this pile group.

Calculation Procedure:
1. State a suitable equation for the load

When friction piles are compactly spaced, the area of soil that is needed to support an in-
dividual pile overlaps that needed to support the adjacent ones. Consequently, the capaci-
ty of the group is less than the capacity obtained by aggregating the capacities of the indi-
vidual piles. Let P = capacity of group; Pi = capacity of single pile; m = number of rows;
n = number of piles per row; d = pile diameter; s = center-to-center spacing of piles; B =
tan"1 dls deg. A suitable equation using these variables is the Converse-Labarre equation

T.=mn~ (w)[m(n ~1} + n(m ~1 )] 

(36)

2. Compute the load

Thus P1 = 32 kips (142.3 kN); m = 4; n = 3; d = 10 in (254 mm); s = 36 in (914.4 mm);
6 = tan-1 10/36 = 15.5°. Then P/32 =12- (15.5/90)(4 x 2 + 3 x 3); P = 290 kips (1289.9
kN).

LOAD DISTRIBUTION AMONG HINGED
BATTER PILES

Figure 19a shows the relative positions of four steel bearing piles that carry the indicated
load. The piles, which may be considered as hinged at top and bottom, have identical
cross sections and the following relative effective lengths: A9 1.0; B, 0.95; C, 0.93; Z),
1.05. Outline a graphical procedure for determining the load transmitted to each pile.

(b) Force polygon

(c) Construct ion to locate action line of H0
FIGURE 19

Calculation Procedure:
1. Subject the structure to a load for purposes of analysis

Steel and timber piles may be considered to be connected to the concrete pier by friction-
less hinges, and bearing piles that extend a relatively short distance into compact soil may
be considered to be hinge-supported by the soil.
Since four unknown quantities are present, the structure is statically indeterminate. A
solution to this problem therefore requires an analysis of the deformation of the structure.
As the load is applied, the pier, assumed to be infinitely rigid, rotates to some new po-
sition. This displacement causes each pile to rotate about its base and to undergo an axial
strain. The contraction or elongation of each pile is directly proportional to the perpendi-
cular distance/? from the axis of rotation to the longitudinal axis of that pile. Let P denote
the load induced in the pile. Then P = AL AEIL. Since AL is proportional to p and AE is
constant for the group, this equation may be transformed to

kp
P= f 

(37)

where A: is a constant of proportionality.
If the center of rotation is established, the pile loads may therefore be found by scaling
the p distances. Westergaard devised a simple graphical method of locating the center of
rotation. This method entails the construction of string polygons, described in the first
calculation procedure of this handbook.
In Fig. 190 select any convenient point a on the action line of the load. Consider the
structure to be subjected to a load Ha that causes the pier to rotate about a as a center. The
object is to locate the action line of this hypothetical load.
It is often desirable to visualize that a load is applied to a body at a point that in reality
lies outside the body. This condition becomes possible if the designer annexes to the body
an infinitely rigid arm containing the given point. Since this arm does not deform, the
stresses and strains in the body proper are not modified.

2. Scale the perpendicular distance from a to the longitudinal axis
of each pile; divide this distance by the relative length of the pile

In accordance with Eq. 37, the quotient represents the relative magnitude of the load in-
duced in the pile by the load Ha. If rotation is assumed to be counterclockwise, piles A and
B are in compression and D is in tension.

3. Using a suitable scale, construct the force polygon

This polygon is shown in Fig. I9b. Construct this polygon by applying the results ob-
tained in step 2. This force polygon yields the direction of the action line of H0.

4. In Fig. 19b, select a convenient pole O and draw rays to the
force polygon
5. Construct the string polygon shown in Fig. 19c

The action line of H0 passes through the intersection point Q of rays ah and dh, and its di-
rection appears in Fig. 19b. Draw this line.

6. Select a second point on the action line of the load

Choose point b on the action line of the 150-kip (667.2-kN) load, and consider the struc-
ture to be subjected to a load Hb that causes the pier to rotate about b as center.

7. Locate the action line of Hb

Repeat the foregoing procedure to locate the action line of Hb in Fig. 19c. (The construc-
tion has been omitted for clarity.) Study of the diagram shows that the action lines of Ha
and Hb intersect at M.

8. Test the accuracy of the construction

Select a third point c on the action line of the 150-kip (667.2-kN) load, and locate the ac-
tion line of the hypothetical load H0 causing rotation about c. It is found that Hc also pass-
es through M. In summary, these hypothetical loads causing rotation about specific points
on the action line of the true load are all concurrent.
Thus, M is the center of rotation of the pier under the 150-kip (667.2-kN) load. This
conclusion stems from the following analysis: Load Ha applied at M causes zero deflec-
tion at a. Therefore, in accordance with Maxwell's theorem of reciprocal deflections, if
the true load is applied at a, it will cause zero deflection at M in the direction offfa. Simi-
larly, if the true load is applied at b, it will cause zero deflection at M in the direction of
Hb. Thus, Mremains stationary under the 150-kip (667.2-kN) load; that is, Mis the center
of rotation of the pier.

9. Scale the perpendicular distance from M to the longitudinal
axis of each pile

Divide this distance by the relative length of the pile. The quotient represents the relative
magnitude of the load induced in the pile by the 150-kip (667.2-kN) load.

10. Using a suitable scale, construct the force polygon by
applying the results from step 9

If the work is accurate, the resultant of these relative loads is parallel to the true load.

11. Scale the resultant; compute the factor needed to correct this
value to 150 k/ps (667.2 kN)
12. Multiply each relative pile load by this correction factor to
obtain the true load induced in the pile

LOAD DISTRIBUTION AMONG PILES WITH
FIXED BASES

Assume that the piles in Fig. I9a penetrate a considerable distance into a compact soil
and may therefore be regarded as restrained against rotation at a certain level. Outline a
procedure for determining the axial load and bending moment induced in each pile.

Calculation Procedure:
1. State the equation for the length of a dummy pile

Since the Westergaard construction presented in the previous calculation procedure ap-
plies solely to hinged piles, the group of piles now being considered is not directly
amenable to analysis by this method.
As shown in Fig. 2Oa, the pile AB functions in the dual capacity of a column and can-
tilever beam. In Fig. 2OZ?, let A' denote the position of A following application of the load.
If secondary effects are disregarded, the axial force P transmitted to this pile is a function
of Ay, and the transverse force S is a function of Ax.
Consider that the fixed support at B is replaced with a hinged support and a pile AC of
identical cross section is added perpendicular to AB, as shown in Fig. 2OZ?. If pile AC de-
forms an amount Ax under an axial force S, the forces transmitted by the pier at each point
of support are not affected by this modification of supports. The added pile is called a
dummy pile. Thus, the given pile group may be replaced with an equivalent group consist-
ing solely of hinged piles.

FIGURE 20. Real and dummy piles.

Stating the equation for the length L' of the dummy pile, equate the displacement Ax in
the equivalent pile group to that in the actual group. Or, Ax = SL'IAE = SL3/SEL

2. Replace all fixed supports in the given pile group with
hinged supports

Add the dummy piles. Compute the lengths of these piles by applying Eq. 38.

3. Determine the axial forces induced in the equivalent pile group

Using the given load, apply Westergaards construction, as described in the previous cal-
culation procedure.

4. Remove the dummy piles; restore the fixed supports

Compute the bending moments at these supports by applying the equation M= SL.

LOAD DISTRIBUTION AMONG PILES FIXED
AT TOP AND BOTTOM

Assume that the piles in Fig. 19a may be regarded as having fixed supports both at the
pier and at their bases. Outline a procedure for determining the axial load and bending
moment induced in each pile.

Calculation Procedure:
1. Describe how/ dummy piles may be used

A pile made of reinforced concrete and built integrally with the pier is restrained against
rotation relative to the pier. As shown in Fig. 19c, the fixed supports of pile AB may be re-
placed with hinges provided that dummy piles AC and DE are added, the latter being con-
nected to the pier by means of a rigid arm through D.

2. Compute the lengths of the dummy piles

IfD is placed at the lower third point as indicated, the lengths to be assigned to the dum-
my piles are

Replace the given group of piles with its equivalent group, and follow the method of solu-
tion in the previous calculation procedure.

Economics of Cleanup Methods in Soil Mechanics

Many tasks in soil mechanics are hindered by polluted soil which must be cleaned before
foundations, tunnels, sluiceways, or other structures can be built. Four procedures pre-
sented here give the economics and techniques currently used to clean contaminated soil
sites. While there are numerous rules and regulations governing soil cleaning, these pro-
cedures will help the civil engineer understand the approaches being used today. With the
information presented in these procedures the civil engineer should be able to make an in-
telligent choice of a feasible cleanup method. And the first procedure gives the economics
of not polluting the soil—i.e., recycling polluting materials for profit. Such an approach
may be the ultimate answer to soil redmediation—preventing polution before it starts, us-
ing the profit potential as the motivating force for a "clean" planet.

Municipal waste may be classed in several categories: (1) newspapers, magazines, and
other newsprint; (2) corrugated cardboard; (3) plastic jugs and bottles—clear or colored;
(4) copper wire and pipe. Other wastes, such as steel pipe, discarded internal combus-
tion engines, electric motors, refrigerators, air conditioners, etc., require specialized han-
dling and are not generated in quantities as large as the four numbered categories. For

this reason, they are not normally included in estimates of municipal wastes for a given
locality.
For the four categories of wastes listed above, the percentage price increases in one
year for an Eastern city in the United States were as follows: Category 1—newspaper:
Percentage price increase = 100(current price, $ - last year's price, $)/last year's price, $.
Or 100(150 - 60)760 = 150 percent. Category 2: Percentage price increase = 100(150 -
18)718 = 733 percent. Category 3: Percentage price increase = 100(600 - 125)7125 = 380
percent. Category 4: Percentage price increase = 100(1200 - 960)7960 = 25 percent.

2. Determine the profit potential of the wastes considered

Profit potential is a function of collection costs and landfill savings. When collection of
several wastes can be combined to use a single truck or other transport means, the profit
potential can be much higher than when more than one collection method must be used.
Let's assume that a city can collect Category 1, newspapers, and Category 3, plastic, in
one vehicle. The profit potential, P, will be: P = (sales price of the materials to be recy-
cled, $ per ton - cost per ton to collect the materials for recycling, $). With a cost of $80
per ton for collection, the profit for collecting 75 tons of Category 1 wastes would be P =
75($150 - $80) = $5250. For collecting 90 tons of Category 3 wastes, the profit would be
P = 90($600-80) = $46,800.
Where landfill space is saved by recycling waste, the dollar saving can be added to the
profit. Thus, assume that landfill space and handling costs are valued at $30 per ton. The
profit on Category 1 waste would rise by 75($3O) = $2250, while the profit on Category 3
wastes would rise by 90($30) = $2700. When collection is included in the price paid for
municipal wastes, the savings can be larger because the city or town does not have to use
its equipment or personnel to collect the wastes. Hence, if collection can be included in a
waste recycling contract the profits to the municipality can be significant. However, even
when the municipality performs the collection chore, the profit from selling waste for re-
cycling can still be high. In some cities the price of used newspapers is so high that gangs
steal the bundles of papers from sidewalks before they are collected by the city trucks.
Related Calculations. Recyclers are working on ways to reuse almost all the
ordinary waste generated by residents of urban areas. Thus, telephone books, magazines,
color-printed advertisements, waxed milk jars, etc. are now being recycled and converted
into useful products. The environmental impact of these activities is positive throughout.
Thus, landfill space is saved because the recycled products do not enter landfill; instead
they are remanufactured into other useful products. Indeed, in many cases, the energy re-
quired to reuse waste is less than the energy needed to produce another product for use in
place of the waste.
Some products are better recycled in other ways. Thus, the United States discards, ac-

cording to industry records, over 12 million computers a year. These computers, weighing
an estimated 600 million pounds (272 million kg) contribute toxic waste to landfills. Bet-
ter that these computers be contributed to schools, colleges, and universities where they
can be put to use in student training. Such computers may be slower and less modern than
today's models, but their value in training programs has little to do with their speed or
software. Instead, they will enable students to learn, at minimal cost to the school, the
fundamentals of computer use in their personal and business lives.
Recycling waste products has further benefits for municipalities. The U.S. Clean Air
Act's Title V consolidates all existing air pollution regulations into one massive operating
permit program. Landfills that burn, pollute the atmosphere. And most of the waste we're
considering in this procedure burns when deposited in a landfill. By recycling this waste
the hazardous air pollutants they may have produced while burning in a landfill are elimi-
nated from the atmosphere. This results in one less worry and problem for the municipal-
ity and its officials. In a recent year, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency took 2247
enforcement actions and levied some $165-million in civil penalties and criminal fines
against violators.
Any recycling situation can be reduced to numbers because you basically have the
cost of collection balanced against the revenue generated by sale of the waste. Beyond
this are nonfinancial considerations related to landfill availability and expected life-span.
If waste has to be carted to another location for disposal, the cost of carting can be fac-
tored into the economic study of recycling.
Municipalities using waste collection programs state that their streets and sidewalks
are cleaner. They attribute the increased cleanliness to the organization of people's think-
ing by the waste collection program. While stiff fines may have to be imposed on non-
complying individuals, most cities report a high level of compliance from the first day of
the program. The concept of the "green city" is catching on and people are willing to sep-
arate their trash and insert it in specific containers to comply with the law.
"Green products, i.e., those that produce less pollution, are also strongly favored by
the general population of the United States today. Manufacturing companies are finding a
greater sales acceptance for their "green" products. Even automobile manufacturers are
stating the percentage of each which is recyclable, appealing to the "green" thinking per-
meating the population.
Recent studies show that every ton of paper not landfilled saves 3 yd3 (2.3 m3) of land-
fill space. Further, it takes 95 percent less energy to manufacture new products from recy-
cled materials. Both these findings are strong motivators for recycling of waste materials
by all municipalities and industrial firms.
Decorative holiday trees are being recycled by many communities. The trees are
chipped into mulch which are given to residents and used by the community in parks,
recreation areas, hiking trails, and landfill cover. Seaside communities sometimes plant
discarded holiday trees on beaches to protect sand dunes from being carried away by the
sea.

CHOICE OF CLEANUP TECHNOLOGY
FOR CONTAMINATED WASTE SITES

A contaminated waste site contains polluted water, solid wastes, dangerous metals, and
organic contaminants. Evaluate the various treatment technologies available for such a
site and the relative cost of each. Estimate the landfill volume required if the rate of solid-
waste generation for the site is 1,500,000 Ib (681,818 kg) per year. What land area will be

required for this waste generation rate if the landfill is designed for the minimum recom-
mended depth of fill? Determine the engineer's role in site cleanup and in the economic
studies needed for evaluation of available alternatives.

Calculation Procedure:
1. Analyze the available treatment technologies for cleaning
contaminated waste sites

Table 3 lists 13 available treatment technologies for cleaning contaminated waste sites,
along with the type of contamination for which each is applicable, and the relative cost of
the technology. This tabulation gives a bird's eye view of technologies the engineer can
consider for any waste site cleanup.
When approaching any cleanup task, the first step is to make a health-risk assessment
to determine if any organisms are exposed to compounds on, or migrating from, a site. If
there is such an exposure, determine whether the organisms could suffer any adverse
health effects. The results of a health-risk assessment can be used to determine whether
there is sufficient risk at a site to require remediation.
This same assessment of risks to human health and the environment can also be used
to determine a target for the remediation effort that reduces health and environmental
risks to acceptable levels. It is often possible to negotiate with regulatory agencies a re-
mediation level for a site based on the risk of exposure to both a maximum concentration
of materials and a weighted average. The data in Table 2 are useful for starting a site
cleanup having the overall goals of protecting human health and the environment.

2. Make a health-risk assessment of the site to determine
cleanup goals1

Divide the health-risk assessment into these four steps: (1) Hazard Identification—Asks
"Does the facility or site pose sufficient risk to require further investigation?" If the an-
swer is Yes, then: (a) Select compounds to include in the assessment; (b) Identify exposed
populations; (c) Identify exposure pathways.
(2) Exposure Assessment—Asks "To how much of a compound are people and the en-
vironment exposed?" For exposure to occur, four events must happen: (a) release; (b)
contact; (c) transport; (d) absorption. Taken together, these four events form an exposure
pathway. There are many possible exposure pathways for a facility or site.
(3) Toxicity Assessment—Asks "What adverse health effects in humans are potentially
caused by the compounds in question?" This assessment reviews the threshold and non-
threshold effects potentially caused by the compounds at the environmental concentration
levels.
(4) Risk Characterization—Asks "At the exposures estimated in the Exposure Assess-
ment, is there potential for adverse health effects to occur; if so, what kind and to what ex-
tent?" The Risk Characterization develops a hazard index for threshold effects and esti-
mates the excess lifetime cancer-risk for carcinogens.

3. Select suitable treatment methods and estimate the
relative costs

The site contains polluted water, solid wastes, dangerous metals, and organic contami-
nants. Of these four components, the polluted water is the simplest to treat. Hence, we
will look at the other contaminants to see how they might best be treated. As Table 3

shows, thermal desorption treats volatile and semivolatile organics and volatile metals;
cost is medium to high. Alternatively, incineration handles organic wastes and metals
with an ash residue; cost is high. Nonhazardous solid wastes can be landfilled at low cost.
But the future cost may be much higher because landfill costs are rising as available land
becomes scarcer.
Polluted water can be treated with chemicals, aeration, or air stripping—all at low
cost. None of these methods can be combined with the earlier tentative choices. Hence,
the polluted water will have to be treated separately.

4. Determine the landfill dimensions and other parameters

Annual landfill space requirements can be determined from VA = Wl 1100, where VA -
landfill volume required, per year, yd3 (m3); W= annual weight, Ib (kg) of waste generat-
ed for the landfill; 1100 lb/yd3 (650 kg/m3) = solid waste compaction per yd3 or m3. Sub-
stituting for this site, VA = 1,500,000/1100 = 1363.6 yd3 (1043.2 m3).
The minimum recommended depth for landfills is 20 ft (6 m); minimum recommend-
ed life is 10 years. If this landfill were designed for the minimum depth of 20 ft (6 m), it
would have an annual required area of 1363.6 x 27 fVVyd3 •= 36,817.2 ft3/20 ft high -
1840.8 ft2 (171.0 m2), or 1840.9 ft2/43,560 ft2/acre = 0.042 acre (169.9 m2 0.017 ha) per
year. With a 10-year life the landfill area required to handle solid wastes generated for
this site would be 10 x 0.042 = 0.42 acre (1699.7 m2, 0.17 ha); with a 20-year life the area
required would be 20 x 0.042 = 0.84 acre (3399.3 m2; 0.34 ha).
As these calculations show, the area required for this landfill is relatively modest—
less than an acre with a 20-year life. However, in heavily populated areas the waste gen-
eration could be significantly larger. Thus, when planning a sanitary landfill, the usual as-
sumption is that each person generates 5 Ib (2.26 kg) per day of solid waste. This number
is based on an assumption of half the waste (2.5 Ib; 1.13 kg) being from residential
sources and the other half being from commercial and industrial sources. Hence, in a city
having a population of !-million people, the annual solid-waste generation would be
1,000,000 people x 5 lb/day per person x 355 days per year = 1,825,000,000 Ib
(828,550,000 kg).
Following the same method of calculation as above, the annual landfill space require-
ment would be VA = 1,825,000,000/1100 = 1,659,091 yd3 (1,269,205 m3). With a 20-ft
(6-m) height for the landfill, the annual area required would be 1,659,091 x 27/20 x
43,560 = 51.4 acres (208,002 m2; 20.8 ha). Increasing the landfill height to 40 ft (12 m)
would reduce the required area to 25.7 acres (104,037 m2; 10.4 ha). A 60-ft high landfill
would reduce the required area to 17.1 acres (69,334 m2; 6.9 ha). In densely populated ar-
eas, landfills sometimes reach heights of 100 ft (30.5 m) to conserve horizontal space.
This example graphically shows why landfills are becoming so much more expensive.
Further, with the possibility of air and stream pollution from a landfill, there is greater
regulation of landfills every year. This example also shows why incineration of solid
waste to reduce its volume while generating useful heat is so attractive to communities
and industries. Further advantages of incineration include reduction of the possibility of
groundwater pollution from the landfill and the chance to recover valuable minerals
which can be sold or reused. Residue from incineration can be used in road and highway
construction or for fill in areas needing it.
Related Calculations. Use this general procedure for tentative choices of treat-
ment technologies for cleaning up contaminated waste sites. The greatest risks faced by
industry are where human life is at stake. Penalties are severe where human health is en-
dangered by contaminated wastes. Hence, any expenditures for treatment equipment can
usually be justified by the savings obtained by eliminating lawsuits, judgments, and years
of protracted legal wrangling. A good example is the asbestos lawsuits which have been
in the courts for years.

To show what industry has done to reduce harmful wastes, here are results published
in the Wall Street Journal for the years 1974 and 1993: Lead emissions declined from
223,686 tons in 1973 to 4885 tons in 1993 or to 2.2 percent of the original emissions; car-
bon monoxide emissions for the same period fell from 124.8 million tons to 97.2 million
tons, or 77.9 percent of the original; rivers with fecal coliform above the federal standard
were 31 percent in 1974 and 26 percent in 1994; municipal waste recovered for recycling
was 7.9 percent in 1974 and 22.0 percent in 1994.
The simplest way to dispose of solid wastes is to put them in landfills. This practice
was followed for years, but recent studies show that rain falling on landfilled wastes seeps
through and into the wastes, and can become contaminated if the wastes are harmful.
Eventually, unless geological conditions are ideal, the contaminated rainwater seeps into
the groundwater under the landfill. Once in the groundwater, the contaminants must be
treated before the water can be used for drinking or other household purposes.
Most landfills will have a leachate seepage area, Fig. 21. There may also be a contam-
inant plume, as shown, which reaches, and pollutes, the groundwater. This is why more
and more communities are restricting, or prohibiting, landfills. Engineers are therefore
more pressed than ever to find better, and safer, ways to dispose of contaminated wastes.
And with greater environmental oversight by both Federal and State governments, the
pressure on engineers to find safe, economical treatment methods is growing. The sug-
gested treatments in Table 2 are a good starting point for choosing suitable and safe ways
to handle contaminated wastes of all types.
Landfills must be covered daily. A 6-in (15-cm) thick cover of the compacted refuse is
required by most regulatory agencies and local authorities. The volume of landfill cover,
ft3, required each day can be computed from: (Landfill working face length, ft)(landfill
working width, ft)(0.5). Multiply by 0.0283 to convert to m3. Since the daily cover, usual-
ly soil, must be moved by machinery operated by humans, the cost can be significant
when the landfill becomes high-more than 30 ft (9.1 m). The greater the height of a land-
fill, the more optimal, in general, is the site and its utilization. For this reason, landfills
have grown in height in recent years in many urban areas.

CLEANING UPA CONTAMINATED WASTE
SITE VIA BIOREMEDIATION

Evaluate the economics of cleaning up a 40-acre (161,872 m2) site contaminated with pe-
troleum hydrocarbons, gasoline, and sludge. Estimates show that some 100,000 yd3
(76,500 m3) must be remediated to meet federal and local environmental requirements.
The site has three impoundments containing weathered crude oils, tars, and drilling muds
ranging in concentration from 3800 to 40,000 ppm, as measured by the Environmental
Protection Agency (EPA) Method 8015M. While hydrocarbon concentrations in the soil
are high, tests for flash point, pH, 96-h fish bioassay, show that the soil could be classified
as nonhazardous. Total petroleum hydrocarbons are less than 500 ppm. Speed of treat-
ment is not needed by the owner of the project. Show how to compute the net present val-
ue for the investment in alternative treatment methods for which the parameters are given
in step 4 of this procedure.

Calculation Procedure:
1. Compare the treatment technologies available

A number of treatment technologies are available to remediate such a site. Where total pe-
troleum hydrocarbons are less than 500 ppm, as at this site, biological land treatment is
usually sufficient to meet regulatory and human safety needs. Further, hazardous and
nonhazardous waste cleanup via bioremediation is gaining popularity. One reason is the

high degree of public acceptance of bioremediation vs. alternatives such as incineration.
The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) defines hazardous waste as
specifically listed wastes or as wastes that are characteristically toxic, corrosive, flamma-
ble, or reactive. Wastes at this site fit certain of these categories.
Table 4 compares three biological treatment technologies currently in use. The type of
treatment, and approximate cost, $/ft3 ($/m3), are also given. Since petroleum hydrocar-
bons are less than 500 ppm at this site, biological land treatment will be chosen as the
treatment method.
Looking at the range of costs in Table 4 shows a minimum of $30/yd3 ($39/m3) for
land treatment and a maximum of $250/yd3 ($327/m3) for bioreactor treatment. This is a
ratio of $250/$30 = 8.3:1. Thus, where acceptable results will be obtained, the lowest cost
treatment technology would probably be the most suitable choice.

2. Determine the cost ranges that might be encountered
in this application

The cost ranges that might be encountered in this—or any other application—depend on
the treatment technology which is applicable and chosen. Thus, with some 100,000 yd3
(76,500 m3) of soil to be treated, the cost ranges from Table 4 = 100,000 yd3 x $/yd3. For
biological land treatment, cost ranges = 100,000 x $30 = $3,000,000; 100,000 x $90 =
$9,000,000. For bioventing, cost ranges = 100,000 x $50 = $5,000,000; 100,000 x $120 =
$12,000,000. For biorector treatment, cost ranges = 100,000 x $150 = $15,000,000;
100,000 x $250 = $250,000,000. Thus, a significant overall cost range exists—from
$3,000,000 to $25,000,000, depending on the treatment technology chosen.
The wide cost range computed above shows why it is so important that the engineer
choose the most cost-effective system which accomplishes the desired cleanup in accor-
dance with federal and state requirements. With an estimated 2000 hazardous waste sites
currently known in the United States, and possibly several times that number in the rest of
the world, the potential financial impact on companies and their insurers, is enormous.
The actual waste site discussed in this procedure highlights the financial decisions engi-
neers face when choosing a method of cleanup.
Once a cleanup (or remediation) method is tentatively chosen—after the site investi-
gation and feasibility study by the engineer—the controlling regulatory agencies must be
consulted for approval of the method selected. The planned method of remediation is usu-
ally negotiated with the regulatory agency before final approval is given. Once such ap-
proval is obtained, it is difficult to change the remediation method chosen. Hence, the en-
gineer, and the organization involved, should find the chosen remediation method
acceptable in every way possible.

3. Evaluate the time requirements of each biological
treatment technology

Biological land treatment has been used for many years for treating petroleum residues.
Also known as land-farming, this is the simplest and least expensive biological treatment
technology. However, this method requires large amounts of land that can be dedicated to
the treatment process for a period of several months to several years. Typically, land
treatment involves the control of oxygen, nutrients, and moisture (to optimize microbial
activity) while the soil is tilled or otherwise aerated.
Bioventing systems, Fig. 22, are somewhat more complex than land treatment, at a
moderate increase in cost. They are used on soils with both volatile and nonvolatile hy-
drocarbons. Conventional vapor extraction technology (air stripping) of the volatile com-
ponents is combined with soil conditioning (such as nutrient addition) to enhance micro-
bial degradation. This treatment method can be used both in situ and ex situ. Relative to
land treatment, space requirements are reduced. Treatment time is on the order of weeks
to months.
Bioreactors are the most complex and expensive biological alternative. They can clean
up contaminated water alone, or solids mixed with water (slurry bioreactors). The reactor
can be configured from existing impoundments, aboveground tanks, or enclosed tanks (if
emissions controls are required). Batch, semicontinuous, or continuous modes of opera-
tion can be maintained. The higher cost is often justified by the faster treatment time (on
the order of hours to days) and the ability to degrade contaminants on difficult-to-treat
soil matrices.
Since time is not a controlling factor in this application, biological land treatment, the
least expensive method, will be chosen and applied.

4. Compute the net present value for alternative treatment
methods

Where alternative treatment methods can be used for a hazardous waste site, the method

FIGURE 22. Pipes blowing air from the bottom of this enclosure separate contaminants from
the soil. (OHM Corp., Carla Magazino and Chemical Engineering.)

chosen can be analyzed on the basis of the present net worth of the "cash flows" produced
by each method. Such "cash flows" can be estimated by converting savings in compli-
ance, legal, labor, management, and other costs to "cash flows" for each treatment
method. Determining the net present worth of each treatment method will then provide a
comparative evaluation which will be an additional input in the final treatment choice de-
cision.
The table below shows the estimated annual "cash flows" for two suitable treatment
methods: Method A and Method B

Year

Method B

-$180,000

Interest rate charged on the investment is 12 percent.
Using the Net Present Value (NPV), or Discounted Cash Flow (DCF), equation for
each treatment method gives, NPV, Treatment Method = Investment, first year + each
year's cash flow x capital recovery factor for the interest rate on the investment. For the
first treatment method, using a table of compound interest factors for an interest rate of 12
percent, NPV, treatment A = -$180,000 + $60,000/0.27741 = $36,286. In this relation,
the cash flow for years 1, 2, and 3 repays the investment of $180,000 in the equipment.
Hence, the cash flow for the fourth year is the only one used in the NPV calculation.
For the second treatment method, B, NPV = -$180,000 + $180,000/0.8929 +
$30,000/0.7972 + $18,000/0.7118 + $12,000/0.6355 = $103,392. Since Treatment

Method B is so superior to Treatment Method A, B would be chosen. The ratio of NPV is
2.84 in favor of Method B over Method A.
Use the conventional methods of engineering economics to compare alternative treat-
ment methods. The prime consideration is that the methods compared provide equivalent
results for the remediation process.

5. Develop costs for combined remediation systems

Remediation of sites always involves evaluation of a diverse set of technologies. While
biological treatment alone can be used for the treatment of many waste streams, combin-
ing bioremediation with other treatment technologies may provide a more cost-effective
remedial alternative.
Figure 23 shows the costs of a full-scale groundwater treatment system treating 120
gal/min (7.6 L/s) developed for a site contaminated with pentachlorophenol (PCP), cre-
osote, and other wood-treating chemicals at a forest-products manufacturing plant. The
site contained contaminated groundwater, soil, and sludges. Capital cost, prorated for the
life of the project, for the biological unit is twice that of an activated carbon system. How-
ever, the lower operating cost of the biological system results in a total treatment cost half
the price of its nearest competitor. Carbon polishing adds 13 percent to the base cost.
For the systems discussed in the paragraph above, the choice of alternative treatment
technologies was based on two factors: (1) Biological treatment followed by acti-
vated carbon polishing may be required to meet governmental discharge requirements.
(2) Liquid-phase activated carbon, and UV-oxidation are well established treatment meth-
ods for contaminated groundwater.
Soils and sludges in the forest-products plant discussed above are treated using a
bioslurry reactor. The contaminated material is slurried with water and placed into a
mixed, aerated biotreatment unit where suspended bacteria degrade the contaminants.

FIGURE 23. Under the right circum-
stances, biological treatment can be the
lowest-cost option 
for groundwater
cleanup. (Carlo, Magazine and Chemical
Engineering)

Observation of the short-term degradation of PCP in initial tests suggested that the major-
ity of the degradation occurred in the first 10 to 30 days of treatment. These results sug-
gested that treatment costs could be minimized by initial processing of soils in the slurry
bioreactor followed by final treatment in an engineered land-farm.
Treatment costs for a bioslurry reactor system using a 30-day batch time, followed by
land treatment, are shown in Fig. 24. The minimum cost, $62/ton, occurs with a 5-year re-
mediation lifetime, Fig. 24. An equivalent system using only the bioreactor would require
an 80+-day cycle time to reach the cleanup criteria. The treatment cost can be reduced by
over $45/ton using the hybrid system.
Note that the costs given above are for a specific installation. While they are not appli-
cable to all plants, the cost charts show how comparisons can be made and how treatment
costs vary with various cleanup methods. You can assemble, and compare, costs for vari-
ous treatment methods using this same approach.
Related Calculations. Bioremediation works because it uses naturally occur-
ring microorganisms or consortia of microorganisms that degrade specific pollutants and,
more importantly, classes of pollutants. Biological studies reveal degradation pathways
essential to assure detoxification and mineralization. These studies also show how to en-
hance microbial activity, such as by the addition of supplementary oxygen and nutrients,
and the adjustment of pH, temperature, and moisture.
Bioremediation can be effective as a pre- or post-treatment step for other cleanup tech-
niques. Degradation of pollutants by microorganisms requires a carbon source, electron
hydrocarbons (PAHs) found in coal tar, creosote, and some petroleum-compounds accep-
tor, nutrients, and appropriate pH, moisture, and temperature. The waste can be the car-
bon source or primary substrate for the organisms. Certain waste streams may also require
use of a cosubstrate to trigger the production of enzymes necessary to degrade the pri-
mary substrate. Some wastes can be cometabolized directly along with the primary sub-
strate.

FIGURE 24. The treatment cost for this sys-
tem reaches a minimum value after 5 years,
then rises again. (Carla Magazino and Chemi-
cal Engineering^)

Regulatory constraints are perhaps the most important factor in selecting bioremedia-
tion as a treatment process. Regulations that define specific cleanup criteria, such as land
disposal restrictions under the U.S. Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA),
also restrict the types of treatment technologies to be used. Other technologies, such as in-
cineration, have been used to define the "best demonstrated available technology"
(BDAT) for hazardous waste treatment of listed wastes.
The schedule for a site cleanup can also be driven by regulatory issues. A consent de-
cree may fix the timetable for a site remediation, which may eliminate the use of bioreme-
diation, or limit the application to a specific biological treatment technology.
Specific cleanup tasks for which biological treatment is suitable include remediation
of petroleum compounds (gasoline, diesel, bunker oil); polynuclear aromatic hydrocar-
bons (PAHs) found in coal tar, creosote, and some petroleum compounds; soils with
volatile and nonvolatile hydrocarbons; contaminated water; drilling muds; polychlorinat-
ed biphenyls (PCBs). The general approach given here can be used for the named pollu-
tants, plus others amenable to bioremediation.

Remediation Services Corp., Douglas B. Jerger, Technical Director, Bioremediation,

step 4 of this procedure were prepared by the Handbook editor,
David R. Hopper, Chemical Process Engineering Program Manager, ENSR Consult-
ing and Engineering, writing in Chemical Engineering magazine, notes that:

Many of today's contaminated sites are the result of accepted and lawful waste-disposal prac-
tices of years ago. While the methods of disposal have improved and the regulations prevent-
ing disposal techniques that might result in future contamination are in place, there is no
guarantee that today's landfilled wastes will not end up being remediated in coming years. In
addition, the new regulations and technologies have come at a time of increased disposal cost
and ever-diminishing landfill capacity.
Waste minimization, or pollution prevention, is one way of avoiding the whole disposal
problem, and its associated long-term liability. By reducing the creation of waste by the man-
ufacturing process, or recovering and recycling potential wastes between processes, the
amount of waste to be disposed of is r edu c ed . . ..
Pollution prevention programs are gaining momentum at both the federal and state levels.
Several states (e.g. Texas and New Jersey) have introduced legislation aimed at promoting
waste reduction. Federal agencies (e.g. EPA, Department of Defense, Department of Energy,
and Department of Interior) are actively supporting research and development of waste-mini-
mization methods. However, the major driving force remains the economic benefits of reduc-
ing the amount of waste produced. Savings in raw materials and avoidance of the disposal
costs result in attractive returns on investment for waste-minimizing process improvements.
Between the potential savings and the future regulatory focus, waste minimization is likely to
be an active, and beneficial, aspect of future waste-management programs.

WORK REQUIRED TO CLEAN OIL-POLLUTED
BEACHES

How much relative work is required to clean a 300-yd (274-m) long beach coated with
heavy oil, if the width of the beach is 40 yd (36.6 m), the depth of oil penetration is 20 in
(50.8 cm), the beach terrain is gravel and pebbles, the oil coverage is 60 percent of the
beach, and the beach contains heavy debris?

Calculation Procedure:
1. Establish a work-measurement equation from a beach model

After the Exxon Valdez ran aground on Bligh Reef in Prince William Sound, a study was
made to develop a model and an equation that would give the relative amount of work
needed to rid a beach of spilled oil. The relative amount of work remaining, expressed in
clydes, is defined as the amount of work required to clean 100 yd (91.4 m) of lightly pol-
luted beach. As the actual cleanup progressed, the actual work required was found to
agree closely with the formula-predicted relative work indicated by the model and equa-
tion that were developed.
The work-measurement equation, developed by on-the-scene Commander Peter C.
Olsen, U.S. Coast Guard Reserve, and Commander Wayne R. Hamilton, U.S. Coast
Guard, is S = (LfIOO)(EWPTCD), where S = standardized equivalent beach work units,
expressed in clydes; L = beach-segment length in yards or meters (considered equivalent
because of the rough precision of the model); E = degree of contamination of the beach
expressed as: light oil = 1; moderate oil = 1.5; heavy oil = 2; random tar balls and very
light oil = 0.1; W= width of beach expressed as: less than 3 O m= 1; 30 to 45 m = 1.5;
more than 45 m = 2; P = depth of penetration of the oil expressed as: less than 10 cm = 1;
10 to 20 cm = 2; more than 30 cm = 3; T= terrain of the beach expressed as: boulders,
cobbles, sand, mud, solid rock without vertical faces = 1; gravel/pebbles = 2; solid rock
faces = 0.1; C = percent of oil coverage of the beach expressed as: more than 67 percent
coverage = 1; 50 to 67 percent = 0.8; less than 50 percent = 0.5; D = debris factor ex-
pressed as: heavy debris =1 .2; all others = 1.

2. Determine the relative work required

Using the given conditions, S = (300/100)(2 x 1.5 x 1 x 1 x 0.8 x 1.2) = 8.64 clydes. This
shows that the work required to clean this beach would be some 8.6 times that of cleaning
100 yd of lightly oiled beach. Knowing the required time input to clean the "standard"
beach (100 yd, lightly oiled), the approximate time to clean the beach being considered
can be obtained by simple multiplication. Thus, if the cleaning time for the standard light-
ly oiled beach is 50 h, the cleaning time for the beach considered here would be 50 (8.64)
= 432 h.
Related Calculations: The model presented here outlines—in general—the proce-
dure to follow to set up an equation for estimating the working time to clean any type of
beach of oil pollution. The geographic location of the beach will not in general be a factor
in the model unless the beach is in cold polar regions. In cold climates more time will be
required to clean a beach because the oil will congeal and be difficult to remove.
A beach cleanup in Prince William Sound was defined as eliminating all gross
amounts of oil, all migratory oil, and all oil-contaminated debris. This definition is valid
for any other polluted beach be it in Europe, the Far East, the United States, etc.
Floating oil in the marine environment can be skimmed, boomed, absorbed, or other-
wise removed. But oil on a beach must either be released by (1) scrubbing or (2) steaming
and floated to the nearby water where it can be recovered using surface techniques men-
tioned above.
Where light oil—gasoline, naphtha, kerosene, etc.—is spilled in an accident on the
water, it will usually evaporate with little damage to the environment. But heavy oil—No.
6, Bunker C, unrefined products, etc.—will often congeal and stick to rocks, cobbles,
structures, and sand. Washing such oil products off a beach requires the use of steam and
hot high-pressure water. Once the oil is freed from the surfaces to which it is adhering, it
must be quickly washed away with seawater so that it flows to the nearby water where it
can be recovered. Several washings may be required to thoroughly cleanse a badly pollut-
ed beach.

The most difficult beaches to clean are those comprised of gravel, pebbles, or small
boulders. Two reasons for this are: (1) the surface areas to which the oil can adhere are
much greater, and (2) extensive washing of these surface areas is required. This washing
action can carry away the sand and the underlying earth, destroying the beach. When set-
ting up an equation for such a beach, this characteristic should be kept in mind.
Beaches with larger boulders having a moderate slope toward the water are easiest to
clean. Next in ease of cleaning are sand and mud beaches because thick oil does not pen-
etrate deeply in most instances.
Use this equation as is; and check its results against actual cleanup times. Then alter
the equation to suit the actual conditions and personnel met in the cleanup.
The model and equation described here are the work of Commander Peter C. Olsen,
U.S. Coast Guard Reserve and Commander Wayne B. Hamilton, U.S. Coast Guard, as re-
ported in government publications.

3. Find the length and bearing of f

Thus, tan otf= 11.0/53.5; therefore, the bearing off= Sl 1°37'W; length off= 53.5/cos af
= 4.6 ft (16.64m).

4. Complete the layout

Complete Fig. 2 by drawing line d through the upper end of/with the specified bearing
and by drawing a circular arc centered at the lower end of/having a radius equal to the
length of b.

5. Find the length of d and the bearing of b

Solve the triangle fdb to find the length of d and the bearing of b. Thus, B = 73°31' -
11°37' = 61°54'. By the law of sines, sin F -/sin BIb = 54.6 sin 61°54V83.6; F= 35011';

course AB. Let D denote the departure of a course. Then

DMD- = DM IV1+ /V1+ A, 

(3)

where the subscripts refer to two successive courses.
The area of trapezoid ABba, which will be termed the projection area of AB, equals
half the product of the DMD and latitude of the course. A projection area may be either
positive or negative.
Plot the tract in Fig. 4. Since D is the most westerly point, pass the reference meridian
through D, thus causing all DMDs to be positive.

Thus, DMDDE - 143.6 ft (43.77 m); DMD^ = 143.6 + 143.6 + 246.7 = 533.9 ft
(162.73 m); DMD^ = 533.9 + 246.7 + 21.3 - 801.9 ft (244.42 m); DMD45 = 801.9 +
21.3 - 135.6 = 687.6 ft (209.58 m); DMDBC = 687.6 - 135.6 - 77.5 = 474.5 ft (144.62 m);
DMDCD - 474.5 - 77.5 - 198.5 = 198.5 ft (60.50 m). This is acceptable.

3. Calculate the area of the tract

PARTITION OFA TRACT

The tract in the previous calculation procedure is to be divided into two parts by a line
through E, the part to the west of this line having an area of 30,700 ft2 (2852.03 m2). Lo-
cate the dividing line.

Calculation Procedure:

1. Ascertain the location of the dividing line EG

This procedure requires the solution of an oblique triangle. Refer to Fig. 5. It will be nec-
essary to apply the following equations, which may be readily developed by drawing the
altitude BD:

Area = Vibe sin A

In Fig. 6, let EG represent the dividing line of this tract. By scaling the dimensions and
making preliminary calculations or by using a planimeter, ascertain that G lies between B
and C.

2. Establish the properties of the hypothetical course EC

By balancing the latitudes and departures of DEC. latitude of EC = -(+161.9 + 97.9) =
-259.8 ft (-79.18 m); departure of EC = -(+143.6 - 198.5) = +54.9 ft (+16.73 m); length
of EC = (259.S2 + 54.92)05 = 265.5 ft (80.92 m). Then DMDDE = 143.6 ft (43.77 m);

FIGURES 

FIGURE 6. Partition of tract.

DMDEC = 143.6 + 143.6 + 54.9 = 342.1 ft (104.27 m); DMDCD = 342.1 + 54.9 - 198.5 =
198.5 ft (60.50 m). This is acceptable.

3. Determine angle GCE by finding the bearings of courses
EC and BC

Thus tan OLEC = 54.9/259.8; bearing of EC = S11°55.9'E; tan OLBC = 77.5/9.6; bearing of
5C = N82°56.3'W; angle GCE= 180°-(82°56.3' - 11°55.9') = 108°59.6'.

4. Determine the area of triangle GCE

Calculate the area of triangle DEC; then find the area of triangle GCE by subtraction.
Thus

= 7602 ft2 (706.22 m2).

5. Solve triangle GCE completely

Apply Eqs. 4 and 5. To ensure correct substitution, identify the corresponding elements,
making A the known angle GCE and c the known side EC. Thus

By Eq. 4, 7602 = 1/2GC(265.5 sin 108°59.6'); solving gives GC = 60.6 ft (18.47 m). By
Eq. 5, tan EGC = 265.5 sin 108°59.6V(60.6 - 265.5 cos 108°59.6'); EGC = 59°38.8'. By
the law of sines, £G/sin GCE = EC/sin EGO, EG = 291.0 ft (88.70 m); CEG = 180° -
(108°59.6' + 59 °38.8')=11 °21.6'.

6. Find the bearing of course EG

Thus, OLEG = OLEC + CEG = 11°55.9' + 11°21.6' = 23°17.5' bearing of EG = S23°17.5'E.
The surveyor requires the length and bearing of EG to establish this line of demarca-
tion. She or he is able to check the accuracy of both the fieldwork and the office calcula-
tions by ascertaining that the point G established in the field falls on BC and that the
measured length of GC agrees with the computed value.

AREA OF TRACT WITH MEANDERING
BOUNDARY: OFFSETS AT

The offsets below were taken from stations on a traverse line to a meandering stream, all
data being in feet. What is the encompassed area?

Calculation Procedure:

1. Assume a rectilinear boundary between successive offsets;
develop area equations

Refer to Fig. 7. When a tract has a meandering boundary, this boundary is approximated
by measuring the perpendicular offsets of the boundary from a straight line AB. Let dr de-
note the distance along the traverse line between the first and the rth offset, and let /Z1, h2,
..., hn denote the offsets.
Developing the area equations yields

Area = V^d2(H1 - A3) + djfa - A4) + - - • + dn^(hn_2 - hn) + dn(hn^ + /*„)] 

(6)

Or,

Area = Y2[^d2 + h2d3 + h3(d4 - d2) + h4(d5 - J3) + • - - + hn(dn - ^1)] 

(7)

2. Determine the area,
using Eq. 6

Thus, area = 
l/2[25(29.% - 93.2) +
60(64.6 - 58.1) + 75(93.2 - 28.5) +
110(58.1 + 28.5)] = 6590 ft2 (612.2 m2).

3. Determine the area,

Thus, area = ^[29.S x 25 + 64.6 x 60 +

28.5(110 - 75)] = 6590 ft2 (612.2 m2). Hence, both equations yield the same result. The
second equation has a distinct advantage over the first because it has only positive terms.

Calculation Procedure:

1. Obtain the elevation for each point

Differential leveling is used to ascertain the difference in elevation between two succes-
sive benchmarks by finding the elevations of several convenient intermediate points,
called turning points (TP). In Fig. 8, consider that the instrument is set up at Ll and C is
selected as a turning point. The rod reading AB represents the backsight (BS) O fBM1, and
rod reading CD represents the foresight (FS) O fTP1. The elevation of BD represents the
height of instrument (HI). The instrument is then set up at L2, and rod readings CE and
FG are taken. Let a and b designate two successive turning points. Then

Elevationa + BSa = HI

volume of earthwork to be excavated, in cubic yards (cubic meters). Apply both the aver-
age-end-area method and the prismoidal method.

Calculation Procedure:

1. Resolve each section into an isosceles trapezoid and a triangle;
record the relevant dimensions

Let A1 and A2 denote the areas of the end sections, L the intervening distance, and V the
volume of earthwork to be excavated or filled.
Method 1: The average-end-area method equates the average area to the mean of the
two end areas. Then

Compute Am. Note that each coordinate of the center section of a prismoid is the arith-
metic mean of the corresponding coordinates of the end sections. Thus, Am = [30(40 + 70)
+ (36 - 30)70]/2 = 1860 ft2 (172.8 m2).

4. Compute the volume of earthwork

Using Eq. 15 gives V= 100(1504 + 4 x I860 + 2240)/[6(27)] = 6904 yd3 (5278.8 m3).

DETERMINATION OFAZIMUTH OFA STAR
BY FIELD ASTRONOMY

An observation of the sun was made at a latitude of 41 °20'N. The altitude of the center of
the sun, after correction for refraction and parallax, was 46°48'. By consulting a solar

ephemeris, it was found that the declination of the sun at the instant of observation was
7°58'N. What was the azimuth of the sun?

Calculation Procedures:

1. Calculate the azimuth of the body

Refer to Fig. 11. The celestial sphere is an imaginary sphere on the surface of which the
celestial bodies are assumed to be located; this sphere is of infinite radius and has the
earth as its center. The celestial equator, or equinoctial, is the great circle along which the
earth's equatorial plane intersects the celestial sphere. The celestial axis is the prolonga-
tion of the earth's axis of rotation. The celestial poles are the points at which the celestial
axis pierces the celestial sphere. An hour circle, or a meridian, is a great circle that passes
through the celestial poles.
The zenith and nadir of an observer are the points at which the vertical (plumb) line at
the observer's site pierces the celestial sphere, the former being visible and the latter in-
visible to the observer. A vertical circle is a great circle that passes through the observer's
zenith and nadir. The observer's meridian is the meridian that passes through the observ-
er's zenith and nadir; it is both a meridian and a vertical circle.
In Fig. 11, P is the celestial pole, S is the apparent position of a star on the celestial
sphere, and Z is the observer's zenith.
The coordinates of a celestial body relative to the observer are the azimuth, which is
the angular distance from the observer's meridian to the vertical circle through the body
as measured along the observer's horizon in a clockwise direction; and the altitude, which
is the angular distance of the body from the observer's horizon as measured along a verti-
cal circle.
The absolute coordinates of a celestial body are the right ascension, which is the an-
gular distance between the vernal equinox and the hour circle through the body as meas-

ured along the celestial equator; and the declination, which is the angular distance of the
body from the celestial equator as measured along an hour circle.
The relative coordinates of a body at a given instant are obtained by observation; the
absolute coordinates are obtained by consulting an almanac of astronomical data. The lat-
itude of the observer's site equals the angular distance of the observer's zenith from the
celestial equator as measured along the meridian. In the astronomical triangle PZS in Fig.
11, the arcs represent the indicated coordinates, and angle Z represents the azimuth of the
body as measured from the north.
Calculating the azimuth of the body yields

where L = latitude of site; h = altitude of star; p = polar distance = 90 ° - declination; S =

TfME OF CULMINATION OFA STAR

Determine the Eastern Standard Time (75th meridian time) of the upper culmination of
Polaris at a site having a longitude 810W of Greenwich. Reference to an almanac shows
that the Greenwich Civil Time (GCT) of upper culmination for the date of observation is
3h20mQ5s

Calculation Procedure:

1. Convert the longitudes to the hour-minute-second system

The rotation of the earth causes a star to appear to describe a circle on the celestial sphere
centered at the celestial axis. The star is said to be at culmination or transit when it ap-
pears to cross the observer's meridian.

In Fig. 12, P and M represent the po-
sition of Polaris and the mean sun, re-
spectively, when Polaris is at the Green-
wich meridian, and P' and M' represent
the position of these bodies when Polaris
is at the observer's meridian. The dis-
tances h and h' represent, respectively,
the time of culmination of Polaris at
Greenwich and at the observer's site,
measured from local noon. Since the ap-
parent velocity of the mean sun is less
than that of the stars, h' is less than h, the
difference being approximately 10 s/h of
longitude.
By converting the longitudes, 360°
corresponds to 24 h; therefore, 15 ° corre-
sponds to 1 h. Longitude of site = 81 ° =
54 /, = 5^4"W; standard longitude =
75° = 5h.

2. Calculate the time of upper culmination at the site

Correct this result to Eastern Standard Time. Since the standard meridian is east of the ob-
server's meridian, the standard time is greater. Thus

(c) Calculate all the data necessary to stake the curve if the arc distance between succes-
sive stations is to be 100 ft (30.5 m).

Calculation Procedure:

1. Determine the geometric properties of the curve

Part a. Refer to Fig. 13: A is termed the point of curve (PC), B is the point of tangent (PT),
and V the point of intersection (PI), or vertex. The notational system is A = intersection
angle = angle between back and forward tangents = central angle AOB; R = radius of
curve; T = tangent distance = AV= VB; C = long chord = AB; M = middle ordinate = DC;
E = external distance = CV.
From the geometric relationships,

Also

T = R tan 1M 
T = 1200(0.2493) = 299.2 ft (91.20 m)

C = 21 I Sm1M 
C = 2(1200)(0.2419) = 580.6 ft (176.97 m)

(19)

(20)

FIGURE 13. Circular curve.

And,

Lastly,

M = ^ ( I - CO s1X2A) 
M = 1200(1 - 0.9703) = 35.6 ft (10.85 m)

E = R tan 1X2A tan 1X2A 
E= 1200(0.2493)(0.1228) = 36.7 ft (11.19 m)

(21)

(22)

2. Verify the results in step 1

Use the pythagorean theorem on triangle ADV. Or, AD = !/2(580.6) = 290.3 ft (88.48 m);
DV- 35.6 + 36.7 = 72.3 ft (22.04 m); then 290.32 + 72.32 = 89,500 ft2 (8314.6 m2), to the
nearest hundred; 299.22 = 89,500 ft2 (8314.6 m2); this is acceptable.

3. Calculate the degree of curve D

Part b. In Fig. 13, let E represent a station along the curve. Angle VAE is termed the de-
flection angle oe of this station; it is equal to one-half the central angle AOE. In the field,
the curve is staked by setting up the transit at the PC and then locating each station by
means of its deflection angle and its chord distance from the preceding station.
Calculate the degree of curve D. This is the central angle formed by the radii to two
successive stations or, what is the same in this instance, the central angle subtended by a
chord of 100 ft (30.5 m). Then

sin 1X2Z) - — 

R

(23)

So 1X2D = arcsin 50/1200 = arcsin 0.04167; 1X2Z) = 2°23.3'; Z) = 4°46.6'.

4. Determine the station at the PT

Number of stations on the curve = 28°/4°46.6' = 5.862; station of PT = (82 + 30) +
( 5+ 86 .2 ) -88+ 16.2.

5. Calculate the deflection angle of station 83 and the difference
between the deflection angles of station 88 and the PT

For simplicity, assume that central angles are directly proportional to their corresponding
chord lengths; the resulting error is negligible. Then S83 = 0.70(2°23.3') = 1°40.3;; 6pT -
S88 = 0.162(2°23.3') = 0°23.2'.

6. Calculate the deflection angle of each station

Do this by adding 1X2D to that of the preceding station. Record the results thus:

7. Calculate the degree of curve in the present instance

Part c. Since the subtended central angle is directly proportional to its arc length, Z)/100 =
360/(2TrK); therefore,

D = 18,000/Trtf = 5729.58/tf degrees 

(24)

Then, D = 5729.58/1200 = 4.7747° = 4°46.5'.

8. Repeat the calculations in steps 4, 5, and 6

INTERSECTION OF CIRCULAR CURVE
AND STRAIGHT LINE

In Fig. 14, MN represents a straight railroad spur that intersects the curved highway route
AB. Distances on the route are measured along the arc. Applying the recorded data, deter-
mine the station of the intersection point P.

Calculation Procedure:

1. Apply trigonometric relationships to determine three elements
in triangle ONP

Draw line OP. The problem resolves itself into the calculation of the central angle AOP,
and this may be readily found by solving the oblique triangle OTVP. Applying trigonomet-
ric relationships gives AV= T= 800 tan 54° = 1101.1 ft (335.62 m); AM= 1101.1 - 220 =
881.1 ft (268.56 m); AN=AM tan 28° = 468.5 ft (142.80 m); ON= 800 - 468.5 = 331.5 ft
(101.04 m); OP = 800 ft (243.84 m); ONP = 90° + 28° = 118°.

2. Establish the station of P

Solve triangle ONP to find the central angle; then calculate arc AP and establish the sta-
tion of P. By the law of sines, sin OPN= sin ONP(ON)IOP; therefore, OPN= 21°27.7';

FIGURE 14. Intersection of curve and straight line.

AOP = 180 ° - (118° + 21 °27.7') = 40°32.3' arc AP = 2ir (800)(40°32.3')/360° = 566.0 ft
(172.52 m); station of P = (22 + 00) + (5 + 66) = 27 + 66.

REALIGNMENT OF CIRCULAR CURVE BY
DISPLACEMENT OF FORWARD TANGENT

In Fig. 15, the horizontal circular curve AB has a radius of 720 ft (219.5 m) and an inter-
section angle of 126°. The curve is to be realigned by rotating the forward tangent
through an angle of 22° to the new position VB while maintaining the PT at B. Compute
the radius, and locate the PC of the new curve.

Calculation Procedure:

1. Find the tangent distance
of the new curve

Solve triangle B V V to find the tangent
distance of the new curve and the loca-
tion of V. Thus, A' = 126° - 22 ° =
104°; VB = 720 tan 63° = 1413.1 ft
(430.71 m). By the law of sines, VB =
14131 sin 126°/sin 104° = 1178.2 ft
(359.12 m); VV= 1413.1 sin 22°/sin
104 ° = 545.6 ft (166.30m).

2. Compute the radius R'

By Eq. 19, R' = 1178.2 cot 52° = 920.5
ft (280.57 m).

3. Determine the station
ofA

Thus, AV= VB = 1413.1 ft (403.71 m);
A' V = VB = 1178.2 ft (359.12 m); A 'A
= A' V + V V-AV=310.7 ft (94.7Om);
station of new PC = (34 + 41) - (3 +
10.7) = 31+30 .3.

FIGURE 15. Displacement of forward tan- 
gent. 

4. Verify the foregoing results

Draw the long chords AB and A'B. Then apply the computed value of R' to solve triangle
BA'A and thereby fmdA'A. By Eq. 20, A'B = 2R' sin 1X2A' = 1450.7 ft (442.17 m); AA'B =
1M' = 52°; A'AB = 180° - 1M = 117°; ABA9 = 180° - (52° + 117°) = 11°. By the law of
sines, A'A = 1450.7 sin 1 l°/sin 117° = 310.7 ft (94.70 m). This is acceptable.

CHARACTERISTICS OFA
COMPOUND CURVE

The tangents to a horizontal curve intersect at an angle of 68°22'. To fit the curve to the
terrain, it is necessary to use a compound curve having tangent lengths of 955 ft (291.1 m)

FIGURE 16. Compound curve.

and 800 ft (243.8 m), as shown in Fig. 16. The minimum allowable radius is 1000 ft
(304.8 m). Compute the larger radius and the two central angles.

Calculation Procedure:

1. Calculate the latitudes and departures of the known sides

A compound curve is a curve that comprises two successive circular arcs of unequal radii
that are tangent at their point of intersection, the centers of the arcs lying on the same side
of their common tangent. (Where the centers lie on opposite sides of this tangent, the
curve is termed a reversed curve). In Fig. 16, C is the point of intersection of the arcs, and
DE is the common tangent.
This situation is analyzed without applying any set equation to illustrate the general
method of solution for compound and reversed curves. There are two unknown quantities:
the radius R1 and a central angle. (Since A1 + A2 = A, either central angle may be consid-
ered the unknown.)
If the polygon A VBO2O1 is visualized as a closed tr^/erse, the latitudes and departures
of its sides are calculated, and the sum of the latitudes and sum of the departures are
equated to zero, two simultaneous equations containing these two unknowns are obtained.
For convenience, select O1A as the reference meridian. Then

2. Express the latitudes and departures of the unknown sides In
terms of R1 and A1

Thus, for side O2O1: length = R1 - 1000; bearing = A1; latitude = -(R1 - 1000) cos A1; de-
parture = -(R1 - 1000) sin A1.
Also, for side O1A: length = ^1 bearing = O; latitude = R1 departure = O.

3. Equate the sum of the latitudes and sum of the departures to
zero; express A1 as a function of R1

Thus, Slat - R1 - (R1 - 1000) cos A1 - 1112.32 - O; cos A1 = (R1 - 1112.32V(IJ1 - 1000),
or 1 - cos A1 - 11 2 3 2 / ( R1 - 1000), Eq. a. Also, Sdep = -(R1 - 1000) sin A1 + 320.37 = O;
sin A1 - 320.37/(^1 - 1000), Eq. b.

4. Divide Eq. a by Eq. b, and determine the central angles

Thus, (1 -cos AO/sin A1 - tan 1M1 = 112.32/320.37; 1M1 = 19°19'13"; A1 = 38°38'26";
A2 = 68022 ' -A1=29 °43 '34".

5. Substitute the value of A1 in Eq. b to find R1

Thus, R1 = 1513.06 ft (461.181m).

6. Verify the foregoing results by analyzing triangle DEV

Thus, AD = R1 tan 1M1 = 530.46 ft (161.684 m); DV= 955 - 530.46 = 424.54 ft (129.400
m); EB = R2 tan 1X2A2 = 265.40 ft (80.894 m); VE = 800 - 265.40 - 534.60 ft (162.946 m);
DE = 530.46 + 265.40 = 795.86 ft (242.578 m). By the law of cosines, cos A = -(DF2 +
VE2-DE2)/[2(DV)(VE); A = 68°22'. This is correct.

ANALYSIS OFA HIGHWAY
TRANSITION SPIRAL

A horizontal circular curve for a highway is to be designed with transition spirals. The PI
is at station 34 + 93.81, and the intersection angle is 52°48'. In accordance with the gov-
erning design criteria, the spirals are to be 350 ft (106.7 m) long and the degree of curve
of the circular curve is to be 6° (arc definition). The approach spiral will be staked by set-
ting the transit at the TS and locating 10 stations on the spiral by means of their deflection
angles from the main tangent. Compute all data needed for staking the approach spiral.
Also, compute the long tangent, short tangent, and external distance.

Calculation Procedure:

1. Calculate the basic values

In the design of a road, a spiral is interposed between a straight-line segment and a circu-
lar curve to effect a gradual transition from rectilinear to circular motion, and vice versa.
The type of spiral most frequently used is the clothoid, which has the property that the

curvature at a given point is directly proportional to the distance from the start of the
curve to the given point, measured along the curve.
Refer to Fig. 17. The key points are identified by the following notational system: PI =
point of intersection of main tangents; TS = point of intersection of main tangent and ap-
proach spiral (tangent-to-spiral point); SC = point of intersection of approach spiral and
circular curve (spiral-to-curve point); CS = point of intersection of circular curve and de-
parture spiral (curve-to-spiral point); ST = point of intersection of departure spiral and
main tangent (spiral-to-tangent point); PC and PT = point at which tangents to the circular
curve prolonged are parallel to the main tangents (also referred to as the offsets). Dis-
tances are designated in the following manner: Ls = length of spiral from TS to SC; L =
length of spiral from TS to given point on spiral; R0 radius of circular curve; R = radius of
curvature at given point on spiral; Ts, = length of main tangent from TS to PI; E3 = exter-
nal distance, i.e., distance from PI to midpoint of circular curve.
In addition, there is a long tangent (LT), short tangent (ST), and long chord (LC), as
indicated with respect to the departure spiral.
Place the origin of coordinates at the TS and the :c axis on the main tangent. Then

FIGURE 17. Notational system for transition spirals.

xc and yc = coordinates of SC; k and p = abscissa and ordinate, respectively, of PC. The
coordinates of the SC and PC are useful as parameters in the calculation of required dis-
tances. The distance p is termed the throw, or shift, of the curve; it represents the dis-
placement of the circular curve from the main tangent resulting from interposition of the
spiral.
The basic angles are A = angle between main tangents, or intersection angle; Ac = an-
gle between radii at SC and CS, or central angle of circular curve; 6S = angle between
radii of spiral at TS and SC, or central angle of entire spiral; Dc = degree of curve of cir-
cular curve D = degree of curve at given point on spiral; 8S = deflection angle of SC from
main tangent, with transit at TS; 8 = deflection angle of given point on spiral from main
tangent, with transit at TS.
Although extensive tables of spiral values have been compiled, this example is solved
without recourse to these tables in order to illuminate the relatively simple mathematical
relationships that inhere in the clothoid. Consider that a vehicle starts at the TS and trav-
erses the approach spiral at constant speed. The degree of curve, which is zero at the TS,
increases at a uniform rate to become Dc at the SC. The basic equations are

a _ 

L5D0 

s c _ 

L5

s

Even though several of the foregoing equations are actually approximations, their use is
valid when the value of D0 is relatively small.
Calculating the basic values yields A = 52°48'; Ls = 350 ft (106.7 m); D0 = 6°; Os =
LA/200 - 350(6)7200 = 10.5 ° = 10°30', or 0, = 10.5(0.017453) = 0.18326 rad; Ac =
52°48' - 2(10°30') = 31°48'; D0 = 6(0.017453) = 0.10472 rad; R0 = 100/DC = 954.93 ft
(291.063 m); xc = 350(1 - 0.183262/10) = 348.83 ft (106.323 m); yc = 350(0.18326/3 -
0.183262/42) = 21.33 ft (6.501 m); k =348.83 -954.93 sin 10°30' = 174.80 ft (53.279m);
p = 21.33 - 954.93(1 - cos 10°30') = 5.34 ft (1.628 m).

2. Locate the TS and SC

Thus, T5 = (954.93 + 5.34) tan 26°24' + 174.80 = 651.47; station of TS = (34 + 93.81)
-(6 + 51.47) = 28 + 42.34; station of SC = (28 + 42.34) + (3 + 50.00) - 3 1+ 92.34.

3. Calculate the deflection angles

Thus, S5 = 10°30V3 = 3°30' - 3.5°. Apply Eq. 32 to find the deflection angles at the inter-
mediate stations. For example, for point 7, 8 = 0.72(3.5°) - 1.715° = 1°42.9'.
Record the results in Table 1. The chord lengths between successive stations differ
from the corresponding arc lengths by negligible amounts, and therefore each chord
length may be taken as 35.00 ft (1066.8 cm).

4. Compute the LJ1 57, and E3

Thus, LT = 348.83 - 21.33 cot 10°30' = 233.75 ft (7124.7 cm); ST = 21.33 esc 10°30' =
117.04 ft (3567.4 cm); E3 = (954.93 + 5.34)(sec 26°24' - 1) + 5.34 = 117.14 ft (3570.4
cm).

5. Verify the last three calculations by substituting

TRANSITION SPIRAL: TRANSIT
ATINTERMEDIATE STATION

Referring to the transition spiral in the previous calculation procedure, assume that lack of
visibility from the TS makes these setups necessary: Points 4, 5, 6, and 7 will be located
with the transit at point 3; points 8 and 9 and the SC will be located with the transit at
point 7. Compute the orientation and deflection angles.

Calculation Procedure:

1. Consider that the transit is set up at point 3 and a backsight
is taken to the TS; find the orientation angle

In Fig. 18, assume that the spiral has been staked up to P with the transit set up at the TS
and that the remainder of the spiral is to be staked with the transit set up at P. Deflection
angles are measured from the tangent through P (the local tangent). The instrument is ori-
ented by back-sighting to a preceding point B and then turning the angle 8b. The orienta-
tion angle to B and deflection angle to a subsequent point F are

Sb = (2Lp + Lb)(Lp-Lb)^ 

Sf= (2Lp +Lf)(Lf-Lp)^ 

(38)

(39)

If B, P, and F are points obtained by dividing the spiral into an integral number of
arcs, these equations may be converted to these more suitable forms:

8h = (2np + nb)(np-np) -J^ 

8r (2np + nf)(nf -np) -^ 

(38a)

(396)

where n denotes the number of arcs to the designated point.

lation procedure, we find Os = 10.5°, 05/(3«5
3 ;^ = 6(3)(2.1') = 0037.8/.

2. Find the deflection angles from the tangent through point 3

Thus, by Eq. 39a: point 4, 8 = (6 + 4)(2.1') = 0°21'; point 5, 6 - (6 + 5)(2)(2.1') -
0°46.2'; point 6, 5 = (6 + 6)(3)(2.1') = 1°15.6'; point 7, S = (6 + 7)(4)(2.1') = 1°49.2'.

3. Consider that the transit is set up at point 7 and a backsight is
taken to point 3; compute the orientation angle

Thus nb = 3; np = 7; 8b = (14 + 3)(4)(2.1') - 2°22.8'.

4. Compute the deflection angles from the tangent through
point 7

Thus point 8, 8 = (14 + 8)(2.1') - 0°46.2'; point 9, 8 = (14 + 9)(2)(2.1') - 1°36.6' Sc, 8 =
(14+10)(3)(2.1') = 2°31.2'.

5. Test the results obtained

In Fig. 18, extend chord PF to its intersection with the main tangent, and let a denote the
angle between these lines. Then

(40)

This result should equal the sum of the angles applied in staking the curve from the TS to
F. This procedure will be shown with respect to point 9.
For point 9, let P and F refer to points 7 and 9, respectively. Then a = (92 + 9 x
7 + 72)(2.1') - 6°45.3'. Summing the angles leading from the TS to point 9, we get

Deflection angle from main tangent to point 3 
Orientation angle at point 3 
Deflection angle from local tangent to point 7 
Orientation angle at point 7 
Deflection angle from local tangent to point 9 
Total 

0° 18.9'

This test may be applied to each deflection angle beyond point 3.

PLOTTING A PARABOLIC ARC

A grade of-4.6 percent is followed by a grade of+1 .8 percent, the grades intersecting at
station 54 + 20 of elevation 296.30 ft (90.312 m). The change in grade is restricted to 2
percent in 100 ft (30.5 m). Compute the elevation of every 50-ft (15.24-m) station on the
parabolic curve, and locate the sag (lowest point of the curve). Apply both the average-
grade method and the tangent-offset method.

Calculation Procedure:

1. Compute the required length of curve

Using the notation in Figs. 19 and 20, we have Ga = -4.6 percent; Gb = +1.8 percent;

r = rate of change in grade = 0.02 percent per

2. Locate the PC and PT

The station of the PC = station of the PI -
'L/2 = (54 + 20) - (1 + 60) = 52 + 60; station
of PT = (54 + 20) + (1 + 60) = 55 + 80; ele-
vation of PC = elevation of PI - GJ./2 =

2% 3Q + Q 046(16Q) = 3Q3 66 ft (92 £6 m);

elevation of PT - 296.30 + 0.018(160) =
299.18 ft (91.19Om).

3. Use the average-grade method to find the elevation of
each station

Calculate the grade at the given station; calculate the average grade between the PI and
that station, and multiply the average grade by the horizontal distance to find the ordinate.

5. Apply the tangent-offset method to find the elevation
of each station

Since this method is based on Eq. 41, substitute directly in that equation. For the present
case, the equation becomes y = rx2/2 + G^x = 0.000 Ix2 — 0.046*. Record the calculations
for y in tabular form. The results, as shown, agree with those obtained by the average-
grade method.

6. Locate the sag S

Since the grade is zero at this point, Eq. 42 yields G5 = rxs + Ga = O; therefore xs = -GJr =
-(-0.046/0.0002) = 230 ft (70.1 m); station of sag = (52 + 60) + (2 + 30) = 54 + 90; Gav =
V2G0 = -0.023; ys = -0.023(230) = •- 5.29 ft (1.61 m); elevation of sag = 303.66 - 5.29 =
298.37 ft (90.943 m).

7. Verify the location of the sag

Do this by ascertaining that the offsets of the PC and PT from the tangent through S9
which is horizontal, satisfy the tangent-offset principle. From the preceding results, tan-
gent offset of PC = 5.29 ft (1.612 m); tangent offset of PT = 5.29 - 4.48 = 0.81 ft (0.247
m); distance to PC = 230 ft (70.1 m); distance to PT = 320 - 230 = 90 ft (27.4 m);
5.29/0.81 = 6.53; 2302/902 = 6.53. Therefore, the results are verified.

LOCATION OFA SINGLE STATION ON A
PARABOLICARC

The PC of a vertical parabolic curve is at station 22 + OO of elevation 165.30, and the
grade at the PC is + 3.2 percent. The elevation of the station 24 + OO is 168.90 ft (51.481
m). What is the elevation of station 25 + 50?

Calculation Procedure:

1. Compute the offset of P1 from the tangent through the PC

Refer to Fig. 21. The tangent-offset principle offers the simplest method of solution. Thus
Jc1 = 200 ft (61.0 m); yi = 168.90 - 165.30 = 3.60 ft (1.097 m); Q1T1 = 200(0.032) = 6.40
ft (1.951 m); P1T1 = 6.40 - 3.60 = 2.80 ft (0.853 m).

2. Compute the offset of P2 from the tangent through the PC;
find the elevation of P2

Thus Jc2 = 350 ft (106.7 m); P2T2I(PiT1) = Jcf/jc2; P2T2 = 2.80(350/20O)2 = 8.575 ft (2.6137
m); Q2T2 = 350(0.032) = 11.2 ft (3.41 m); ^2P2 = 11.2 - 8.575 = 2.625 ft (0.8001 m); ele-
vation OfP2 = 165.30 + 2.625 = 167.925 ft (51.184 m).

FIGURE 21

LOCATION OFA SUMMIT

An approach grade of+1 .5 percent intersects a grade of-2.5 percent at station 29 + OO of
elevation 226.30 ft (68.976 m). The connecting parabolic curve is to be 800 ft (243.8 m)
long. Locate the summit.

Calculation Procedure:

1. Locate the PC

Draw a freehand sketch of the curve, and record all values in the sketch as they are ob-
tained. Thus, station of PC = station of PI - L/2 = 25 + 00; elevation of PC = 226.30 -
400(0.015) = 220.30 ft (67.147 m).

2. Calculate the rate of change in grade; locate the summit

Apply the average-grade method to locate the summit. Thus, r = (-2.5 - 1.5)7800 =
-0.005 percent per foot.
Place the origin of coordinates at the PC. By Eq. 42, xs = -GJr = 1.5/0.005 = 300 ft
(91.44 m). From the PC to the summit, Gav = 1AG0 = 0.75 percent. Then ys = 300(0.0075)
= 2.25 ft (0.686 m); station of summit = (25 + 00) + (3 + 00) = 28 + 00; elevation of sum-
mit = 220.30 + 2.25 = 222.55 ft (67.833 m). The summit can also be located by the tan-
gent-offset method.

PARABOLIC CURVE TO CONTAIN
A GIVEN POINT

A grade of-1.6 percent is followed by a grade of+3 .8 percent, the grades intersecting at
station 42 + OO of elevation 210.00 ft (64.008 m). The parabolic curve connecting these

grades is to pass through station 42 + 60 of elevation 213.70 ft (65.136 m). Compute the
required length of curve.

Calculation Procedure:

1. Compute the tangent offsets; establish the horizontal location
of P in terms of L

Refer to Fig. 22, where P denotes the specified point. The given data enable computation
of the tangent offsets CP and DP, thus giving a relationship between the horizontal dis-
tances from A to P and from P to B. Since the distance from the centerline of curve to P is
known, the length of curve may readily be found.
Computing the tangent offsets gives CP = V- Gah and DP = V- Gb

from tangent through A = 4.66 ft (1.4203 m); 4.66/11.232 = 0.415; (208 + 60)2/(416)2 =
0.415. This is acceptable.

SfGHT DISTANCE ON A VERTICAL CURVE

A vertical summit curve has tangent grades of+2 .6 and -1.5 percent. Determine the min-
imum length of curve that is needed to provide a sight distance of 450 ft (137.2 m) to an
object 4 in (101.6 mm) in height. Assume that the eye of the motorist is 4.5 ft (1.37 m)
above the roadway.

Calculation Procedure:

1. State the equation for minimum length when S < L

The vertical curvature of a road must be limited to ensure adequate visibility across the
summit. Consequently, the distance across which a given change in grade may be effected
is subject to a lower limit imposed by the criterion of sight distance.
Let S denote the required sight distance and L the minimum length of curve. In Fig.
23, let E denote the position of the motorist's eye and P the top of an object. Assume that
the curve has the maximum allowable curvature, so that the distance from E to P equals S.
Applying Eq. 44a gives

where A = Ga - Gb, in percent.

2. Find the grade of the drift

Apply Eq. 48. In Fig. 24Z), OA is a horizontal line in the vein, OB is the horizontal projec-
tion of the drift, and the arrow indicates the direction of dip. Then angle COD = 430IO' —
38°20' = 4 °50'; B = angle CDO = 90° - 4°50' = 850IO '; tan /3 = tan 33°14' cos 850IO' =
0.0552; grade of drift = 5.52 percent.

3. Alternatively, solve without the use of Eq. 48

In Fig. 246, set OD = 100 ft (30.5 m); let D' denote the point on the face of the vein verti-
cally below D. Then CD = 100 sin 4°50' = 8.426 ft (2.5682 m); drop in elevation from O
to D' = drop in elevation from C to D' = 8.426 tan 33°14' = 5.52 ft (1.682 m). Therefore,
grade = 5.52 percent.

DETERMINING STRIKE AND DIP FROM
TWO APPARENT DIPS

Three points on the hanging wall (upper face) of a vein of ore have been located by verti-
cal boreholes. These points, designated P9 Q9 and R9 have these relative positions: P is
142 ft (43.3 m) above Q and 130 ft (39.6 m) above R; horizontal projection of PQ, length
= 180 ft (54.9 m) and bearing = S55°32'W; horizontal projection of PR9 length = 220 ft
(67.1 m) and bearing = N19 °26'W. Determine the strike and dip of the vein by both
graphical construction and trigonometric calculations.

Calculation Procedure:

1. Plot the given data for the graphical procedure

In Fig. 25a, draw lines PQ and PR in plan in accordance with the given data for their hor-
izontal projections. The angle of inclination of any line other than a dip line is an apparent
dip of the vein.

2. Draw the elevations

In Fig. 256 and c, draw elevations normal to PQ and PR, respectively, locating the points
in accordance with the given differences in elevation. Find the points S and Trying on PQ
and PR, respectively, at an arbitrary distance v below P.

3. Draw the representation of the strike of the vein

Locate points S and T in Fig. 25«, and connect them with a straight line. This line is hori-
zontal, and its bearing </>, therefore, represents the strike of the vein.

4. Draw an edge view of the vein

In Fig. 25 J, draw an elevation parallel to ST. Since this is an edge view of one line in the
face, it is an edge view of the vein itself; it therefore represents the dip a of the vein in its
true magnitude.

5. Determine the strike and dip

Scale angles k and a, respectively. In Fig. 25a, the direction of dip is represented by the
arrow perpendicular to ST.

6. Draw the dip line for the trigonometric solution

In Fig. 26, draw an isometric view of triangle PST, and draw the dip line PW. Its angle of
inclination a equals the dip of the vein. Let O denote the point on a vertical line through P
at the same elevation as S and T. Let /S1 and /32 denote the angle of inclination of PS and

7. Express B1 in terms of the known angles )SY P2 and B

Then substitute numerical values to find the strike <f) of the vein. Thus

tan'1 = ^mT-

For this vein, m = tan ft/tan JS1 = 130(180)/[220(142)] = 0.749040; 6 = 180° - (55°32' +
19°26') = 105°02'. Substituting gives tan B1 = (0.749040 + 0.259381)70.965775; B1 =

8. Compute the dip of the vein

Use Eq. 48, considering PS as the line of known inclination. Thus, tan a = tan /B1IcOS

Applying the specified bearings, draw the horizontal projections AC and BD of the bore-
holes in Fig. 21 a.

2. Locate the points of intersection with the hanging wall and
footwall in elevation

In Fig. 276, draw an elevation normal to the borehole through A; locate the points of in-
tersection H0 and F0 with the hanging wall and footwall, respectively. Select the horizon-
tal plane through A as datum.

3. Repeat the foregoing construction with respect to borehole
through B

This construction is shown in Fig. 21 c.

4. Locate the points of intersection in plan

In Fig. 21 a, locate the points of intersection. Draw lines H0H17 and F0F^ The former lies
in the hanging wall and the latter in the footwall. To avoid crowding, reproduce the plan
of line H0H,, in Fig. 27d.

5. Draw the plan of a line HbG that is parallel and equal in length
to FaFb

Do this by applying the second principle given above. In accordance with principle a,

HbG lies in the hanging wall, and this plane is therefore determined. The ensuing con-
struction parallels that in the previous calculation procedure.

6. Establish a system of rectangular coordinate axes

Use A as the origin (Fig. 270). Make x the east-west axis, y the north-south axis, and jc the
vertical axis.

7. Apply the given data to obtain the coordinates
of the intersection points and point G

For example, with respect to F09 y = 205 cos 49° cos 58°30'. The coordinates of G are ob-
tained by adding to the coordinates of Hb the differences between the coordinates of Fa
and Fb. The results are shown:

8. For convenience, reproduce the plan of the intersection
points, and G

This is shown in Fig. 28a.

9. Locate the point S at the same elevation as G

In Fig. 28Z>, draw an elevation normal to H0H^ and locate the point S on this line at the
same elevation as G.

10. Establish the strike of the plane

Locate S in Fig. 28«, and draw the horizontal line SG. Since both S and G lie on the hang-
ing wall, the strike of this plane is now established.

11. Complete the graphical solution

In Fig. 28c, draw an elevation parallel to SG. The line through H0 and Hb and that through
Fa and Fb should be parallel to each other. This drawing is an edge view of the vein, and it
presents the dip a and thickness t in their true magnitude. The graphical solution is now
completed.

12. Reproduce the plan view

For convenience, reproduce the plan of H09 Hb, and G in Fig. 28J. Draw the horizontal
projection of the dip line, and label the angles as indicated.

13. Compute the lengths of lines HaHb and HaG

Compute these lengths as projected on each coordinate axis and as projected on a hori-
zontal plane. Use absolute values. Thus, line H0H5: Lx = 30.8 - 20.2 = 10.6 ft (3.23 m); Ly
= 18.9 - (-130.3) = 149.2 ft (45.48 m); L2 = -41.5 - (-121.7) = 80.2 ft (24.44 m); Z,hor =
(10.62 + 149.22)0-5 = 149.6 ft (45.60 m). Line H0G: Lx = 97A - 30.8 = 66.6 ft (20.30 m); Ly
= 87.7 - 18.9 = 68.8 ft (20.97 m); L2 = -41.5 - (-74.4) = 32.9 ft (10.03 m); Lhor = (66.62 +
68.82)0-5 = 95.8 ft (29.20 m).

14. Compute the bearing and inclination of lines HaHb and HaG

Let (^1 = bearing OfH0Hj,; $2 = bearing ofHaG; 
/B1 = angle of inclination OfH0H1,; 
j82
angle of inclination of H0G. Then tan ^1 = 10.6/149.2; ^1 = S4°04'W; tan c/>2 = 66.6/68.8;
^2 = N44 °04'E; tan Q1 = 80.2/149.6; tan ft = 32.9/95.8.

15. Compute angle O shown in Fig. 2Bd; determine the strike
of the vein, using Eq. 49

Thus, 6 = 180° + <£i - <fe = 14O0OO'; m = tan ft/tan /S1 = 0.6406; tan O1 = (m - cos
140°00')/sin 14O0OO'; 0t = 65°26'; O2 = 74°34' The bearing of the horizontal projection
of the dip line = ^1 - ^1 = S61°22'E; therefore, the strike of the vein = N28°38'E.

16. Compute the dip a of the vein

By Eq. 48, tan a = tan /B1IcOs O1; a = 52°12'; or tan a = tan /32/cos O2; a = 52°14'. This
slight discrepancy between the two computed values falls within the tolerance of these
calculations. Use the average value a = 52° 13'.

17. Establish the reiationship between the true thickness t
of a vein and its apparent thickness f' as measured along a
skew borehole

Refer to Figs. 27 and 28. Let 8 = angle of inclination of borehole; y = angle in plan be-
tween downward-sloping segments of borehole and dip line of vein. Then

t = t'(cos a sin 8 -sin a cos 8 cos y) 

(50)

18. Find the true thickness, using Eq. 50

Thus, borehole through A: 8 = 49°; y = 180° - (58°30' + 61°22') = 60°08'; t' + 205 - 55
= 150 ft (45.7 m); t = 150(cos 52°13' sin 49° - sin 52°13' cos 49° cos 60°08') = 30.6 ft
(9.3 m). For the borehole through B: 8 = 73°; y = 61°22' - 44°50' = 16°32'; /' = 182 - 98
= 84 ft (25.6 m); t = 84(cos 52°13' sin 73° - sin 52°13' cos 73° cos 16°32') = 30.6 ft
(9.3 m). This agrees with the value previously computed.

Aerial Photogrammetry

FLYING HEIGHTREQUIRED TO YIELD
A GIVEN SCALE

At what altitude above sea level must an aircraft fly to obtain vertical photography having
an average scale of 1 cm = 120 m if the camera lens has a focal length of 152 mm and the
average elevation of the terrain to be surveyed is 290 m?

Calculation Procedure:

1. Write the equation for the scale of a vertical photograph

In aerial photogrammetry, the term photograph generally refers to the positive photo-
graph, and the plane of this photograph is considered to lie on the object side of the lens.
A photograph is said to be vertical if the optical axis of the lens is in a vertical position at
the instant of exposure. Since the plane of the photograph is normal to the optical axis,
this plane is horizontal.
In Fig. 29a, point L is the front nodal point of the lens; a ray of light directed at this
point leaves the lens without undergoing a change in direction. The point o at which the
optical axis intersects the plane of the photograph is called the principal point. The dis-
tance from the ground to the camera may be considered infinite in relation to the dimen-
sions of the lens, and so the distance Lo is equal to the focal length of the lens. The air-
craft is assumed to be moving in a horizontal straight line, termed the line of flight, and
the elevation of L above the horizontal datum plane is called the flying height. The posi-
tion of L in space at the instant of exposure is called the exposure station. Where the area
to be surveyed is relatively small, the curvature of the earth may be disregarded.
Since the plane of the photograph is horizontal, Fig. 296 is a view normal to this plane
and so presents all distances in this plane in their true magnitude. In the photograph, the
origin of coordinates is placed at o. The jc axis is placed parallel to the line of flight, with
jc values increasing in the direction of flight, and the y axis is placed normal to the x axis.
In Fig. 29, A is a point on the ground, a is the image of A on the photograph, and O is
a point at the same elevation as A that lies on the prolongation of Lo. Thus, o is the image
of a
The scale of a photograph, expressed as a fraction, is the ratio of a distance in the

18. Find the true thickness, using Eq. 50

Thus, borehole through A: 8 = 49°; y = 180° - (58°30' + 61°22') = 60°08'; t' + 205 - 55
= 150 ft (45.7 m); t = 150(cos 52°13' sin 49° - sin 52°13' cos 49° cos 60°08') = 30.6 ft
(9.3 m). For the borehole through B: 8 = 73°; y = 61°22' - 44°50' = 16°32'; /' = 182 - 98
= 84 ft (25.6 m); t = 84(cos 52°13' sin 73° - sin 52°13' cos 73° cos 16°32') = 30.6 ft
(9.3 m). This agrees with the value previously computed.

photograph to the corresponding distance along the ground. In this case, the ratio is 1
cm/120 m = 0.01 m/120 m = 1/12,000.
Let H = flying height; h = elevation of A above datum;/= focal length; S = scale of
photograph, expressed as a fraction. From Fig. 29, S = oalOA, and by similar triangles S =
fl(H-h).

2. Solve this equation for the flying height

Take sea level as datum. From the foregoing equation, with the meter as the unit of
length, H= h +/S = 290 + 0.1527(1/12,000) = 290 + 0.152(12,000) = 2114 m. This is the
required elevation of L above sea level.

DETERMINING GROUND DISTANCE
BY VERTICAL PHOTOGRAPH

Two points A and B are located on the ground at elevations of 250 and 190 m, respective-
ly, above sea level. The images of A and B on a vertical aerial photograph are a and 6, re-
spectively. After correction for film shrinkage and lens distortion, the coordinates of a
and b in the photograph are xa - -73.91 mm, ya = +44.78 mm, xb = +84.30 mm, andyb =
-21.65 mm, where the subscript identifies the point. The focal length is 209.6 mm, and
the flying height is 2540 m above sea level. Determine the distance between A and B as
measured along the ground.

Calculation Procedure:

1. Determine the relationship between coordinates
in the photograph and those in the datum plane

Refer to Fig. 29, and let X and 7 denote coordinate axes that are vertically below the x and
y axes, respectively, and in the datum plane. Omitting the subscript, we have x/X=y/Y=
oalOA = S =fl(H- h), giving X = x(H- /*)//and Y = y(H- h)/f.

2. Compute the coordinates of A and B in the datum plane

For A, H-h = 2540 - 250 = 2290 m. Substituting gives XA = (-0.07391)(2290)/0.2096 =
-807.5 m and YA = (+0.04478)(2290)/0.2096 = + 489.2 m. For £ , / / - /* = 2540 - 190 =
2350 m. Then XB = (+0.08430)(2350)/0.2096 = +945.2 m, and YB = (-0.02165)
(2350)70.2096 =-242.7m.

3. Compute the required distance

Let &X = XA — XB, A7 = YA — YB, and AB = distance between A and B as measured along
the ground. Disregarding the difference in elevation of the two points, we have (AB)2 =
(kX)2 + (AT)2. Then AZ=-1752.7 m, A7= 731.9 m, and(AB )2 = (1752.7)2 + (731.9)2, or
AB= 1899m.

DETERMINING THE HEIGHT OF A
STRUCTURE BY VERTICAL PHOTOGRAPH

In Fig. 30, points A and B are located at the top and bottom, respectively, and on the verti-
cal centerline of a tower. These points have images a and b, respectively, on a vertical aer-
ial photograph having a scale of 1:10,800 with reference to the ground, which is approxi-
mately level. In the photograph, oa = 76.61 mm and ob = 71.68 mm. The focal length is
210.1 mm. Find the height of the tower.

Calculation Procedure:

1. Compute the flying height with reference to the ground

Take the ground as datum. Then scale S = ftH, or H = flS = 0.2101/(1/10,80O) =
0.2101(10,800) = 2269m.

2. Establish the relationship between height of tower and
distances in the photograph

Let g = height of tower. In Fig. 30, oa/D =//(# - g) and ob/D = JJH. Thus, oa/ob =
(H- g). Solving gives g = H(I - ob/oa).

3. Compute the height of tower

Substituting in the foregoing equation yields g = 2269(1 - 71.68/76.61) = 146 m.

Related Calculations: Let A denote a point at an elevation h above the datum,
let B denote a point that lies vertically below A and in the datum plane, and let a and b de-
note the images of A and B, respectively. As Fig. 30 shows, a and b lie on a straight line
that passes through o, which is called a radial line. The distance d = ba is the displace-
ment of the image of A resulting from its elevation above the datum, and it is termed the
relief displacement of A. Thus, the relief displacement of a point is radially outward if that
point lies above datum and radially inward if it lies below datum. From above, ob/oa =
(H- K)IH, where H= flying height above datum. Then d = oa - ob = (oa)h/H.

DETERMINING GROUND DISTANCE
BY TILTED PHOTOGRAPH

Two points A and B are located on the ground at elevations of 180 and 13Om, respective-
ly, above sea level. Points A and B have images a and b, respectively, on an aerial photo-
graph, and the coordinates of the images are xa = +40.63 mm, ya = -73.72 mm, xb =
-78.74 mm, andyfe = +20.32 mm. The focal length is 153.6 mm, and the flying height is
2360 m above sea level. By use of ground control points, it was established that the pho-
tograph has a tilt of 2°54' and a swing of 162°. Determine the distance between A and B.

Calculation Procedure:

1. Compute the transformed coordinates of the images

Refer to Fig. 31, where L again denotes the front nodal point of the lens and o denotes the
principal point. A photograph is said to be tilted, or near vertical, if by inadvertence the
optical axis of the lens is displaced slightly from the vertical at the time of exposure. The
tilt t is the angle between the optical axis and the vertical. The principal plane is the verti-
cal plane through the optical axis. Since the plane of the photograph is normal to the opti-
cal axis, it is normal to the principal plane. Therefore, Fig. 3 Ia is an edge view of the
plane of the photograph. Moreover, the angle between the plane of the photograph and the
horizontal equals the tilt. In Fig. 31, A is a point on the ground and a is its image. Line AQ
is normal to the principal plane, Q lies in that plane, and q is the image of Q.
Consider the vertical line through L. The points n and Af at which this line intersects
the plane of the photograph and the ground are called the nadir point and ground nadir
point, respectively. The line of intersection of the principal plane and the plane of the
photograph, which is line no prolonged, is termed the principal line. Now consider the
vertical plane through o parallel to the line of flight. In the photograph, the x axis is placed
on the line at which this vertical plane intersects the plane of the photograph, with jc val-
ues increasing in the direction of flight. The y axis is normal to the x axis, and the origin
lies at o. The swing s is the angle in the plane of the photograph, measured in a clockwise
direction, between the positive side of the y axis and the radial line extending from o to n.
Transform the x and y axes in this manner: First, rotate the axes in a counterclockwise
direction until the y axis lies on the principal line with its positive side on the upward side
of the photograph; then displace the origin from o to n. Let jc' andy denote, respectively,
the axes to which the x andy axes have been transformed. The x' axis is horizontal. Let 6
denote the angle through which the axes are rotated in the first step of the transformation.
From Fig. 3Ib9O= 180°-s.
The transformed coordinates of a point in the plane of the photograph are x' = x cos 6
+y sin 6; y' = -x sin 6+y cos O +/tan t. In this case, t = 2°54' and O = 180° - 162° = 18°.

2. Write the equations of the datum-plane coordinates

Let X and Y denote coordinate axes that lie in the datum plane and in the same vertical
planes as the x' and y' axes, respectively, as shown in Fig. 31. Draw the horizontal line kq

in the principal plane. Then kq = cos t and Lk =/sec

Calculation Procedure:

1. Establish the relationship between elevation and parallax

Two successive photographs are said to overlap if a certain amount of terrain appears in
both. The ratio of the area that is common to the two photographs to the total area appear-
ing in one photograph is called the overlap. (In practice, this value is usually about 60
percent.) The distance between two successive exposure stations is termed the air base. If
a point on the ground appears in both photographs, its image undergoes a displacement
from the first photograph to the second, and this displacement is known as the parallax of
the point. This quantity is evaluated by using the micrometer of a parallax bar and then
increasing or decreasing the micrometer reading by some constant.
Assume that there is no change in the direction of flight. As stated, the x axis in the
photograph is parallel to the line of flight, with x values increasing in the direction of
flight. Refer to Fig. 32, where photographs 1 and 2 are two successive photographs and
the subscripts correspond to the photograph numbers. Let A denote a point in the overlap-
ping terrain, and let a denote its image, with the proper subscript. Figure 32c discloses
thatjla =y2ai thus, parallax occurs solely in the direction of flight. Let/? = parallax and B
= air base. Then/? = xla — x2a = O1W1 — O2Jn2 = O1W1 + m2o2. Thus, W1W2 = B —p. By pro-
portion, (B -p)IE = (H-h ~f)/(H-

+0.61985.

2. Express the distance between the control points in terms of the
air base; solve the resulting equation

Disregarding the difference in elevation of the two points, we have (RS)2 = (XR-XS)2 +
(YR- Y8)2. N o w ,XR- XS = +0.61935 and YR- Y8 = -1.21005. Then 20732 = [(0.6193)2 +

DETERMINING SCALE OF
OBLIQUE PHOTOGRAPH

In a high-oblique aerial photograph, the distance between the apparent horizon and the
principal point as measured along the principal line is 86.85 mm. The flying height is
2925 m above sea level, and the focal length is 152.7 mm. What is the scale of this photo-
graph along a line that is normal to the principal line and at a distance of 20 mm above the
principal point as measured along the principal line?

Calculation Procedure:

1. Locate the true horizon in the photograph

Refer to Fig. 33. An oblique aerial photograph is one that is taken with the optical axis in-
tentionally displaced from the vertical, and a high-oblique photograph is one in which this
displacement is sufficiently large to bring the earth's surface into view. By definition, the
principal plane is the vertical plane that contains the optical axis, and the principal line is
the line of intersection of this vertical plane and the plane of the photograph.
Assume that the terrain is truly level. The apparent horizon is the slightly curved
boundary line in the photograph between earth and sky. Consider a conical surface that
has its vertex at the front nodal point L and that is tangent to the spherical surface of the
earth. If atmospheric refraction were absent, the apparent horizon would be the arc along
which this conical surface intersected the plane of the photograph. The true horizon is the
straight line along which the horizontal plane through L intersects the plane of the photo-
graph; it is normal to the principal line. In Fig. 33, M1 and M2 are lines in the principal
plane that pass through

0, which is angle oLK\. Then 6 = d + a. Let H = flying height above sea level in meters,
and d' = angle of dip in minutes. Then d' = 1.775 Vn9 Eq. a. This relationship is based
on the mean radius of the earth, and it includes allowance for atmospheric refraction.
From Fig. 34a, tan a = oK2/f, Eq. b. Then d1 = 1.775 V2925 = 96.0', or d = 1°36'. Also,
tan a = 86.85/152.7 = 0.5688, giving a = 29°38'. Thus, O = 1°36' + 29°38' = 31°14'.
From Fig. 34a, OK1 =/tan O, or oK} = 152.7(0.6064) = 92.60 mm. This dimension serves
to establish the true horizon.

2. Write the equation for the scale of a constant-scale line

Since the optical axis is inclined, the scale S of the photograph is constant only along a
line that is normal to the principal line, and so such a line is called a constant-scale line.
As we shall find, every constant-scale line has a unique value of S.
Refer to Fig. 35, where A is a point on the ground and a is its image. Line AQ is nor-
mal to the principal plane, Q lies in that plane, and q is the image of Q. Line Rq is a hori-
zontal line in the principal plane. If the terrain is truly level and curvature of the earth may
be disregarded, the vertical projection of the distance from A to L is H. Let e = distance in
photograph from true horizon to line qa. Along this line, S = qa/QA = LqILQ = LRILN.
But LR = e cos 6 and LN=H. Thus, S = (e cos S)IH, Eq. c.

From above, 6 = 31°14' and OK1 = 92.60 mm. Then e = 92.60 - 20 = 72.60 mm. By Eq. c,
S = (0.07260)(0.8551)72925 = 1/47,120.

Design of Highway Bridges

Where a bridge is supported by steel trusses, the stresses in the truss members are deter-
mined by applying the rules formulated in the truss calculation procedures given earlier in
this handbook.
The following procedures show the design of a highway bridge supported by concrete

or steel girders. Except for the deviations indicated, the Standard Specifications for High-
way Bridges, published by the American Association of State Highway and Transporta-
tion Officials (AASHTO), are applied.
The AASHTO Specification recognizes two forms of truck loading: the //loading, and
the HS loading. Both are illustrated in the Specification. For a bridge of relatively long
span, it is necessary to consider the possibility that several trucks will be present simulta-
neously. To approximate this condition, the AASHTO Specification offers various lane
loadings, and it requires that the bridge be designed for the lane loading if this yields
greater bending moments and shears than does the corresponding truck loading.
In designing the bridge members, it is necessary to modify the wheel loads to allow
for the effects of dynamic loading and the lateral distribution of loads resulting from the
rigidity of the floor slab.
The basic notational system is: DF = factor for lateral distribution of wheel loads; IF =
impact factor; P = resultant of group of concentrated loads.
The term live load as used in the following material refers to the wheel load after cor-
rection for distribution but before correction for impact.

DESIGN OFA T-BEAM BRIDGE

A highway bridge consisting of a concrete slab and concrete girders is to be designed
for these conditions: loading, HS20-44; clear width, 28 ft (8.5 m); effective span, 54 ft
(16.5 m); concrete strength, 3000 lb/in2 (20,685 kPa); reinforcement, intermediate
grade. The slab and girders will be poured monolithically, and the slab will include a %
in (19.05 mm) wearing surface. In addition, the design is to make an allowance of 15
lb/ft2 (718 N/m2) for future paving. Design the slab and the cross section of the interior
girders.

Calculation Procedure:

1. Record the allowable stresses and modular ratio given
in the AASHTO Specification

Refer to Fig. 36, which shows the spacing of the girders and the dimensions of the mem-
bers. The sizes were obtained by a trial-and-error method. Values from the Specification
are: w = 10 in stress calculations;/,. = 0.4/c' = 1200 lb/in2 (8274 kPa); for beams with web
reinforcement, vmax = 0.075/c' = 225 lb/in2 (1551.4 kPa);/, = 20,000 lb/in2 (137.9 MPa); u
= 0.10/c' = 300 lb/in2 (2068.5 kPa).

2. Compute the design coefficients associated with
balanced design

Thus, k = 1200/(12OO + 2000) = 0.375, using Eq. 21, Section 2. Using Eq. 22, Section 2,
J=I- 0.125 = 0.875. By Eq. 32, Section 29 K = 1/2(1200)(0.375)(0.875) = 197 lb/in2
(1358.3 kPa).

3. Establish the wheel loads and critical spacing associated with
the designated vehicular loading

As shown in the AASHTO Specification, the wheel-load system comprises two loads of
16 kips (71.2 kN) each and one load of 4 kips (17.8 kN). Since the girders are simply sup-
ported, an axle spacing of 14 ft (4.3 m) will induce the maximum shear and bending mo-
ment in these members.

FIGURE 36. Transverse section of T-beam bridge.

4. Verify that the slab size is adequate and design
the reinforcement

The AASHTO Specification does not present moment coefficients for the design of con-
tinuous members. The positive and negative reinforcement will be made identical, using
straight bars for both. Apply a coefficient of YIO in computing the dead-load moment. The
Specification provides that the span length S of a slab continuous over more than two sup-
ports be taken as the clear distance between supports.
In computing the effective depth, disregard the wearing surface, assume the use of No.
6 bars, and allow 1 in (25.4 mm) for insulation, as required by AASHTO. Then, d = 6.5 -
0.75 - 1.0 - 0.38 = 4.37 in (110.998 mm); WDL = (6.5/12)(150) + 15 = 96 Ib/lin ft (1401
N/m); MDL = (1Ao)W01S2 = (1/io)(96)(4.17)2 = 167 f t- lb (226 N-m); M1x= 0.8(5 + 2)P20/32,
by AASHTO, or MLL = 0.8(6.17)( 16,000)732 = 2467 f t- lb (3345 N-m). Also by AASHTO,
IF = 0.30; Mtotal = 12(167 + 1 . 3 Ox 2467) = 40,500 in-lb (4.6 kN-m). The moment corre-
sponding to balanced design is Mb = K^d2 = 197(12)(4.37)2 = 45,100 in-lb (5.1 kN-m).
The concrete section is therefore excessive, but a 6-in (152.4-mm) slab would be inade-
quate. The steel is stressed to capacity at design load. Or, As = 40,500/(20,0OO x 0.875 x
4.37) = 0.53 in2 (3.4 cm2). Use No. 6 bars 10 in (254 mm) on centers, top and bottom.
The transverse reinforcement resists the tension caused by thermal effects and by load
distribution. By AASHTO, At = 0.67(0.53) = 0.36 in2 (2.3 cm2). Use five No. 5 bars in
each panel, for which,4,= 1.55/4.17 = 0.37 in2 (2.4 cm2).

5. Calculate the maximum live-load bending moment
in the interior girder caused by the moving-load group

The method of positioning the loads to evaluate this moment is described in an earlier cal-
culation procedure in this handbook. The resultant, Fig. 37, has this location: d = [16(14)
+ 4(28)]/(16 + 16 + 4) = 9.33 ft (2.85 m). Place the loads in the position shown in Fig.
38a. The maximum live-load bending moment occurs under the center load.
The AASHTO prescribes a distribution factor of S/6 in the present instance, where S
denotes the spacing of girders. However, a factor of S/5 will be applied here. Then DF =
5.33/5 = 1.066; 16 x 1.066 = 17.06 kips (75.9 kN); 4 x 1.066 = 4.26 kips (18.9 kN); P =
2(17.06) + 4.26 = 38.38 kips (170.7 kN); RL = 38.38(29.33)/54 = 20.85 kips (92.7 kN).
The maximum live-load moment is M1x = 20.85(29.34) - 17.06(14) = 372.8 ft-kips (505
kN-m).

FIGURE 37. Load group and its resultant.

6. Calculate the maximum live-load shear in the interior girder
caused by the moving-load group

Place the loads in the position shown in Fig. 386. Do not apply lateral distribution to the
load at the support. Then, FLL = 16 + 17.06(40/54) + 4.26(26/54) = 30.69 kips (136.5 kN).

7. Verify that the size of the girder is adequate and design
the reinforcement

Thus, WDL = 5.33(96) + 14(33.5/144)(l50) = 1000 Ib/lin ft (14.6 kN/m); FDL = 27 kips
(120.1 kN); MDL = (1X8)(I)(S^ = 364.5 ft-kips (494 kN-m). By AASHTO, IF = 50/(54 +
125) = 0.28; Ftotal = 27 + 1.28(30.69) = 66.28 kips (294.8 kN); Mtotal = 12(364.5 + 1.28 *
372.8) = 10,100 in-kips (1141 N-m).
In establishing the effective depth of the girder, assume that No. 4 stirrups will be sup-
plied and that the main reinforcement will consist of three rows of No. 11 bars. AASHTO
requires 1 Vfc-in (38.1-mm) insulation for the stirrups and a clear distance of 1 in (25.4 mm)
between rows of bars. However, 2 in (50.8 mm) of insulation will be provided in this
instance, and the center-to-center spacing of rows will be taken as 2.5 times the bar
diameter. Then, d = 5.75 + 33.5 - 2 - 0.5 - 1.375(0.5 + 2.5) = 32.62 in (828.548 mm);

(a) Loading

FIGURE 38

v = Vlb'jd = 66,2807(14 x 0.875 x 32.62) = 166 < 225 lb/in2 (1144.6 < 1551.4 kPa). This
is acceptable.
Compute the moment capacity of the girder at balanced design. Since the concrete is
poured monolithically, the girder and slab function as a T beam. Refer to Fig. 16, Section
2 and its calculation procedure.
Thus, kbd = 0.375(32.62) = 12.23 in (310.642 mm); 12.23 - 5.75 = 6.48 in (164.592
mm). At balanced design,/cl = 1200(6.48/12.23) = 636 lb/in2 (4835.2 kPa). The effective
flange width of the T beam as governed by AASHTO is 64 in (1625.6 mm); and Cb —
5.75(64X1X2)(I^OO + 0.636) = 338 kips (1503 kN ) ;yW = 32.62 - (5.75/3)(1200 + 2 x
636)/(1200 + 636) = 30.04 in (763.016 mm); Mb = 338(30.04) = 10,150 in-kips (1146
kN-m). The concrete section is therefore slightly excessive, and the steel is stressed to ca-
pacity, orAs = 10,100/20(30.04) = 16.8 in2 (108.4 cm2). Use 11 no. 11 bars, arranged in
three rows.
AASHTO requires that the girders be tied together by diaphragms to obtain lateral
rigidity of the structure.

COMPOSITE STEEL-AND-CONCRETE BRIDGE

The bridge shown in cross section in Fig. 39 is to carry an HS20-44 loading on an effec-
tive span of 74 ft 6 in (22.7 m). The structure will be unshored during construction. The
concrete strength is 3000 lb/in2 (20,685 kPa), and the entire slab is considered structurally
effective; the allowable bending stress in the steel is 18,000 lb/in2 (124.1 MPa). The dead
load carried by the composite section is 250 Ib/lin ft (3648 N/m). Preliminary design cal-
culations indicate that the interior girder is to consist of W36 x 150 and a cover plate 1 Ox
1/2 in (254 x 38.1 mm) welded to the bottom flange. Determine whether the trial section
is adequate and complete the design.

Calculation Procedure:

1. Record the relevant properties of the W36 x 150

The design of a composite bridge consisting of a concrete slab and steel girders is gov-
erned by specific articles in the AASHTO Specification.
Composite behavior of the steel and concrete is achieved by adequately bonding the
materials to function as a flexural unit. Loads that are present before the concrete has
hardened are supported by the steel member alone; loads that are applied after hardening
are supported by the composite member. Thus, the steel alone supports the concrete slab,
and the steel and concrete jointly support the wearing surface.
Plastic flow of the concrete under sustained load generates a transfer of compressive
stress from the concrete to the steel. Consequently, the stresses in the composite member
caused by dead load are analyzed by using a modular ratio three times the value that ap-
plies for transient loads.
If a wide-flange shape is used without a cover plate, the neutral axis of the composite
section is substantially above the center of the steel, and the stress in the top steel fiber is
therefore far below that in the bottom fiber. Use of a cover plate depresses the neutral
axis, reduces the disparity between these stresses, and thereby results in a more economi-
cal section. Le t>>' = distance from neutral axis of member to given point, in absolute Val-
ue; y = distance from centroidal axis of WF shape to neutral axis of member. The sub-
scripts b, ts, and tc refer to the bottom of member, top of steel, and top of concrete,

respectively. The superscripts c and n refer to the composite and noncomposite member,
respectively.
The relevant properties of the W36 x 150 are A = 44.16 in2 (284.920 cm2); / - 9012
in4 (37.511 dm4); d = 35.84 in (910.336 mm); S = 503 in3 (8244.2 cm3); flange thickness
= 1 in (25.4 mm), approximately.

2. Compute the section moduli of the noncomposite section
where the cover plate is present

To do this, compute the static moment and moment of inertia of the section with respect
to the center of the W shape; record the results in Table 2. Refer to Fig. 40: y =
-280/59.16 = ^.73 in (-120.142 mm ) ;y 'b = 19.42-4.73 = 14.69 in (373.126 mm);y'ts =
17.92 + 4.73 = 22.65 in (575.31 mm). By the moment-of-inertia equation, / = 5228 +

3. Transform the composite
section, with cover plate
included, to an equivalent
homogeneous section of
steel; compute the
section moduli
In accordance with AASHTO, the ef-
fective flange width is 12(6.5) = 78 in
(1981.2 mm). Using the method of an
earlier calculation procedure, we see
that when n = 30, y = 78/76.06 = 1.03
in (26.162 mm); y'b = 19.42 + 1.03 =
20.45 in (519.43 mm); y'ts = 17.92 -
1.03 = 16.89 in (429.006 mm); yt'c =
16.89 + 6.50 = 23.39 in (594.106 mm);
/ = 12,802 + 9072 - 76.06(1.03)2 =

(17,471.7 cm3); Sts = 1,290 in3
(21,143.1 cm3); Stc = 932 in3 (15,275.5

When n = 10: y = 7.22 in (183.388 mm); yb = 26.64 in (676.66 mm); y'ts = 10.70 in
(271.78 mm); J^ = 17.20 in (436.88 mm); I= 27,950 + 9191 - 109.86(7.22)2 = 31,414 in4
(130.7545 dm4); Sb=ll79 in3 (19,320.3 cm3); Sts = 2936 in3 (48,121.0 cm3); Stc = 1826

4. Transform the composite section, exclusive of the cover plate,
to an equivalent homogeneous section of steel, and compute the
values shown below

Thus, when n = 30, yb = 23.78 in (604.012 mm); yt's = 12.06 in (306.324 mm); /= 14,549

6. Compute the maximum dead-load moments

Thus, M^L = (1/8)(0.250)(74.5)2(12) = 2080 in-kips (235.00 kN-m); M£L = (1A)
(0.780)(74.5)2(12) = 6490 in-kips (733.24 kN-m).

7. Compute the maximum live-load moment, with impact included

In accordance with the AASHTO, the distribution factor is DF = 6.75/5.5 = 1.23; IF = 50/
(74.5 + 125) = 0.251, and 16(1.23)(1.251) = 24.62 kips (109.510 kN); 4(1.23)(1.251) =
6.15 kips (270.355 kN); P1x+1 = 2(24.62) + 6.15 = 55.39 kips (246.375 kN). Refer to Fig.
38a as a guide. Then, M1x+1 = 12[(55.39 x 39.58 x 39.58/74.5) - 24.62(14)] = 9840
in-kips (1111.7 kN-m).

8. Compute the critical stresses in the member

To simplify the calculations, consider the sections of maximum live-load and dead-load
stresses to be coincident. Then/6 = 6490/879 + 2080/1066 + 9840/1179 = 17.68 kips/in2
(121.9 MPa);/, = 6490/570 + 2080/1290 + 9840/2936 = 16.35 kips/in2 (112.7 MPa); ftc =
20807(30 x 932) + 98407(10 x 1826) = 0.61 kips/in2 (4.21 MPa). The section is therefore
satisfactory.

9. Determine the theoretical length of cover plate

Let K denote the theoretical cutoff point at the left end. Let Lc = length of cover plate ex-
clusive of the development length; b = distance from left support to

11. Compute VDL and VLL+I at the support and at K

At the support F£>L = ^(0.25O x 74.5) = 9.31 kips (41.411 kN); IF = 0.251.
Consider that the load at the support is not subject to distribution. By applying the nec-
essary correction, the following is obtained: F1x+1 = 55.39(74.5 - 9.33)774.5 -
16(1.251)(0.23) = 43.85 kips (195.045 kN). AtK: VC
DL = 9.31 - 12.70(0.250) = 6.13 kips
(27.266 kN); IF = 50/(61.8 + 125) = 0.268; P1x+1 = 36(1.268)(1.23) = 56.15 kips (249.755
kN); FLL+I = 56.15(74.5 - 12.70 - 9.33)774.5 = 39.55 kips (175.918 kN).

12. Select the shear connectors, and determine the allowable
pitch p at the support and immediately to the right of K

Assume use of %-in (19.1-mm) studs, 4 in (101.6 mm) high, with four studs in each trans-
verse row, as shown in Fig. 41. The capacity of a connector as established by AASHTO is
110</2(/c')05 = UO x 0.752(3000)05 =
3390 Ib (15,078.7 N). The capacity of a
row of connectors = 4(3390) = 13,560 Ib
(60,314.9N).
The shear flow at the bottom of the
slab is found by applying q = VQII,
or g&L = 9310(16.90)(12.06 + 3.25)7
14,549 = 166 Ib/lin in (29,071.0 N/m);
^LL+I = 43,850(50.70)(6.61 + 3.25)7
19,779 = 1108 lb/in2 (7639.7 kPa); p =
13,5607(166 + 1108) = 10.6 in (269.24
mm).
Directly to the right of K: qfa 
-
6130(16.90)(16.89 + 3.25)721,793 =
96 lb/lin in (16,812.2 N/m); ?LL+I =
39,550(50.70)(10.70 + 3.25)731,414 =
890 lb/lin in (155,862.9 N/m); p =
13,560/(96 + 890) = 13.8 in (350.52
mm).
It is necessary to determine the allowable pitch at other sections and to devise a suit-
able spacing of connectors for the entire span.
13. Design the weld connecting the cover plate to the W shape
The calculations for shear flow are similar to those in step 12. The live-load deflection of
an unshored girder is generally far below the limit imposed by AASHTO. However,
where an investigation is warranted, the deflection at midspan may be calculated by as-
suming, for simplicity, that the position of loads for maximum deflection coincides with
the position for maximum moment. The theorem of reciprocal deflections, presented in an
earlier calculation procedure, may conveniently be applied in calculating this deflection.
The girders are usually tied together by diaphragms at the ends and at third points to ob-
tain lateral rigidity of the structure.

FLUID MECHANICS

Hydrostatics

The notational system used in hydrostatics is as follows: W= weight of floating body, Ib
(N); V= volume of displaced liquid, ft3 (m3); w = specific weight of liquid, lb/ft3 (N/m3);
for water w = 62.4 lb/ft3 (9802 N/m3), unless another value is specified.

BUOYANCYAND FLOTATION

A timber member 12 ft (3.65 m) long with a cross-sectional area of 90 in2 (580.7 cm2)
will be used as a buoy in saltwater. What volume of concrete must be fastened to one end

so that 2 ft (60.96 cm) of the member will be above the surface? Use these specific
weights: timber = 38 lb/ft3 (5969 N/m3); saltwater = 64 lb/ft3 (10,053 N/m3); concrete =
145 lb/ft3 (22,777 N/m3).

Calculation Procedure:
1. Express the weight of the body and the volume of the displaced
liquid in terms of the volume of concrete required

Archimedes' principle states that a body immersed in a liquid is subjected to a vertical
buoyant force equal to the weight of the displaced liquid. In accordance with the equa-
tions of equilibrium, the buoyant force on a floating body equals the weight of the body.
Therefore,

W= Fw 

(1)

Let x denote the volume of concrete. Then W= (90/144)(12)(38) + 145* .= 285 + 145*;
V= (90/144)(12 - 2) + jc = 6.25 + jc.

2. Substitute in Eq. 1 and solve for x

Thus, 285 + 145* = (6.25 + *)64; x = 1.42 ft3 (0.0402 m3).

HYDROSTATIC FORCE
ON A PLANE SURFACE

In Fig. I, AB is the side of a vessel containing water, and CDE is a gate located in this
plane. Find the magnitude and location of the resultant thrust of the water on the gate
when the liquid surface is 2 ft (60.96 cm) above the apex.

Calculation Procedure:
1. State the equations for the resultant magnitude and position

In Fig. 1, FH denotes the centroidal axis of area CDE that is parallel to the liquid surface,
and G denotes the point of application of the resultant force. Point G is termed the pres-
sure center.
Let A = area of given surface, ft2 (cm2); P ~ hydrostatic force on given surface, Ib (N);
pm = mean pressure on surface, lb/ft2 (kPa); yCA and ypc = vertical distance from cen-
troidal axis and pressure center, respectively, to liquid surface, ft (m); ZCA and zpc = dis-
tance along plane of given surface from the centroidal axis and pressure center, respec-
tively, to line of intersection of this plane and the liquid surface, ft (m); ICA = moment of
inertia of area with respect to its centroidal axis, ft4 (m4).
Consider an elemental surface of area dA at a vertical distance y below the liquid sur-
face. The hydrostatic force dP on this element is normal to the surface and has the magni-
tude

dP = wydA 

(2)

By applying Eq. 2 develop the following equations for the magnitude and position of
the resultant force on the entire surface:

ZPC= ^T- +ZCA 
AZCA

(3)

(4)

2. Compute the required values, and solve the equations in step 1

Thus A = 1/2(5)(6) = 15 ft2 (1.39 m2); yCA = 2 + 4 sin 60 ° = 5.464 ft (166.543 cm); ZCA = 2
esc 60° + 4 = 6.309 ft (192.3 cm); ICAIA = (bf/36)/(bd/2) = </2/18 = 2 ft2 (0.186 m2); P =
62.4(5.464)(15) = 5114 Ib (22.747 N); zpc = 2/6.309 + 6.309 = 6.626 ft (201.960 cm);
ypc = 6.626 sin 60° = 5.738 ft (174.894 cm). By symmetry, the pressure center lies on the
centroidal axis through C.
An alternative equation for P is

P=PnA 

(5)

Equation 3 shows that the mean pressure occurs at the centroid of the area. The above two
steps constitute method 1 for solving this problem. The next three steps constitute method
2.

3. Now construct the pressure "prism" associated with the area

In Fig. 2, construct the pressure prism associated with area CDE. The pressures are as fol-
lows: at apex,/? = 2w; at base,/? = (2 + 6 sin 60°)w = 7.196w.
The force P equals the volume of this prism, and its action line lies on the centroidal
plane parallel to the base. For convenience, resolve this prism into a triangular prism and
rectangular pyramid, as shown.

4. Determine P by computing the volume of the pressure prism

Thus, P = Aw[2 + 2/3(5.196)] =Aw(2 + 3.464) = 15(62.4)(5.464) = 5114 Ib (22,747 N).

5. Find the location of the resultant thrust

Compute the distance h from the top line to the centroidal plane. Then find ypc. Or, h =
[2(2/3)(6) + 3.464(3/4)(6)]/5.464 = 4.317 ft (131.582 cm); ypc = 2 + 4.317 sin 60° = 5.738 ft
(174.894cm).

HYDROSTATIC FORCE
ON A CURVED SURFACE

The cylinder in Fig. 3a rests on an inclined plane and is immersed in liquid up to its top,
as shown. Find the hydrostatic force on a 1-ft (30.48-cm) length of cylinder in terms of w
and the radius R; locate the pressure center.

Calculation Procedure:

1. Evaluate the horizontal and vertical component of the force dP
on an elemental surface having a central angle d0

Refer to Fig. 3b. Adopt this sign convention: A horizontal force is positive if directed to
the right; a vertical force is positive if directed upward. The first three steps constitute
method 1.
Evaluating dP yields dPH = wR2(sin O - sin O cos 0)

liquid above GCB - weight of real liquid above GA = weight of imaginary liquid in cylin-
drical sector AOBG and 
in prismoid, AOBF. Volume of sector AOBG =
[(17r/6)/(2Tf)](TrR2) = 1.833/?2; volume of prismoid AOBF = l/2(Q.5R)(R + \M6K) =
0.711R2; PV= wR2(l.833 + 0.717) = 2.55QwR2.

STABILITYOFA VESSEL

The boat in Fig. 4 is initially floating upright in freshwater. The total weight of the boat
and cargo is 182 long tons (1813 IcN); the center of gravity lies on the longitudinal (i.e.,
the fore-and-aft) axis of the boat and 8.6 ft (262.13 cm) above the bottom. A wind causes
the boat to list through an angle of 6° while the cargo remains stationary relative to the
boat. Compute the righting or upsetting moment (a) without applying any set equation;
(b) by applying the equation for metacentric height.

Calculation Procedure:
1. Compute the displacement volume and draft when the boat
is upright

The buoyant force passes through the center of gravity of the displaced liquid; this point
is termed the center of buoyancy. Figure 5 shows the cross section of a boat rotated
through an angle <f>. The center of buoyancy for the upright position is B; B' is the center
of buoyancy for the position shown, and G is the center of gravity of the boat and cargo.
In the position indicated in Fig. 5, the weight W and buoyant force R constitute a cou-
ple that tends to restore the boat to its upright position when the disturbing force is re-
moved; their moment is therefore termed righting. When these forces constitute a couple
that increases the rotation, their moment is said to be upsetting. The wedges 614 C and
OA 'C are termed the wedge of emersion and wedge of immersion, respectively. Let h =
horizontal displacement of center of buoyancy caused by rotation; h' = horizontal dis-
tance between centroids of wedge of emersion and wedge of immersion; V = volume of

FIGURE 4

wedge of emersion (or immersion). Then

"-^-

The displacement volume and the draft
when the boat is upright are W = 182
(2240) = 407.700 Ib (1813 N); V=WIw =
407.700/62.4 = 6530 ft3 (184.93 m3); d =
6530/[64(2O)] = 5.10 ft (155.448 cm).

2. Find h, using Eq. 6

Since <f) is relatively small, apply this ap- 
proximation: h' = 2b/3 — 2(20)/3 = 13.33 ft 
(406.298 cm), h = 1X2( IO ) ( IO tan 6°) x
(13.33)/[5.10(20)] = 0.687 ft (20.940 cm).

FIGURE 5. Location of resultant forces on
inclined vessel.

3. Compute the horizontal distance a (Fig. 5)

Thus, BG = 8.6 - 1X2(S.10) = 6.05 ft (184.404 cm); a = 6.05 sin 6° = 0.632 ft (19.263 cm).

4. Compute the moment of the vertical forces

Thus, M= W(h-a) = 407,700(0.055) = 22,400 ft-lb (30,374.4 N-m). Since h>a, the mo-
ment is righting. This constitutes the solution to part a. The remainder of this procedure is
concerned with part b.
In Fig. 5, let M denote the point of intersection of the vertical line through B' and the
line BG prolonged. Then Mis termed the metacenter associated with this position, and the
distance GM is called the metacentric height. Also BG is positive if G is above B, and GM
is positive if Mis above G. Thus, the moment of vertical forces is righting or upsetting de-
pending on whether the metacentric height is positive or negative, respectively.

5. Find the lever arm of the vertical forces

Use the relation for metacentric height:

GM= 

J-WT

,-BG 
Fcos 0

(7)

where IWL = moment of inertia of original waterline section about axis through O. Or,
IWL = C/i2)(64)(20)3 = 42,670 ft4 (368.3 m4); GM = 42,670/6530 cos 6° - 6.05 = 0.52 ft
(15.850 cm); h-a = 0.52 sin 6° = 0.054 ft (1.646 cm), which agrees closely with the pre-
vious result.

Mechanics of Incompressible Fluids

The notational system is a = acceleration; A = area of stream cross section; C = discharge

If the discharge of a flowing stream of liquid remains constant, the flow is termed
steady. Let subscripts 1 and 2 refer to cross sections of the stream, 1 being the upstream
section. From the definition of steady flow,

Q = A1 V1 =A2 V2 = constant 

(8)

This is termed the equation of continuity. Where no statement is made to the contrary, it is
understood that the flow is steady.
Conditions at two sections may be compared by applying the following equation,
which is a mathematical statement of Bernoulli' s theorem:

Figure 6b shows a cross section of the oil film, the shaded portion being an elemen-

plate relative to the other; dA = area of elemental surface; dF = shearing force on ele-
mental surface; dT = torque of dF with respect to the axis through the center of the
plate.
Applying Eq. 12, develop these equations: dF = 27To^r2 dr dO/m; dT= r dF = 27TO)IJLr2

2. Integrate the foregoing equation to obtain the resulting torque;
solve for \L

Thus,

T= 0.25 ft-lb (0.339 N-m); m = 0.08 in (2.032 mm); w = 4 r/s; R = 4.5 in (114.3 mm); /x, =
0.25(0.08)(12)3/[7T2(4)(4,5)4] = 0.00214 lb-s/ft2 (0.1025 N-s/m2).

APPLICATION OF BERNOULLI'S THEOREM

A steel pipe is discharging 10 ft3/s (283.1 L/s) of water. At section 1, the pipe diameter is
12 in (304.8 mm), the pressure is 18 lb/in2 (124.11 kPa), and the elevation is 140 ft (42.67
m). At section 2, farther downstream, the pipe diameter is 8 in (203.2 mm), and the eleva-
tion is 106 ft (32.31 m). If there is a head loss of 9 ft (2.74 m) between these sections due
to pipe friction, what is the pressure at section 2?

Calculation Procedure:
1. Tabulate the given data

Thus D1 = 12 in (304.8 mm); D2 = 8 in (203.2 mm); P1 = 18 lb/in2 (124.11 kPa); p2 = ?;
Z1 - 140 ft (42.67 m); Z2 = 106 ft (32.31 m).

2. Compute the velocity at each section

Applying Eq. 8 gives F1 = 10/0.785 = 12.7 ft/s (387.10 cm/s); F2 = 10/0.349'= 28.7 ft/s
(874.78 cm/s).

3. Compute p2 by applying Eq. 9

Thus, (p2 -P1)Iw = (F2 - Fi)/(2g) + Z1 -Z2 - hF = (12.72 - 28.72)/64.4 + 140 - 106 - 9 =
14.7 ft (448.06 cm); p2
 = 14.7(62.4)/144 + 18 = 24.4 lb/in2 (168.24 kPa).

FLOW THROUGH A VENTURI METER

A venturi meter of 3-in (76.2-mm) throat diameter is inserted in a 6-in (152.4-mm) diam-
eter pipe conveying fuel oil having a specific gravity of 0.94. The pressure at the throat is
10 lb/in2 (68.95 kPa), and that at an upstream section 6 in (152.4 mm) higher than the
throat is 14.2 lb/in2 (97.91 kPa). If the discharge coefficient of the meter is 0.97, compute
the flow rate in fallons per minute (liters per second).

Calculation Procedure:

1. Record the given data, assigning the subscript 1
to the upstream section and 2 to the throat

The loss of head between two sections can be taken into account by introducing a dis-
charge coefficient C. This coefficient represents the ratio between the actual discharge Q
and the discharge Q1 that would occur in the absence of any losses. Then Q = CQ1, or (F2
-Ff)/(2g) = CV
Record the given data: D1 = 6 in (152.4 mm); P1 = 14.2 lb/in2 (97.91 kPa); Z1 = 6 in
(152.4 mm); D2 = 3 in (76.2 mm);p2 = 10 lb/in2 (68.95 kPa); Z2 = O; C = 0.97.

2. Express V1 in terms of V2 and develop velocity
and flow relations

Thus,

4. Compute Q by applying Eq. 14b

Thus, (A2IA1)2 = (D2ID1)4 = 1Xi6; A2 = 0.0491 ft2 (0.00456 m2); and Q = 0.97(0.049)[64.4
x 10.87(1 - 1Xw)]0-5 = 1.30 ft3/s or, by using the conversion factor of 1 fWs = 449 gal/min
(28.32 L/s), the flow rate is 1.30(449) = 584 gal/min (36.84 L/s).

FLOW THROUGH AN ORIFICE

Compute the discharge through a 3-in (76.2-mm) diameter square-edged orifice if the wa-
ter on the upstream side stands 4 ft 8 in (1.422 m) above the center of the orifice.

Calculation Procedure:

1. Determine the discharge coefficient

For simplicity, the flow through a square-edged orifice discharging to the atmosphere is
generally computed by equating the area of the stream to the area of the opening and then
setting the discharge coefficient C = 0.60 to allow for contraction of the issuing stream.
(The area of the issuing stream is about 0.62 times that of the opening.)

2. Compute the flow rate

Since the velocity of approach is negligible, use Eq. I5b. Or, Q = 0.60(0.0491)(64.4 x
4.67)0-5 = 0.511 fWs (14.4675 L/s).

FLOW THROUGH THE SUCTION PIPE
OFA DRAINAGE PUMP

Water is being evacuated from a sump through the suction pipe shown in Fig. 7. The en-
trance-end diameter of the pipe is 3 ft (91.44 cm); the exit-end diameter, 1.75 ft (53.34
cm). The exit pressure is 12.9 in (32.77 cm) of mercury vacuum. The head loss at the en-
try is one-fifteenth of the velocity head at that point, and the head loss in the pipe due to
friction is one-tenth of the velocity head at the exit. Compute the discharge flow rate.

Calculation Procedure:

1. Convert the pressure head to feet of water

The discharge may be found by comparing the conditions at an upstream point 1, where
the velocity is negligible, with the conditions at point 3 (Fig. 7). Select the elevation of
point 1 as the datum.
Converting the pressure head at point 3 to
feet of water and using the specific gravity
of mercury as 13.6, we have p3/w =
-(12.9/12)13.6 = - 14.6 ft (-4.45 m).

2. Express the velocity head at 2
in terms of that at 3

By the equation of continuity, V2 = A3V3IA2 =
(1.75/3)2V3 = 0.34F3.

3. Evaluate V3 by applying Eq. 9; then determine Q

Thus, V\l(2g) +pjw = Vll(2g) + P3lw + Z3 + (1Xi5)F2V^g) + (1Xi0)F3V^g), or O + 4 + O =

POWER OFA FLOWING LIQUID

A pump is discharging 8 fWs (226.5 L/s) of water. Gages attached immediately upstream
and downstream of the pump indicate a pressure differential of 36 lb/in2 (248.2 kPa). If
the pump efficiency is 85 percent, what is the horsepower output and input?

Calculation Procedure:
1. Evaluate the increase in head of the liquid

Power is the rate of performing work, or the amount of work performed in a unit time. If
the fluid flows with a specific energy H9 the total energy of the fluid discharged in a unit
time is QwH. This expression thus represents the work that the flowing fluid can perform
in a unit time and therefore the power associated with this discharge. Since 1 hp = 550
ft-lb/s,

QwH
l h p= ^- 

(16)

In this situation, the power developed by the pump is desired. Therefore, H must be
equated to the specific energy added by the pump.
To evaluate the increase in head, consider the differences of the two sections being
considered. Since both sections have the same velocity and elevation, only their pressure
heads differ. Thus,^2/"7 -Pi/w = 36(144)762.4 = 83.1 ft (2532.89 cm).

2. Compute the horsepower output and input

Thus, hpout = 8(62.4)(83.1)/550 = 75.4 hp; hpin = 75.4/0.85 = 88.7 hp.

DISCHARGE OVER A SHARP-EDGED WEIR

Compute the discharge over a sharp-edged rectangular weir 4 ft (121.9 cm) high and 10 ft
(304.8 cm) long, with two end contractions, if the water in the canal behind the weir is 4 ft
9 in (144.78 cm) high. Disregard the velocity of approach.

Calculation Procedure:
1. Adopt a standard relation for this weir

The discharge over a sharp-edged rectangular weir without end contractions in which the
velocity of approach is negligible is given by the Francis formula as

Q = 3.33bh1-5 

(lid)

where b = length of crest and h = head on weir, i.e., the difference between the elevation
of the crest and that of the water surface upstream of the weir.

2. Modify the Francis equation for end contractions

With two end contractions, the discharge of the weir is

g = 3.33(6-0.2/0/*15 

(Ub)

Substituting the given values yields Q = 3.33(10 - 0.2 x 0.7S)OJS1-5 = 21.3 ftVs (603.05
L/s).

LAMINAR FLOW IN A PIPE

A tank containing crude oil discharges 340 gal/min (21.4 L/s) through a steel pipe 220 ft
(67.1 m) long and 8 in (203.2 mm) in diameter. The kinematic viscosity of the oil is 0.002
ft2/s (1.858 cm2/s). Compute the difference in elevation between the liquid surface in the
tank and the pipe outlet.

Calculation Procedure:

1. Identify the type of flow in the pipe

To investigate the discharge in a pipe, it is necessary to distinguish between two types of
fluid flow—laminar and turbulent. Laminar (or viscous) flow is characterized by the tele-
scopic sliding of one circular layer of fluid past the adjacent layer, each fluid particle tra-
versing a straight line. The velocity of the fluid flow varies parabolically from zero at the
pipe wall to its maximum value at the pipe center, where it equals twice the mean veloci-
ty.

Turbulent flow is characterized by the formation of eddy currents, with each fluid par-
ticle traversing a sinuous path.
In any pipe the type of flow is ascertained by applying a dimensionless index termed
the Reynolds number, defined as

DV

R

Flow is considered laminar if N
 < 2100 and turbulent is N

*-(№№

(18)

(19«)

Let 1 denote a point on the liquid surface and 2 a point at the pipe outlet. The elevation of
2 will be taken as datum.

To identify the type of flow, compute NR. Thus, D = 8 in (203.2 mm); L = 220 ft (6705.6
cm); v = 0.002 ft2/s (1.858 cm2/s); Q = 340/449 = 0.757, converting from gallons per
minute to cubic feet per second. Then V= QIA = 0.757/0.349 = 2.17 ft/s (66.142 cm/s). And
NR = 0.667(2.17)/0.002 = 724. Therefore, the flow is laminar because NR is less than 2100.

2. Express all losses in terms of the velocity head

By Eq. 196, hF = (64/724)(220/0.667)F2/(2g) = 29.2 V2IVg). Where LID > 500, the fol-
lowing may be regarded as negligible in comparison with the loss due to friction: loss at
pipe entrance, losses at elbows, velocity head at the discharge, etc. In this instance, in-
clude the secondary items. The loss at the pipe entrance is hE = 0.5 V2IQg). The total loss
is /*L = 29.7F2/(2g).

3. Find the elevation of 1 by applying Eq. 9

Thus, Z1 = Ff/(2g) + hL = 30.7F|/(2g) = 30.7(2.17)2/64.4 = 2.24 ft (68.275 cm).

TURBULENT FLOW IN PIPE-APPLICATION
OF DARCY-WEISBACH FORMULA

Water is pumped at the rate of 3 ft3/s (85.0 L/s) through an 8-in (203.2-mm) fairly smooth
pipe 2600 ft (792.48 m) long to a reservoir where the water surface is 180 ft (50.86 m)
higher than the pump. Determine the gage pressure at the pump discharge.

Weisbach formula for friction head

manner implied by this equation, / is dependent on D and V9 as well as the degree of

Using Eq. 216 gives V= QIA = 3/0.349 = 8.60 ft/s (262.128 cm/s); hF = 0.38(2.6)
(8.60)L86/0.667L25 - 89.7 ft (27.34 m).

2. Alternatively, determine hF using Eq. 20

First obtain the appropriate/value from Fig. 8, o r /= 0.020 for this pipe. Then hF =
0.020(2.600/0.667)(8.602/64.4) = 89.6 ft (27.31 m).

3. Compute the pressure at the pump discharge

Use Eq. 9. Since LID > 500, ignore the secondary items. Then/Vw = Z2 + hF = 180 + 89.6
= 269.6 ft (82.17 Tn)9P1 = 269.6(62.4)7144 = 1 17 lb/in2 (806.7 kPa).

DETERMINATION OF FLOW IN A PIPE

Two reservoirs are connected by a 7000-ft (2133.6-m) fairly smooth cast-iron pipe 10 in
(254.0 mm) in diameter. The difference in elevation of the water surfaces is 90 ft
(27.4 m). Compute the discharge to the lower reservoir.

Calculation Procedure:
1. Determine the fluid velocity and flow rate

Since the secondary items are negligible, the entire head loss of 90 ft (27.4 m) results
from friction. Using Eq. 216 and solving for F, we have 90 = 0.38(7)FL86/0.833L25;
V= 5.87 ft/s (178.918 cm/s). Then Q=VA = 5.87(0.545) = 3.20 ft3/s (90.599 L/s).

2. Alternatively, assume a value of f and compute V

Referring to Fig. 8, select a value for/ Then compute V by applying Eq. 20. Next, com-
pare the value of/corresponding to this result with the assumed value of/ If the two val-
ues differ appreciably, assume a new value of/and repeat the computation. Continue this
process until the assumed and actual values of/agree closely.

PIPE-SIZE SELECTION BY
THE MANNING FORMULA

A cast-iron pipe is to convey water at 3.3 ft3/s (93.430 L/s) on a grade of 0.001. Applying
the Manning formula with n- 0.013, determine the required size of pipe.

Calculation Procedure:
1. Compute the pipe diameter

The Manning formula, which is suitable for both open and closed conduits, is

v__ MS(H^ 
n

(22)

where n = roughness coefficient; R = hydraulic radius = ratio of cross-sectional area of
pipe to the wetted perimeter of the pipe; s = hydraulic gradient = dH/dL. If the flow is uni-
form, i.e., the area and therefore the velocity are constant along the stream, then the loss
of head equals the drop in elevation, and the grade of the conduit is s.
For a circular pipe flowing full, Eq. 22 becomes

/2 .1590«  /8

D=(-^-) 

(22a)

Substituting numerical values gives D = (2.159 x 3.3 x 0.013/0.0011/2)3/8 = 1.50 ft (45.72
cm). Therefore, use an 18-in (457.2-mm) diameter pipe.

LOSS OF HEAD CAUSED BY SUDDEN
ENLARGEMENT OF PIPE

Water flows through a pipe at 4 ft3/s (113.249 L/s). Compute the loss of head resulting
from a change in pipe size if (a) the pipe diameter increases abruptly from 6 to 10 in
(152.4 to 254.0 mm); (b) the pipe diameter increases abruptly from 6 to 8 in (152.4 to
203.2 mm) at one section and then from 8 to 10 in (203.2 to 254.0 mm) at a section farther
downstream.

Calculation Procedure:
1. Evaluate the pressure-head differential required to decelerate
the liquid

Where there is an abrupt increase in pipe size, the liquid must be decelerated upon enter-
ing the larger pipe, since the fluid velocity varies inversely with area. Let subscript 1 refer
to a section immediately downstream of the enlargement, where the higher velocity pre-
vails, and let subscript 2 refer to a section farther downstream, where deceleration has
been completed. Disregard the frictional loss.
Using Eq. 11 we seep2/w ^p1Iw+ (V1V2- V%)/g.

2. Combine the result of step 1 with Eq. 9

The result is Borda's formula for the head loss hE caused by sudden enlargement of the
pipe cross section:

( ^ i -K2)2

(23)

As this investigation shows, only part of the drop in velocity head is accounted for by
a gain in pressure head. The remaining head hE is dissipated through the formation of
eddy currents at the entrance to the larger pipe.

3. Compute the velocity in each pipe

Thus

Pipe diam, in (mm) 

Pipe area, ft2 (m2) 

Fluid velocity, ft/s (cm/s)

20.4(621.79)
11.5 (350.52)
7.3 (222.50)

4. Find the head loss for part a

Thus, hE = (20.4 - 7.3)2/64.4 = 2.66 ft (81.077 cm).

5. Find the head loss for part b

Thus, HE = [(20.4 - 11.5)2 + (11.5- 7.3)2]/64.4 = 1.50 ft (45.72 cm). Comparison of these
results indicates that the eddy-current loss is attenuated if the increase in pipe size occurs
in steps.

DISCHARGE OFLOOPING PIPES

A pipe carrying 12.5 ft3/s (353.90 L/s) of water branches into three pipes of the following
diameters and lengths; D1 = 6 in (152.4 mm); L1 = 1000 ft (304.8 m); D2 = 8 in (203.2
mm); L2 = 1300 ft (396.2 m); D3 = 10 in (254.0 mm); L3 = 1200 ft (365.8 m). These pipes
rejoin at their downstream ends. Compute the discharge in the three pipes, considering
each as fairly smooth.

Calculation Procedure:
1. Express Q as a function of D and L

Since all fluid particles have the same energy at the juncture point, irrespective of the
loops they traversed, the head losses in the three loops are equal. The flow thus divides it-
self in a manner that produces equal values of hF in the loops.
Transforming Eq. 2 IZ ?,

2. Establish the relative values of the discharges; then determine
the actual values

Thus, Q2IQ1 = (8/6)267/1.30538 = 1.87; Q3SQ1 = (10/6)267/1.20538 = 3.55. Then Q1 + Q2 +
Qi = Si(I + 1.87 + 3.55) = 12.5 ft3/s (353.90 L/s). Solving gives Q1 = 1.95 ft3/s (55.209
L/s); Q2 = 3.64 ft3/s (103.056 L/s); Q3 = 6.91 ft3/s (195.637 L/s).

FLUID FLOW IN BRANCHING PIPES

The pipes AM, MB, and MC in Fig. 9 have the diameters and lengths indicated. Compute
the water flow in each pipe if the pipes are considered rough.

Calculation Procedure:
1. Write the basic equations governing the discharges

Let subscripts 1 ,2, and 3 refer to AM9 MB9 and MC, respectively. Then hFi + Hp2 =110;
hFl + Hp3= 150, Eq. a; Q1 = Q2 + Q3, Eq. b.

test the result

Use Eqs. a and 25 to find the discharges. Test the results for compliance with Eq. b. If we
assume hFl = 70 ft (21.3 m), then Hp2 = 40 ft (12.2 m) and Hp3 = 80 ft (24.4 m); Q1 =

FIGURE 9. Branching pipes.

38.7(0.833)264(70/8000)0513 = 2.10 ft3/s (59.455 L/s). Similarly, Q2 = 1.12 ft3/s (31.710
L/s) and q3 = 0.83 ft3/s (23.499 L/s); Q2 + Q3 = 1.95 < Q1. The assumed value of hFl is ex-
cessive.

4. Make another assumption for hF1 and the corresponding
revisions

Assume hFl = 66 ft (20.1 m). Then ^1 = 2.10(66/7O)0513 = 2.04 ft3/s (57.757 L/s). Simi-
larly, Q2 = 1.18 ft3/s (33.408 L/s); ft = 0.85 ft3/s (24.065 L/s). G2 + 6s = 2.03 ft3/s
(57.736 L/s). These results may be accepted as sufficiently precise.

UNIFORM FLOW IN OPEN CHANNEL-
DETERMINATION OF SLOPE

It is necessary to convey 1200 ft3/s (33,974.6 L/s) of water from a dam to a power plant in
a canal of rectangular cross section, 24 ft (7.3 m) wide and 10 ft (3.0 m) deep, having a
roughness coefficient of 0.016. The canal is to flow full. Compute the required slope of
the canal in feet per mile (meters per kilometer).

Calculation Procedure:

1. Apply Eq. 22

Thus, A = 24(10) - 240 ft2 (22.3 m2); wetted perimeter = WP = 24 + 2(10) = 44 ft
(13.4 m); R = 240/44 = 5.45 ft (1.661 m); V = 1200/240 = 5 ft/s (152.4 cm/s); s =
[nV/(1.486R2/3)]2 - [0.016 x 5/(1.486 x 5.452/3)]2 = 0.000302; slope = 0.000302(5280
ft/mi) = 1.59 ft/mi (0.302 m/km).

REQUIRED DEPTH OF CANAL FOR
SPECIFIED FLUID FLOW RATE

A trapezoidal canal is to carry water at 800 ft3/s (22,649.7 L/s). The grade of the canal is
0.0004; the bottom width is 25 ft (7.6 m); the slope of the sides is I1A horizontal to 1 ver-

FIGURE 10

is 0.014.
Compute the required depth of the canal, to
the nearest tenth of a foot.

Calculation Procedure:

1" Transform £<7- 22 and compute

A f u^
Thus, AR2'3 = «e/(1.486s1/2), Eq. 226. Or,
AR2/3 = 0.014(800)/[1.486(0.0004)1/2] = 377.

2. Express the area and wetted perimeter in terms of D (Fig. 10)

Side of canal = D(I2 + 1.52)0 5 = 1.8OD. A = D(25 + 1.5D); WP = 25 + 36OD.

3. Assume the trial values of D until Eq. 22b is satisfied

Thus, assume D = 5 ft (152.4 cm); A = 162.5 ft2 (15.10 m2); WP = 43 ft (1310.6 cm); R =
3.78 ft (115.2 cm); ARm = 394. The assumed value of D is therefore excessive because
the computed AR2/3 is greater than the value computed in step 1.
Next, assume a lower value for D, or D = 4.9 ft (149.35 cm); A = 158.5 ft2 (14.72 m2);
WP = 42.64 ft (1299.7 cm); R = 3.72 ft (113.386 cm); AR2/3 = 381. This is acceptable.
Therefore, D = 4.9 ft (149.35 cm).

ALTERNATE STAGES OF FLOW;
CRITICAL DEPTH

A rectangular channel 20 ft (609.6 cm) wide is to discharge 500 ftVs (14,156.1 L/s) of
water having a specific energy of 4.5 ft-lb/lb (1.37 J/N). (a) Using n = 0.013, compute the
required slope of the channel, (b) Compute the maximum potential discharge associated
with the specific energy of 4.5 ft-lb/lb (1.37 J/N). (c) Compute the minimum of specific
energy required to maintain a flow of 500 fWs (14,156.1 L/s).

Calculation Procedure:

1. Evaluate the specific energy of an elemental mass of liquid
at a distance z above the channel bottom

To analyze the discharge conditions at a given section in a channel, it is advantageous to
evaluate the specific energy (or head) by taking the elevation of the bottom of the channel
at the given section as datum. Assume a uniform velocity across the section, and let D =
depth of flow, ft (cm); H6 = specific energy as computed in the prescribed manner; Q11 =
discharge through a unit width of channel, ft3(s-ft) [L/(s-cm)].
Evaluating the specific energy of an elemental mass of liquid at a given distance z
above the channel bottom, we get

H--$;+D 

w

Thus, H6 is constant across the entire section. Moreover, if the flow is uniform, as it is
here, H6 is constant along the entire stream.

2. Apply the given values and solve for D

Thus, He = 4.5 fHb/lb (1.37 J/N); Qu = 500/20 = 25 ft3/(s-ft) [2323 L/(s-m)]. Rearrange
Eq. 26 to obtain

&(He -D)= -^- 

(26«)

Or, D2(4.5 -D) = 252/64.4 = 9.705. This cubic equation has two positive roots, D = 1.95
ft (59.436 cm) and D = 3.84 ft (117.043 cm). There are therefore two stages of flow that
accommodate the required discharge with the given energy. [The third root of the equa-
tion is D = -1.29 ft (-39.319 cm), an impossible condition.]

3. Compute the slope associated with the computed depths

Using Eq. 22, at the lower stage we have D = 1.95 ft (59.436 cm); A = 20(1.95) = 39.0 ft2
(36,231.0 cm2); WP = 20 + 2(1.95) = 23.9 ft (728.47 cm); R = 39.0/23.9 = 1.63 ft (49.682
cm); V= 25/1.95 = 12.8 ft/s (390.14 cm/s); s = [«F/(1.486tf2/3)]2 = (0.013 x 12.8/1.486 x
1.63273)2 = 0.00654.
At the upper stage D = 3.84 ft (117.043 cm); A = 20(3.84) = 76.8 ft2 (71,347.2 cm2);
WP = 20 + 2(3.84) = 27.68 ft (843.686 cm); R = 76.8/27.68 = 2.77 ft (84.430 cm); V =
25/3.84 = 6.51 ft/s (198.4 cm/s); s = [0.013 x 6.517(1.486 x 2.772/3)]2 = 0.000834. This
constitutes the solution to part a.

4. Plot the D-QU curve

For part b, consider He as remaining constant at 4.5 ft-lb/lb (1.37 J/N) while Qu varies.
Plot the D-QU curve as shown in Fig. 1 Ia. The depth that provides the maximum potential
discharge is called the critical depth with respect to the given specific energy.

part b.

6. Plot the D-H0 curve

For part c, consider Qu as remaining constant at 25 ft3/(s-ft) [2323 L/(s-m)] while H0
varies. Plot the D-H6 curve as shown in Fig. UZ?. (This curve is asymptotic with the
straight lines D = H6 and D = 0.) The depth at which the specific energy is minimum is
called the critical depth with respect to the given unit discharge.

evaluate f/e,m/n

Differentiating gives

encroachment of backwater, or some other factor. The deceleration of liquid requires an
increase in hydrostatic pressure, but only part of the drop in velocity head is accounted
for by a gain in pressure head. The excess head is dissipated in the formation of a
turbulent standing wave. Thus, the phenomenon of hydraulic jump resembles the be-
havior of liquid in a pipe at a sudden enlargement, as analyzed in an earlier calculation
procedure.
Let D1 and D2 denote the depth of flow immediately upstream and downstream
of the jump, respectively. Then D1 < Dc < D2. Refer to Fig. lib. Since the hydraulic
jump is accompanied by a considerable drop in energy, the point on the D-He dia-
gram that represents D2 lies both above and to the left of that representing D1. There-
fore, the upstream depth is less than the depth that would exist in the absence of any
loss.
Using literal values, apply Eq. 11 to find the difference in hydrostatic forces per unit
width of channel that is required to decelerate the liquid. Solve the resulting equation for
D1:

Substituting yields QlKgD3) = 282/(32.2 x 3.23) = 0.743; dDldL = (0.0010 - 0.0004)/(1 -
0.743) = 0.00233 ft/ft (0.00233 m/m). The depth is increasing in the downstream direc-
tion, and the water is therefore being decelerated.
As Eq. 3 IZ? reveals, the relationship between the actual depth at a given section and the
critical depth serves as a criterion in ascertaining whether the depth is increasing or de-
creasing.

DISCHARGE BETWEEN COMMUNICATING
VESSELS

In Fig. 13, liquid is flowing from tank A to tank B through an orifice near the bottom. The
area of the liquid surface is 200 ft2 (18.58 m2) in A and 150 ft2 (13.93 m2) in B. Initially,
the difference in water levels is 1.4 ft (4.3 m), and the discharge is 2 ft3/s (56.6 L/s). As-
suming that the discharge coefficient remains constant, compute the time required for the
water level in tank A to drop 1.8 ft (0.54 m).

VARIATION IN HEAD ON A WEIR WITHOUT
INFLOW TO THE RESERVOIR

Water flows over a weir of 60-ft (18.3-m) length from a reservoir having a surface area of
50 acres (202,350 m2). If the inflow to the reservoir ceases when the head on the weir is 2
ft (0.6 m), what will the head be at the expiration of 1 h? Consider that the instantaneous
discharge is given by Eq. Ila.

Calculation Procedure:

1. Develop the time-interval equation

Let A = surface area of reservoir and C = numerical constant in discharge equation; and
subscripts 1 and 2 refer to the beginning and end, respectively, of a time interval t. By ex-
pressing the change in head during an elemental time interval,

2. Substitute numerical values in Eq, 33; solve for H2

Thus, A = 50(43,560) = 2,178,000 ft2 (202,336.2 m2); t = 3600 s; solving gives h2 = 1.32
ft (0.402 m).

VARIATION IN HEAD ON A WEIR
WITH INFLOW TO THE RESERVOIR

Water flows over an 80-ft (24.4-m) long weir from a reservoir having a surface area of
6,000,000 ft2 (557,400.0 m2) while the rate of inflow to the reservoir remains constant at
2175 fWs (61,578.9 L/s). How long will it take for the head on the weir to increase from
zero to 95 percent of its maximum value? Consider that the instantaneous rate of flow
over the weir is 3Abh1-5.

Calculation Procedure:

1. Compute the maximum head on the weir by equating
outflow to inflow

The water in the reservoir reaches its maximum height when equilibrium is achieved, i.e.,
when the rate of outflow equals the rate of inflow. Let Q1 = rate of inflow; Q0 = rate of
outflow at a given instant; t = time elapsed since the start of the outflow.
Equating outflow to inflow yields 3.4(8OAJ^x) = 2175; /zmax = 4.0 ft (1.2 m); 0.95/zmax
= 3.8 ft (1.16m).

2. Using literal values, determine the time interval dt during which
the water level rises a distance dh

Thus, with C = numerical constant in the discharge equation,

(34)

The right side of this equation is not amenable to direct integration. Consequently, the
only feasible way of computing the time is to perform an approximate integration.

3. Obtain the approximate value of the required time

Select suitable increments of /*, calculate the corresponding increments of /, and total the
latter to obtain an approximate value of the required time. In calculating Q0, apply the
mean value of h associated with each increment.

The precision inherent in the result thus obtained depends on the judgment used in se-
lecting the increments of /*, and a clear visualization of the relationship between h and t is
essential. Let m = dtldh = AI(Q1 — CM1-5). The m-h curve is shown in Fig. 14a. Then, t =
Jm dh = area between the m-h curve and h axis.
This area is approximated by summing the areas of the rectangles as indicated in Fig.
14, the length of each rectangle being equal to the value of m at the center of the interval.
Note that as h increases, the increments Ah should be made progressively smaller to min-
imize the error introduced in the procedure.
Select the increments shown in Table 1, and perform the indicated calculations. The
symbols hb and hm denote the values of h at the beginning and center, respectively, of an
interval. The following calculations for the third interval illustrate the method: hm = l/2(2.0
+ 2.8) = 2.4 ft (0.73 m); m = 6,000,0007(2175 - 3.4 x 80 x 2.415) = 5160 s/ft (16,929.1
s/m); At = m Ah = 5160(0.8) = 4130 s. From Table 1 the required time is t = 24,090 s =
6 H 4 1 .5 min.
The t-h curve is shown in Fig. I4b. The time required for the water to reach its maxi-
mum height is difficult to evaluate with precision because m becomes infinitely large as h
approaches /*max; that is, the water level rises at an imperceptible rate as it nears its limit-
ing position.

DIMENSIONAL ANALYSIS METHODS

The velocity of a raindrop in still air is known or assumed to be a function of these quan-
tities: gravitational acceleration, drop diameter, dynamic viscosity of the air, and the den-
sity of both the water and the air. Develop the dimensionless parameters associated with
this phenomenon.

Calculation Procedure:

1. Using a generalized notational system, record the units
in which the six quantities of this situation are expressed

Dimensional analysis is an important tool both in theoretical investigations and in experi-
mental work because it clarifies the relationships intrinsic in a given situation.
A quantity that appears in every dimensionless parameter is termed repeating; a quan-
tity that appears in only one parameter is termed nonrepeating. Since the engineer is usu-
ally more accustomed to dealing with units offeree rather than of mass, the force-length-

time system of units is applied here. Let F, L, and T denote units of force, length, and
time, respectively.
By using this generalized notational system, it is convenient to write the appropriate
USCS units and then replace these with the general units. For example, with respect to ac-
celeration: USCS units, ft/s2; general units, LIT2 or LT~2. Similarly, with respect to densi-
ty (wig): USCS units, (Ib/ft3)/(ft/s2); general units, FZrVLI7-2 or FL-4T2.
The results are shown in the following table.

pw = water density 
pa = air density

2. Compute the number of dimensionless parameters present

This phenomenon contains six physical quantities and three units. Therefore, as a conse-
quence of Buckingham's pi theorem, the number of dimensionless parameters is 6 - 3 =
3.

3. Select the repeating quantities

The number of repeating quantities must equal the number of units (three here). These
quantities should be independent, and they should collectively contain all the units pres-
ent. The quantities g, D9 and /*,a satisfy both requirements and therefore are selected as the
repeating quantities.

4. Select the dependent variable V as the first nonrepeating
quantity

Then write Tr1 = g^^F, Eq. a, where Tr1 is a dimensionless parameter and Jt, y, and z are
unknown exponents that may be evaluated by experiment.

5. Transform Eq. a to a dimensional equation

Do this by replacing each quantity with the units in which it is expressed. Then perform
the necessary expansions and multiplications. Or, F0L0T70 = (LT-2yLy x

HYDRAULIC SIMILARITYAND
CONSTRUCTION OF MODELS

A dam discharges 36,000 ft3/s (1,019,236.7 L/s) of water, and a hydraulic pump occurs on
the apron. The power loss resulting from this jump is to be determined by constructing a
geometrically similar model having a scale of 1:12. (a) Determine the required discharge
in the model, (b) Determine the power loss on the dam if the power loss on the model is
found to be 0.18 hp (0.134 kW).

Calculation Procedure:
1. Determine the value of Qm

Two systems are termed similar if their corresponding variables have a constant ratio. A
hydraulic model and its prototype must possess three forms of similarity: geometric, or
similarity of shape; kinematic, or similarity of motion; and dynamic, or similarity of
forces.
In the present instance, the ratio associated with the geometric similarity is given, i.e.,
the ratio of a linear dimension in the model to the corresponding linear dimension in the
prototype. Let rg denote this ratio, and let subscripts m andp refer to the model and proto-
type, respectively.
Apply Eq. Ua to evaluate Qm. Or Q = C1Z?/*15, where C1 is a constant. Then QJQP =
(bmlhp)(bmlhp)^. But bmlbp = hmlhp = rg; therefore, QJQp = ^= (Vi2)2-5 = 1/499; Qm =
36,000/499 = 72 ftVs (2038.5 L/s).

2. Evaluate the power loss on the dam

Apply Eq. 16 to evaluate the power loss on the dam. Thus, hp = C2Qh7 where C2 is a con-
stant. Then hP//hpw = (QJQ1n)(H^h1n). But Qp/Qm = (l/rg)2-5, and hjhm = l/rg; therefore,
hp/ip™ = (l/^)3 5 = 123/= 5990. Hence, hpp = 5990(0.18) = 1078 hp (803.86 kW).

(bmlhp)(bmlhp)^. But bmlbp = hmlhp = rg; therefore, QJQp = ^= (Vi2)2-5 = 1/499; Qm =

2. Evaluate the power loss on the dam

Apply Eq. 16 to evaluate the power loss on the dam. Thus, hp = C2Qh7 where C2 is a con-

2. Analyze the proposed pumps

To analyze properly the proposal, a new set of curves, Fig. 16, is required. For the pro-
posed series pumping application, it is necessary to establish a seriesedpump curve. This
is a plot of the head and flow rate (capacity) which exists when both pumps are running in
series. To construct this curve, double the single-pump head values at any given flow rate.
Next, to determine accurately the flow a single pump can deliver, plot the system-head
curve using the same method fully described in the next calculation procedure. This curve
is also plotted on Fig. 16.

Plot the point of operation for each pump on the seriesed curve, Fig. 16. The point of
operation of each pump is on the single-pump curve when both pumps are operating.
Each pump supplies half the total required head.
When a single pump is running, the point of operation will be at the intersection of the
system-head curve and the single-pump characteristic curve, Fig. 16. At this point both
the flow and the hp (kW) input of the single pump decrease. Series pumping, Fig. 16, re-
quires the input motor hp (kW) for both pumps; this is the point of maximum power in-
put.

3. Compute the possible savings

If the system requires a constant flow of 45 gal/min (2.84 L/s) at 26-ft (7.9-m) head the
two-pump series installation saves (0.75 hp - 2 x 0.25 hp) = 0.25 hp (0.19 kW) for every
hour the pumps run. For every 1000 hours of operation, the system saves 190 kWh. Since
2000 hours are generally equal to one shift of operation per year, the saving is 380 kWh
per shift per year.
If the load is frequently less than peak, one-pump operation delivers 32.5 gal/min (2.1
L/s). This value, which is some 72 percent of nail load, corresponds to doubling the sav-
ing.
Related Calculations. Series operation of pumps can be used in a variety of designs
for industrial, commercial, residential, chemical, power, marine, and similar plants. A se-
ries connection of pumps is especially suitable when full-load demand is small; i.e., just a
few hours a week, month, or year. With such a demand, one pump can serve the plant's
needs most of the time, thereby reducing the power bill. When full-load operation is re-
quired, the second pump is started. If there is a need for maintenance of the first pump,
the second unit is available for service.
This procedure is the work of Jerome F. Mueller, P.E., of Mueller Engineering Corp.

PARALLEL PUMPING ECONOMICS

A system requires a flow of 80 gal/min (7.4 L/s) of 20O0F (92.50C) water at a 2O0F (360C)
temperature drop and a 13-ft (3.96-m) system head. The required system flow can be han-
dled by two pumps, one an operating unit and one a spare unit. Each pump will have an
0.5-hp (0.37-kW) drive motor. Could there be any appreciable energy saving using some
other arrangement? The system requires 50 hours of constant pump operation and 40
hours of partial pump operation per week.

Calculation Procedure:
1. Plot characteristic curves for the proposed system

Figure 17 shows the proposed pump selection. Looking at the values of the pump head
and capacity in Fig. 17, it can be seen that if the peak load of 80 gal/min (7.4 L/s) were
carried by two pumps, then each would have to pump only 40 gal/min (3.7 L/s) in a paral-
lel arrangement.

2. Plot a characteristic curve for the pumps in parallel

Construct the paralleled-pump curve by doubling the flow of a single pump at any given
head, using data from the pump manufacturer. At 13-ft head (3.96-m) one pump produces
40 gal/min (3.7 L/s); two pumps 80 gal/min (7.4 L/s). The resulting curve is shown in Fig.
18.

The load for this system could be divided among three, four, or more pumps, if de-
sired. To achieve the best results, the number of pumps chosen should be based on
achieving the proper head and capacity requirements in the system.

3. Construct a system-head curve

Based on the known flow rate, 80 gal/min (7.4 L/s) at 13-ft (3.96-m) head, a system-head
curve can be constructed using the fact that pumping head varies as the square of the
change in flow, or Q2IQi = H2IH1, where Q1 = known design flow, gal/min (L/s); Q2 = se-
lected flow, gal/min (L/s); HI = known design head, ft (m); H2 = resultant head related to
selected flow rate, gal/min (L/s).
Figure 19 shows the plotted system-head curve. Once the system-head curve is plot-
ted, draw the single-pump curve from Fig. 17 on Fig. 19, and the paralleled-pump curve
from Fig. 18. Connect the different pertinent points of concern with dashed lines, Fig. 19.
The point of crossing of the two-pump curve and the system-head curve is at the re-
quired value of 80 gal/min (7.4 L/s) and 13-ft (3.96-m) head because it was so planned.
But the point of crossing of the system-head curve and the single-pump curve is of partic-
ular interest.
The single pump, instead of delivering 40 gal/min (7.4 L/s) at 13-ft (3.96-m) head will
deliver, as shown by the intersection of the curves in Fig. 19, 72 gal/min (6.67 L/s) at 10-ft
(3.05-m) head. Thus, the single pump can effectively be a standby for 90 percent of the re-
quired capacity at a power input of 0.5 hp (0.37 kW). Much of the time in heating and air
conditioning, and frequently in industrial processes, the system load is 90 percent, or less.

4. Determine the single-pump horsepower input

In the installation here, the pumps are the inline type with non-overload motors. For larg-
er flow rates, the pumps chosen would be floor-mounted units providing a variety of

horsepower (kW) and flow curves. The horsepower (kW) for—say a 200-gal/min (18.6
L/s) flow rate would be about half of a 400-gal/min (37.2 L/s) flow rate.
If a pump were suddenly given a 300-gal/min (27.9 L/s) flow-rate demand at its cross-
ing point on a larger system-head curve, the hp required might be excessive. Hence, the
pump drive motor must be chosen carefully so that the power required does not exceed
the motor's rating. The power input required by any pump can be obtained from the pump
characteristic curve for the unit being considered. Such curves are available free of charge
from the pump manufacturer.
The pump operating point is at the intersection of the pump characteristic curve and
the system-head curve in conformance with the first law of thermodynamics, which states
that the energy put into the system must exactly match the energy used by the system. The
intersection of the pump characteristic curve and the system-head curve is the only point
that fulfills this basic law.
There is no practical limit for pumps in parallel. Careful analysis of the system-head
curve versus the pump characteristic curves provided by the pump manufacturer will fre-
quently reveal cases where the system load point may be beyond the desired pump curve.
The first cost of two or three smaller pumps is frequently no greater than for one large
pump. Hence, smaller pumps in parallel may be more desirable than a single large pump,
from both the economic and reliability standpoints.
One frequently overlooked design consideration in piping for pumps is shown in Fig.
20. This is the location of the check valve to prevent reverse-flow pumping. Figure 20
shows the proper location for this simple valve.

5. Compute the energy saving possible

Since one pump can carry the fluid flow load about 90 percent of the time, and this same
percentage holds for the design conditions, the saving in energy is 0.9 x (0.5 kW - .25 kW)
• x 90 h per week = 20.25 kWh/week. (In this computation we used the assumption that 1 hp
= 1 kW.) The annual savings would be 52 weeks x 20.25 kW/week = 1053 kWh/yr. If elec-
tricity costs 5 cents per kWh, the annual saving is $0.05 x 1053 = $52.65/yr.
While a saving of some $51 per year may seem small, such a saving can become much

more if: (1) larger pumps using higher horsepower (kW) motors are used; (2) several hun-
dred pumps are used in the system; (3) the operating time is longer—168 hours per week
in some systems. If any, or all, these conditions prevail, the savings can be substantial.
Related Calculations. This procedure can be used for pumps in a variety of
applications: industrial, commercial, residential, medical, recreational, and similar sys-
tems. When analyzing any system the designer should be careful to consider all the avail-
able options so the best one is found.

SIMILARITY OR AFFINITY LAWS
FOR CENTRIFUGAL PUMPS

A centrifugal pump designed for a 1800-r/min operation and a head of 200 ft (60.9 m) has
a capacity of 3000 gal/min (189.3 L/s) with a power input of 175 hp (130.6 kW). What ef-
fect will a speed reduction to 1200 r/min have on the head, capacity, and power input of
the pump? What will be the change in these variables if the impeller diameter is reduced
from 12 to 10 in (304.8 to 254 mm) while the speed is held constant at 1800 r/min?

Calculation Procedure:
1. Compute the effect of a change in pump speed

For any centrifugal pump in which the effects of fluid viscosity are negligible, or are neg-
lected, the similarity or affinity laws can be used to determine the effect of a speed, pow-
er, or head change. For a constant impeller diameter, the laws are QiIQ2
 = N1SN2; H1IH2 =
(N1IN2)2; P1IP2 = (N1SN2)3. For a constant speed, Q1IQ2 = D1ID2; H1IH2 = (D1ID2)2; P1IP2
= (DiID2)3. In both sets of laws, Q = capacity, gal/min; TV= impeller rpm; D = impeller di-
ameter, in; H = total head, ft of liquid; P = bhp input. The subscripts 1 and 2 refer to the
initial and changed conditions, respectively.
For this pump, with a constant impeller diameter, QiIQ2 = NiIN2; 3000/g2
1800/1200; Q2 = 2000 gal/min (126.2 L/s). And, H1IH2 = (N1IN2)2 = 200/#2 =
(1800/1200)2; H2 = 88.9 ft (27.1 m). Also, P1IP2 = (N1IN2)3 = 115IP2 = (1800/1200)3;
P2 = 51.8 bhp (38.6 kW).

 =

2. Compute the effect of a change in impeller diameter

With the speed constant, use the second set of laws. Or, for this pump, QiIQ2 = D1ID2;
3000/e2 = 12Ao; Q2 = 2500 gal/min (157.7 L/s). And AT1^2 = (DiID2)2; 2OQIH2 = (12A0)2;
H2 = 138.8 ft (42.3 m). Also, P1IP2 = (D1ID2)3; 115IP2 = (12Ao)3; P2 = 101.2 bhp (75.5 kW).
Related Calculations. Use the similarity laws to extend or change the data obtained
from centrifugal pump characteristic curves. These laws are also useful in field calcula-
tions when the pump head, capacity, speed, or impeller diameter is changed.
The similarity laws are most accurate when the efficiency of the pump remains nearly
constant. Results obtained when the laws are applied to a pump having a constant im-
peller diameter are somewhat more accurate than for a pump at constant speed with a
changed impeller diameter. The latter laws are more accurate when applied to pumps hav-
ing a low specific speed.
If the similarity laws are applied to a pump whose impeller diameter is increased, be cer-
tain to consider the effect of the higher velocity in the pump suction line. Use the similari-
ty laws for any liquid whose viscosity remains constant during passage through the pump.
However, the accuracy of the similarity laws decreases as the liquid viscosity increases.

SIMILARITY OR AFFINITY LAWS IN
CENTRIFUGAL PUMP SELECTION

A test-model pump delivers, at its best efficiency point, 500 gal/min (31.6 L/s) at a 350-ft
(106.7-m) head with a required net positive suction head (NPSH) of 10 ft (3 m) a power
input of 55 hp (41 kW) at 3500 r/min, when a 10.5-in (266.7-mm) diameter impeller is
used. Determine the performance of the model at 1750 r/min. What is the performance of
a full-scale prototype pump with a 20-in (50.4-cm) impeller operating at 1170 r/min?
What are the specific speeds and the suction specific speeds of the test-model and proto-
type pumps?

Calculation Procedure:
1. Compute the pump performance at the new speed

The similarity or affinity laws can be stated in general terms, with subscripts p and m for
prototype and model, respectively, as Qp = K$NnQm; Hp = KjK%Hm; NPSH^ =
A^2NPSH7n; Pp = K%K5
nPm, where Kd = size factor = prototype dimension/model dimen-
sion. The usual dimension used for the size factor is the impeller diameter. Both dimensions
should be in the same units of measure. Also, Kn = (prototype speed, r/min)/(model speed,
r/min). Other symbols are the same as in the previous calculation procedure.
When the model speed is reduced from 3500 to 1750 r/min, the pump dimensions re-
mains the same and Kd = 1.0; Kn = 1750/3500 - 0.5. Then Q = (1.0)(0.5)(500) = 250
r/min; H= (1.0)2(0.5)2(350) = 87.5 ft (26.7 m); NPSH = (1.0)2(0.5)2(10) = 2.5 ft (0.76 m);
P = (1.0)5(0.5)3(55) = 6.9 hp (5.2 kW). In this computation, the subscripts were omitted
from the equations because the same pump, the test model, was being considered.

2. Compute performance of the prototype pump

First, Kd and Kn must be found: Kd = 20/10.5 = 1.905; Kn = 1170/3500 = 0.335. Then Qp =
(1.905)3(0.335)(500) = 1158 gal/min (73.1 L/s); Hp = (1.905)2(0.335)2(350) = 142.5 ft
(43.4 m); NPSH^ = (1.905)2(0.335)2(10) = 4.06 ft (1.24 m); Pp = (1.905)5(0.335)3(55) =
51 .8hp (38 .6kW ).

3. Compute the specific speed and suction specific speed

The specific speed or, as Horwitz1 says, "more correctly, discharge specific speed," is TV5
= #(fi)°-5/(#)°-75, while the suction specific speed S = N(Q)0-V(NPSH)0-75, where all val-
ues are taken at the best efficiency point of the pump.
For the model, N3 = 3500(500)°-5/(350)°-75 = 965; S = 3500(500) °-V(IO)0-75 = 13,900.
For the prototype, N3 = 1170(1158)05/(142.5)°-75 = 965; S = 1170(1156)°-5/(4.06)075 =
13,900. The specific speed and suction specific speed of the model and prototype are
equal because these units are geometrically similar or homologous pumps and both
speeds are mathematically derived from the similarity laws.
Related Calculations. Use the procedure given here for any type of centrifu-
gal pump where the similarity laws apply. When the term model is used, it can apply to a
production test pump or to a standard unit ready for installation. The procedure presented
here is the work of R. P. Horwitz, as reported in Power magazine.1

FIGURE 1. Upper limits of specific speeds of single-stage, single- and double-suction cen-
trifugal pumps handling clear water at 850F (29.40C) at sea level. (Hydraulic Institute.)

Calculation Procedure:
1. Determine the upper limit of specific speed

Use the Hydraulic Institute upper specific-speed curve, Fig. 1, for centrifugal pumps or a
similar curve, Fig. 2, for mixed- and axial-flow pumps. Enter Fig. 1 at the bottom at
280-ft (85.3-m) total head, and project vertically upward until the 10-ft (3-m) suction-lift
curve is intersected. From here, project horizontally to the right to read the specific speed
N3 = 2000. Figure 2 is used in a similar manner.

2. Compute the maximum pump capacity

For any centrifugal, mixed- or axial-flow pump, Ns = (gpm)°-5(rpm)/H°t-15, where H1 =
total head on the pump, ft of liquid. Solving for the maximum capacity, we get gpm =
(NsH°t-75/rpm)2 = (2000 x 280075/1750)2 = 6040 gal/min (381.1 L/s).

3. Determine the pump efficiency and impeller shape

Figure 3 shows the general relation between impeller shape, specific speed, pump
capacity, efficiency, and characteristic curves. At Ns = 2000, efficiency = 87 percent.
The impeller, as shown in Fig. 3, is moderately short and has a relatively large dis-
charge area. A cross section of the impeller appears directly under the Ns = 2000 ordi-
nate.
Related Calculations. Use the method given here for any type of pump
whose variables are included in the Hydraulic Institute curves. Figs. 1 and 2, and in sim-
ilar curves available from the same source. Operating specific speed, computed as
above, is sometimes plotted on the performance curve of a centrifugal pump so that the
characteristics of the unit can be better understood. Type specific speed is the operating

identify a pump. Specific speed is important in cavitation and suction-lift studies. The
Hydraulic Institute curves, Figs. 1 and 2, give upper limits of speed, head, capacity and
suction lift for cavitation-free operation. When making actual pump analyses, be certain
to use the curves (Figs. 1 and 2) in the latest edition of the Standards of the Hydraulic
Institute.

SELECTING THE BEST OPERATING SPEED
FOR A CENTRIFUGAL PUMP

A single-suction centrifugal pump is driven by a 60-Hz ac motor. The pump delivers
10,000 gal/min (630.9 L/s) of water at a 100-ft (30.5-m) head. The available net positive
suction head = 32 ft (9.7 m) of water. What is the best operating speed for this pump if the
pump operates at its best efficiency point?

Calculation Procedure:
1. Determine the specific speed and suction specific speed

Ac motors can operate at a variety of speeds, depending on the number of poles. Assume
that the motor driving this pump might operate at 870, 1160, 1750, or 3500 r/min. Com-
pute the specific speed Ns = N(Q)0-5/(H)0-15 = A^(10,000)°-5/(100)°-75 - 3.147V and the suc-
tion specific speed S = 7V(0°-5/(NPSH)°75 = 7V(10,000)° 5/(32) °75 = 1A3N for each of the
assumed speeds. Tabulate the results as follows:

2. Choose the best speed for the pump

Analyze the specific speed and suction specific speed at each of the various operating
speeds, using the data in Tables 1 and 2. These tables show that at 870 and 1160 r/min,
the suction specific-speed rating is poor. At 1750 r/min, the suction specific-speed rating
is excellent, and a turbine or mixed-flow type pump will be suitable. Operation at 3500
r/min is unfeasible because a suction specific speed of 26,000 is beyond the range of con-
ventional pumps.

handling water for plant services, cooling, process, fire protection, and similar require-

pump? A swing check valve is used on the pump suction line and a gate valve on the dis-
charge line.

Calculation Procedure:
1. Sketch the possible piping arrangements

Figure 4 shows the six possible piping arrangements for the stated conditions of the in-
stallation. Label the total static head, i.e., the vertical distance from the surface of the
source of the liquid supply to the free surface of the liquid in the discharge receiver, or to
the point of free discharge from the discharge pipe. When both the suction and discharge
surfaces are open to the atmosphere, the total static head equals the vertical difference in
elevation. Use the free-surface elevations that cause the maximum suction lift and dis-
charge head, i.e., the lowest possible level in the supply tank and the highest possible lev-
el in the discharge tank or pipe. When the supply source is below the pump centerline, the
vertical distance is called the static suction lift; with the supply above the pump center-
line, the vertical distance is called static suction head. With variable static suction head,
use the lowest liquid level in the supply tank when computing total static head. Label the
diagrams as shown in Fig. 4.

2. Compute the total static head on the pump

The total static head Hts ft = static suction lift, hsi ft + static discharge head hsd ft, where
the pump has a suction lift, s in Fig. 40, b, and c. In these installations, Hts= 10 + 100 =
110 ft (33.5 m). Note that the static discharge head is computed between the pump center-
line and the water level with an underwater discharge. Fig. 4a; to the pipe outlet with a
free discharge, Fig. 46; and to the maximum water level in the discharge tank, Fig. 4c.
When a pump is discharging into a closed compression tank, the total discharge head
equals the static discharge head plus the head equivalent, ft of liquid, of the internal pres-
sure in the tank, or 2.31 x tank pressure, lb/in2.
Where the pump has a static suction head, as in Fig. 4d, e, and/ the total static head
Ht3
 ft = h*d ~ static suction head hsh ft. In these installations, Ht = 100 - 15 = 85 ft
(25.9 m).
The total static head, as computed above, refers to the head on the pump without liquid
flow. To determine the total head on the pump, the friction losses in the piping system
during liquid flow must be also determined.

3. Compute the piping friction losses

Mark the length of each piece of straight pipe on the piping drawing. Thus, in Fig. Wa,
the total length of straight pipe L , ft = 8 + 10 + 5 + 102 + 5 = 130 ft (39.6 m), if we start at
the suction tank and add each length until the discharge tank is reached. To the total
length of straight pipe must be added the equivalent length of the pipe fittings. In Fig. 1Oa
there are four long-radius elbows, one swing check valve, and one globe valve. In addi-
tion, there is a minor head loss at the pipe inlet and at the pipe outlet.
The equivalent length of one 8-in (203.2-mm) long-radius elbow is 14 ft (4.3 m) of
pipe, from Table 3. Since the pipe contains four elbows, the total equivalent length =
4(14) = 56 ft (17.1 m) of straight pipe. The open gate valve has an equivalent resistance of
4.5 ft (1.4 m); and the open swing check valve has an equivalent resistance of 53 ft
(16.2m).
The entrance loss he ft, assuming a basket-type strainer is used at the suction-pipe in-
let, is he ft = Kv2/2g, where K = a constant from Fig. 5',V = liquid velocity, ft/s; g = 32.2
ft/s2 (980.67 cm/s2). The exit loss occurs when the liquid passes through a sudden en-
largement, as from a pipe to a tank. Where the area of the tank is large, causing a final ve-
locity that is zero, hex - v2/2g.

FIGURE 5. Resistance coefficients of pipe fittings. To convert to SI in the equation for h, v2
would be measured in m/s and feet would be changed to meters. The following values would
also be changed from inches to millimeters: 0.3 to 7.6, 0.5 to 12.7, 1 to 25.4, 2 to 50.8, 4 to
101.6, 6 to 152.4, 10 to 254, and 20 to 508. (Hydraulic Institute.)

The velocity v ft/s in a pipe = g/?m/2.448t/2. For this pipe, v = 2000/[(2.448)(7.98)2)] =
12.82 ft/s (3.91 m/s). Then he = 0.74(12.82)2/[2(23.2)] = 1.89 ft (0.58 m), and hex =
(12.82)2/[(2)(32.2)] = 2.56 ft (0.78 m). Hence, the total length of the piping system in Fig.
4a is 130 + 56 + 4.5 + 53 + 1.89 + 2.56 = 247.95 ft (75.6 m), say 248 ft (75.6 m).
Use a suitable head-loss equation, or Table 4, to compute the head loss for the pipe
and fittings. Enter Table 4 at an 8-in (203.2-mm) pipe size, and project horizontally across
to 2000 gal/min (126.2 L/s) and read the head loss as 5.86 ft of water per 100 ft
(1 .8m /30 .5m )o fp ipe.
The total length of pipe and fittings computed above is 248 ft (75.6 m). Then total fric-
tion-head loss with a 2000 gal/min (126.2-L/s) flow is Hfft = (5.86)(248/100) = 14.53 ft
(4.5m).

4. Compute the total head on the pump

The total head on the pump Ht = Hts + Hf. For the pump in Fig. 4a, / / ,= 110+ 14.53 =
124.53 ft (37.95 m), say 125 ft (38.1 m). The total head on the pump in Fig. 4b and c
would be the same. Some engineers term the total head on a pump the total dynamic head
to distinguish between static head (no-flow vertical head) and operating head (rated flow
through the pump).
The total head on the pumps in Fig. 4d, C9 and/is computed in the same way as de-
scribed above, except that the total static head is less because the pump has a static suc-
tion head. That is, the elevation of the liquid on the suction side reduces the total distance
through which the pump must discharge liquid; thus the total static head is less. The static
suction head is subtracted from the static discharge head to determine the total static head
on the pump.

5. Compute the horsepower required to drive the pump

The brake hp input to a pump bhpt = (gpm)(Ht)(s)/3960e, where s = specific gravity of the
liquid handled; e = hydraulic efficiency of the pump, expressed as a decimal. The usual
hydraulic efficiency of a centrifugal pump is 60 to 80 percent; reciprocating pumps, 55 to
90 percent; rotary pumps, 50 to 90 percent. For each class of pump, the hydraulic effi-
ciency decreases as the liquid viscosity increases.
Assume that the hydraulic efficiency of the pump in this system is 70 percent and the

specific gravity of the liquid handled is 1.0. Then bhPi = (2000)(127)(1.0)/(3960)(0.70) =
91 .6hp(68 .4kW).
The theoretical or hydraulic horsepower hph = (gpm)(Ht)(s)/396Q, or hph = (2000) =
(127)(1.0)73900 = 64.1 hp (47.8 kW).
Related Calculations. Use this procedure for any liquid—water, oil, chemical,
sludge, etc.—whose specific gravity is known. When liquids other than water are being
pumped, the specific gravity and viscosity of the liquid, as discussed in later calculation
procedures, must be taken into consideration. The procedure given here can be used for
any class of pump—centrifugal, rotary, or reciprocating.
Note that Fig. 5 can be used to determine the equivalent length of a variety of pipe fit-
tings. To use Fig. 5, simply substitute the appropriate K value in the relation h = Kv2/2g,
where h = equivalent length of straight pipe; other symbols as before.

PUMP SELECTION FOR ANY
PUMPING SYSTEM

Give a step-by-step procedure for choosing the class, type, capacity, drive, and materials
for a pump that will be used in an industrial pumping system.

Calculation Procedure:
1. Sketch the proposed piping layout

Use a single-line diagram, Fig. 6, of the piping system. Base the sketch on the actual job
conditions. Show all the piping, fittings, valves, equipment, and other units in the system.
Mark the actual and equivalent pipe length (see the previous calculation procedure) on
the sketch. Be certain to include all vertical lifts, sharp bends, sudden enlargements, stor-
age tanks, and similar equipment in the proposed system.

2. Determine the required capacity of the pump

The required capacity is the flow rate that must be handled in gal/min, million gal/day,
ft3/s, gal/h, bbl/day, Ib/h, acre-ft/day, mil/h, or some similar measure. Obtain the required
flow rate from the process conditions, for example, boiler feed rate, cooling-water flow
rate, chemical feed rate, etc. The required flow rate for any process unit is usually given
by the manufacturer or can be computed by using the calculation procedures given
throughout this handbook.
Once the required flow rate is determined, apply a suitable factor of safety. The value
of this factor of safety can vary from a low of 5 percent of the required flow to a high of
50 percent or more, depending on the application. Typical safety factors are in the 10 per-
cent range. With flow rates up to 1000 gal/min (63.1 L/s), and in the selection of process
pumps, it is common practice to round a computed required flow rate to the next highest
round-number capacity. Thus, with a required flow rate of 450 gal/min (28.4 L/s) and a
10 percent safety factor, the flow of 450 + 0.10(450) = 495 gal/min (31.2 L/s) would be
rounded to 500 gal/min (31.6 L/s) before the pump was selected. A pump of 500-gal/min
(31.6-L/s), or larger, capacity would be selected.

3. Compute the total head on the pump

Use the steps given in the previous calculation procedure to compute the total head on the
pump. Express the result in ft (m) of water—this is the most common way of expressing
the head on a pump. Be certain to use the exact specific gravity of the liquid handled

when expressing the head in ft (m) of water. A specific gravity less than 1.00 reduces the
total head when expressed in ft (m) of water; whereas a specific gravity greater than 1.00
increases the total head when expressed in ft (m) of water. Note that variations in the suc-
tion and discharge conditions can affect the total head on the pump.

4. Analyze the liquid conditions

Obtain complete data on the liquid pumped. These data should include the name and
chemical formula of the liquid, maximum and minimum pumping temperature, corre-
sponding vapor pressure at these temperatures, specific gravity, viscosity at the pumping
temperature, pH, flash point, ignition temperature, unusual characteristics (such as ten-
dency to foam, curd, crystallize, become gelatinous or tacky), solids content, type of
solids and their size, and variation in the chemical analysis of the liquid.
Enter the liquid conditions on a pump selection form like that in Fig. 7. Such forms are
available from many pump manufacturers or can be prepared to meet special job condi-
tions.

Summary of Essential Data Required in Selection of Centrifugal Pumps

5. Select the class and type of pump

Three classes of pumps are used today—centrifugal, rotary, and reciprocating, Fig. 8.
Note that these terms apply only to the mechanics of moving the liquid—not to the serv-
ice for which the pump was designed. Each class of pump is further subdivided into a
number of types, Fig. 8.
Use Table 5 as a general guide to the class and type of pump to be used. For example,
when a large capacity at moderate pressure is required, Table 5 shows that a centrifugal

pump would probably be best. Table 5 also shows the typical characteristics of various
classes and types of pumps used in industrial process work.
Consider the liquid properties when choosing the class and type of pump, because ex-
ceptionally severe conditions may rule out one or another class of pump at the start. Thus,
screw- and gear-type rotary pumps are suitable for handling viscous, nonabrasive liquid,
Table 5. When an abrasive liquid must be handled, either another class of pump or anoth-
er type of rotary pump must be used.
Also consider all the operating factors related to the particular pump. These factors in-
clude the type of service (continuous or intermittent), operating-speed preferences, future
load expected and its effect on pump head and capacity, maintenance facilities available,
possibility of parallel or series hookup, and other conditions peculiar to a given job.
Once the class and type of pump is selected, consult a rating table (Table 6) or rating
chart, Fig. 9, to determine whether a suitable pump is available from the manufacturer
whose unit will be used. When the hydraulic requirements fall between two standard
pump models, it is usual practice to choose the next larger size of pump, unless there is
some reason why an exact head and capacity are required for the unit. When one manu-
facturer does not have the desired unit, refer to the engineering data of other manufactur-
ers. Also keep in mind that some pumps are custom-built for a given job when precise
head and capacity requirements must be met.
Other pump data included in manufacturer's engineering information include charac-
teristic curves for various diameter impellers in the same casing. Fig. 10, and variable-
speed head-capacity curves for an impeller of given diameter, Fig. 11. Note that the re-
quired power input is given in Figs. 9 and 10 and may also be given in Fig. 11. Use of
Table 6 is explained in the table.
Performance of data for rotary pumps are given in several forms. Figure 12 shows a
typical plot of the head and capacity ranges of different types of rotary pumps. Recipro-
cating-pump capacity data are often tabulated, as in Table 7.

6. Evaluate the pump chosen for the installation

Check the specific speed of a centrifugal pump, using the method given in an earlier cal-
culation procedure. Once the specific speed is known, the impeller type and approximate
operating efficiency can be found from Fig. 3.
Check the piping system, using the method of an earlier calculation procedure, to see
whether the available net positive suction head equals, or is greater than, the required net
positive suction head of the pump.
Determine whether a vertical or horizontal pump is more desirable. From the stand-
point of floor space occupied, required NPSH, priming, and flexibility in changing the
pump use, vertical pumps may be preferable to horizontal designs in some installations.
But where headroom, corrosion, abrasion, and ease of maintenance are important factors,
horizontal pumps may be preferable.
As a general guide, single-suction centrifugal pumps handle up to 50 gal/min (3.2 L/s)
at total heads up to 50 ft (15.2 m); either single- or double-suction pumps are used for the
flow rates to 1000 gal/min (63.1 L/s) and total heads to 300 ft (91.4 m); beyond these ca-
pacities and heads, double-suction or multistage pumps are generally used.
Mechanical seals are becoming more popular for all types of centrifugal pumps in a
variety of services. Although they are more costly than packing, the mechanical seal re-
duces pump maintenance costs.

ANALYSIS OF PUMP AND SYSTEM
CHARACTERISTIC CURVES

Analyze a set of pump and system characteristic curves for the following conditions: fric-
tion losses without static head; friction losses with static head; pump without lift; system
with little friction; much static head; system with gravity head; system with different pipe
sizes; system with two discharge heads; system with diverted flow; and effect of pump
wear on characteristic curve.

Calculation Procedure:
1. Plot the system-friction curve

Without static head, the system-friction curve passes through the origin (0,0), Fig. 13, be-
cause when no head is developed by the pump, flow through the piping is zero. For most
piping systems, the friction-head loss varies as the square of the liquid flow rate in the
system. Hence, a system-friction curve, also called a friction-head curve, is parabolic—
the friction head increases as the flow rate or capacity of the system increases. Draw the
curve as shown in Fig. 13.

2. Plot the piping system and system-head curve

Figure 14a shows a typical piping system with a pump operating against a static discharge
head. Indicate the total static head, Fig. 146, by a dashed line—in this installation Hts =
110 ft. Since static head is a physical dimension, it does not vary with flow rate and is a
constant for all flow rates. Draw the dashed line parallel to the abscissa, Fig. b.
From the point of no flow—zero capacity—plot the friction-head loss at various flow
rates—100, 200, 300 gal/min (6.3, 12.6, 18.9 L/s), etc. Determine the friction-head loss
by computing it as shown in an earlier calculation procedure. Draw a curve through the
points obtained. This is called the system-head curve.
Plot the pump head-capacity (H-Q) curve of the pump on Fig. b. The H-Q curve can
be obtained from the pump manufacturer or from a tabulation of H and Q values for the
pump being considered. The point of intersection A between the H-Q and system-head
curves is the operating point of the pump.
Changing the resistance of a given piping system by partially closing a valve or mak-
ing some other change in the friction alters the position of the system-head curve and
pump operating point. Compute the frictional resistance as before, and plot the artificial
system-head curve as shown. Where this curve intersects the H-Q curve is the new oper-
ating point of the pump. System-head curves are valuable for analyzing the suitability of a
given pump for a particular application.

3. Plot the no-lift system-head curve and compute the losses

With no static head or lift, the system-head curve passes through the origin (0,0), Fig. 15.
For a flow of 900 gal/min (56.8 L/s) in this system, compute the friction loss as follows,
using the Hydraulic Institute Pipe Friction Manual tables or the method of earlier calcula-
tion procedures:

Entrance loss from tank into 10-in (254-mm) suction pipe, Q.5v2/2g 
Friction loss in 2 ft (0.61 m) of suction pipe 
Loss in 10-in (254-mm) 90° elbow at pump

FIGURE 15. No lift; all friction head. (Peerless Pumps.)

Compute the friction loss at other flow rates in a similar manner, and plot the system-
head curve, Fig. 15. Note that if all losses in this system except the friction in the dis-
charge pipe were ignored, the total head would not change appreciably. However, for the
purposes of accuracy, all losses should always be computed.

4. Plot the low-friction, high-head system-head curve

The system-head curve for the vertical pump installation in Fig. 16 starts at the total static
head, 15 ft (4.6 m), and zero flow. Compute the friction head for 15,000 gal/min as follows:

Friction in 20 ft (6.1 m) of 24-in (609.6-mm) pipe

Hence, almost 90 percent of the total head of 15 + 2 = 17 ft (5.2 m) at 15,000-gal/min
(946.4-L/s) flow is static head. But neglect of the pipe friction and exit losses could cause
appreciable error during selection of a pump for the job.

5. Plot the gravity-head system-head curve

In a system with gravity head (also called negative lift), fluid flow will continue until the
system friction loss equals the available gravity head. In Fig. 17 the available gravity head

is 50 ft (15.2 m). Flows up to 7200 gal/min (454.3 L/s) are obtained by gravity head
alone. To obtain larger flow rates, a pump is needed to overcome the friction in the piping
between the tanks. Compute the friction loss for several flow rates as follows:

At 5000 gal/min (315.5 L/s) friction loss in 1000 ft (305 m) 
of 16-in (406.4-mm) pipe

Using these three flow rates, plot the system-head curve, Fig. 17.

6. Plot the system-head curves for different pipe sizes

When different diameter pipes are used, the friction loss vs. flow rate is plotted independ-
ently for the two pipe sizes. At a given flow rate, the total friction loss for the system is
the sum of the loss for the two pipes. Thus, the combined system-head curve represents
the sum of the static head and the friction losses for all portions of the pipe.

7. Plot the system-head curve for two discharge heads

Figure 19 shows a typical pumping system having two different discharge heads. Plot
separate system-head curves when the discharge heads are different. Add the flow rates
for the two pipes at the same head to find points on the combined system-head curve, Fig.
19. Thus,

1700 gal/min (107.3 L/s). To produce a flow of 1700 gal/min (107.3 L/s) through this sys-
tem, a pump capable of developing an 88-ft (26.8-m) head is required.

8. Plot the system-head curve for diverted flow

To analyze a system with diverted flow, assume that a constant quantity of liquid is
tapped off at the intermediate point. Plot the friction loss vs. flow rate in the normal
manner for pipe 1, Fig. 20. Move the curve for pipe 3 to the right at zero head by an
amount equal to Q2, since this represents the quantity passing through pipes 1 and 2 but

9. Plot the effect of pump wear

When a pump wears, there is a loss in capacity and efficiency. The amount of loss de-
pends, however, on the shape of the system-head curve. For a centrifugal pump, Fig. 21,
the capacity loss is greater for a given amount of wear if the system-head curve is flat, as
compared with a steep system-head curve.
Determine the capacity loss for a worn pump by plotting its H-Q curve. Find this
curve by testing the pump at different capacities and plotting the corresponding head. On
the same chart, plot the H-Q curve for a new pump of the same size, Fig. 21. Plot the sys-
tem-head curve, and determine the capacity loss as shown in Fig. 21.

Related Calculations. Use the techniques given here for any type of pump—

neering, and Peerless Pump Division of FMC Corp.

NET POSITIVE SUCTION HEAD
FOR HOT-LIQUID PUMPS

What is the maximum capacity of a double-suction pump operating at 1750 r/min if it
handles 10O0F (37.80C) water from a hot well having an absolute pressure of 2.0 in (50.8
mm) Hg if the pump centerline is 10 ft (30.5 m) below the hot-well liquid level and the
friction-head loss in the suction piping and fitting is 5 ft (1.52 m) of water?

Calculation Procedure:
1. Compute the net positive suction head on the pump

The net positive suction head hn on a pump when the liquid supply is above the pump in-
let = pressure on liquid surface + static suction head - friction-head loss in suction piping
and pump inlet - vapor pressure of the liquid, all expressed in ft absolute of liquid han-
dled. When the liquid supply is below the pump centerline—i.e., there is a static suction
lift —the vertical distance of the lift is subtracted from the pressure on the liquid surface
instead of added as in the above relation.
The density of 10O0F (37.80C) water is 62.0 lb/ft3 (992.6 kg/m3), computed as shown
in earlier calculation procedures in this handbook. The pressure on the liquid surface, in
absolute ft of liquid = (2.0 in Hg)(1.133)(62.4/62.0) = 2.24 ft (0.68 m). In this calculation,
1.133 - ft of 39.20F (40C) water = 1 in Hg; 62.4 = lb/ft3 (999.0 kg/m3) of 39.20F (40C)
water. The temperature of 39.20F (40C) is used because at this temperature water has its
maximum density. Thus, to convert in Hg to ft absolute of water, find the product of (in
Hg)(Ll 33)(water density at 39.2°F)/(water density at operating temperature). Express
both density values in the same unit, usually lb/ft3.
The static suction head is a physical dimension that is measured in ft (m) of liquid at
the operating temperature. In this installation, hsh= 10 ft (3 m) absolute.
The friction-head loss is 5 ft (1.52 m) of water. When it is computed by using the
methods of earlier calculation procedures, this head loss is in ft (m) of water at maximum
density. To convert to ft absolute, multiply by the ratio of water densities at 39.20F (40C)
and the operating temperature, or (5)(62.4/62.0) = 5.03 ft (1.53 m).
The vapor pressure of water at 10O0F (37.80C) is 0.949 lb/in2 (abs) (6.5 kPa) from the
steam tables). Convert any vapor pressure to ft absolute by finding the result of [vapor
pressure, 
lb/in2 (abs)] (144 
in2/ft2)/liquid density at operating temperature, or
(0.949)(144)/62.0 = 2.204 ft (0.67 m) absolute.
With all the heads known, the net positive suction head is hn = 2.24 + 10 - 5.03 -
2.204 - 5.01 ft (1.53 m) absolute.

2. Determine the capacity of the pump

Use the Hydraulic Institute curve, Fig. 22, to determine the maximum capacity of the
pump. Enter at the left of Fig. 22 at a net positive suction head of 5.01 ft (1.53 m), and
project horizontally to the right until the 3500-r/min curve is intersected. At the top, read
the capacity as 278 gal/min (17.5 L/s).

Related Calculations. Use this procedure for any pump handling water at an
elevated temperature. Consult the Standards of the Hydraulic Institute for capacity curves
of pumps having different types of construction. In general, pump manufacturers who are
members of the Hydraulic Institute rate their pumps in accordance with the Standards,
and a pump chosen from a catalog capacity table or curve will deliver the stated capacity.
A similar procedure is used for computing the capacity of pumps handling volatile petro-
leum liquids. When you use this procedure, be certain to refer to the latest edition of the
Standards.

PART 3

CENTRIFUGALPUMPS
AND HYDRO POWER

MINIMUM SAFE FLOW FOR A
CENTRIFUGAL PUMP

A centrifugal pump handles 22O0F (104.40C) water and has a shutoff head (with closed
discharge valve) of 3200 ft (975.4 m). At shutoff, the pump efficiency is 17 percent and
the input brake horsepower is 210 (156.7 kW). What is the minimum safe flow through
this pump to prevent overheating at shutoff? Determine the minimum safe flow if the
NPSH is 18.8 ft (5.7 m) of water and the liquid specific gravity is 0.995. If the pump con-
tains 500 Ib (225 kg) of water, determine the rate of the temperature rise at shutoff.

Calculation Procedure:
1. Compute the temperature rise in the pump

With the discharge valve closed, the power input to the pump is converted to heat in the cas-
ing and causes the liquid temperature to rise. The temperature rise t = (I - e) x H8IIlSe,
where t = temperature rise during shutoff, 0F; e = pump efficiency, expressed as a decimal;
H3 = shutoff head, ft. For this pump, t = (1 - 0.17)(3200)/[7780(0.17)] = 20.40F (36.70C).

2. Compute the minimum safe liquid flow

For general-service pumps, the minimum safe flow M gal/min = 6.0(bhp input at shut-
off)/*. Or, M= 6.0(210)720.4 = 62.7 gal/min (3.96 L/s). This equation includes a 20 per-
cent safety factor.
Centrifugal pumps usually have a maximum allowable temperature rise of 150F
(270C). The minimum allowable flow through the pump to prevent the water temperature
from rising more than 150F (270C) is 30 gal/min (1.89 L/s) for each 110-bhp (74.6-kW)
input at shutoff.

3. Compute the temperature rise for the operating NPSH

An NPSH of 18.8 ft (5.73 m) is equivalent to a pressure of 18.8(0.433)(0.995) = 7.78
lb/in2 (abs) (53.6 kPa) at 22O0F (104.40C), where the factor 0.433 converts ft of water to
lb/in2. At 22O0F (104.40C), the vapor pressure of the water is 17.19 lb/in2 (abs) (118.5
kPa), from the steam tables. Thus, the total vapor pressure the water can develop before
flashing occurs = NPSH pressure + vapor pressure at operating temperature = 7.78 +
17.19 = 24.97 lb/in2 (abs) (172.1 kPa). Enter the steam tables at this pressure, and read the
corresponding temperature as 24O0F (115.60C). The allowable temperature rise of the wa-
ter is then 240 - 220 = 2O0F (36.O0C). Using the safe-flow relation of step 2, we find the
minimum safe flow is 62.9 gal/min (3.97 L/s).

4. Compute the rate of temperature rise

In any centrifugal pump, the rate of temperature rise tr °F/min = 42.4(bhp input at shut-
off)/wc, where w = weight of liquid in the pump, Ib; c = specific heat of the liquid in the
pump, Btu/(lb-°F). For this pump containing 500 Ib (225 kg) of water with a specific heat,
c = 1.0, tr = 42.4(210)/[500(1.0)] = 17.8°F/min (32°C/min). This is a very rapid tempera-
ture rise and could lead to overheating in a few minutes.

Related Calculations. Use this procedure for any centrifugal pump handling
any liquid in any service—power, process, marine, industrial, or commercial. Pump man-
ufacturers can supply a temperature-rise curve for a given model pump if it is requested.
This curve is superimposed on the pump characteristic curve and shows the temperature
rise accompanying a specific flow through the pump.

SELECTING A CENTRIFUGAL PUMP
TO HANDLE A VISCOUS LIQUID

Select a centrifugal pump to deliver 750 gal/min (47.3 L/s) of 1000-SSU oil at a total
head of 100 ft (30.5 m). The oil has a specific gravity of 0.90 at the pumping temperature.
Show how to plot the characteristic curves when the pump is handling the viscous liquid.

Calculation Procedure:
1. Determine the required correction factors

A centrifugal pump handling a viscous liquid usually must develop a greater capacity and
head, and it requires a larger power input than the same pump handling water. With the
water performance of the pump known—from either the pump characteristic curves or a
tabulation of pump performance parameters—Fig. 1, prepared by the Hydraulic Institute,
can be used to find suitable correction factors. Use this chart only within its scale limits;
do not extrapolate. Do not use the chart for mixed-flow or axial-flow pumps or for pumps
of special design. Use the chart only for pumps handling uniform liquids; slurries, gels,
paper stock, etc., may cause incorrect results. In using the chart, the available net positive
suction head is assumed adequate for the pump.
To use Fig. 1, enter at the bottom at the required capacity, 750 gal/min (47.3 L/s), and
project vertically to intersect the 100-ft (30.5-m) head curve, the required head. From here
project horizontally to the 1000-SSU viscosity curve, and then vertically upward to the
correction-factor curves. Read CE = 0.635; CQ = 0.95; Cn = 0.92 for 1.Og^. The sub-
scripts E, Q, and / /refer to correction factors for efficiency, capacity, and head, respec-
tively; and NW refers to the water capacity at a particular efficiency. At maximum effi-
ciency, the water capacity is given as LOQwyi other efficiencies, expressed by numbers
equal to or less than unity, give different capacities.

2. Compute the water characteristics required

The water capacity required for the pump Qw = QVICQ where Qv = viscous capacity,
gal/min. For this pump, Qw = 750/0.95 = 790 gal/min (49.8 L/s). Likewise, water head Hw
= HV/CH, where Hv = viscous head. Or, Hw = 100/0.92 = 108.8 (33.2 m), say 109 ft
(33.2m) of water.
Choose a pump to deliver 790 gal/min (49.8 L/s) of water at 109-ft (33.2-m) head of
water, and the required viscous head and capacity will be obtained. Pick the pump so that
it is operating at or near its maximum efficiency on water. If the water efficiency Ew = 81
percent at 790 gal/min (49.8 L/s) for this pump, the efficiency when handling the viscous
liquid Ev = EWCE. Or, Ev = 0.81(0.635) - 0.515, or 51.5 percent.
The power input to the pump when handling viscous liquids is given by Pv =
2^5/3960^, where s = specific gravity of the viscous liquid. For this pump, Pv = (750)
x (100)(0.90)/[3960(0.515)] = 33.1 hp (24.7 kW).

tain to consult the latest edition of the Hydraulic Institute Standards.

Calculation Procedure:

1. Determine the deflection of the pump shaft

Use Fig. 3 to determine the shaft deflection. Note that this chart is valid for only one
pump or series of pumps and must be obtained from the pump builder. Such a chart is dif-
ficult to prepare from test data without extensive test facilities.
Enter Fig. 3 at the left at the total combined weight of the impellers, 23 Ib (10.4 kg),
and project horizontally to the right until the weight-deflection curve is intersected. From
the intersection, project vertically downward to read the shaft deflection as 0.009 in (0.23
mm) at full speed.

2. Determine the critical speed of the pump

From the intersection of the weight-deflection curve in Fig. 3 project vertically upward to
the critical-speed curve. Project horizontally right from this intersection and read the first
critical speed as 6200 r/min.
Related Calculations. Use this procedure for any class of pump—centrifugal, ro-
tary, or reciprocating—for which the shaft-deflection and critical-speed curves are avail-
able. These pumps can be used for any purpose—process, power, marine, industrial, or
commercial.

effect does increased viscosity have on the performance of the pump?

Calculation Procedure:
1. Plot the water characteristics of the pump

Obtain a tabulation or plot of the water characteristics of the pump from the manufacturer
or from their engineering data. With a tabulation of the characteristics, enter the various
capacity and power points given, and draw a smooth curve through them, Fig. 4.

2. Plot the viscous-liquid characteristics of the pump

The viscous-liquid characteristics of regenerative-type pumps are obtained by test of the
actual unit. Hence, the only source of this information is the pump manufacturer. Obtain
these characteristics from the pump manufacturer or their test data, and plot them on Fig.
4, as shown, for each oil or other liquid handled.

3. Evaluate the effect of viscosity on pump performance

Study Fig. 4 to determine the effect of increased liquid viscosity on the performance of
the pump. Thus at a given head, say 100 ft (30.5 m), the capacity of the pump decreases as
the liquid viscosity increases. At 100-ft (30.5-m) head, this pump has a water capacity of
43.5 gal/min (2.74 L/s), Fig. 4. The pump capacity for the various oils at 100-ft (30.5-m)
head is 36 gal/min (2.27 L/s) for 400 SSU; 32 gal/min (2.02 L/s) for 600 SSU; 28 gal/min
(1.77 L/s) for 900 SSU; and 26 gal/min (1.64 L/s) for 1000 SSU, respectively. There is a
similar reduction in capacity of the pump at the other heads plotted in Fig. 4. Thus, as a
general rule, the capacity of a regenerative pump decreases with an increase in liquid vis-
cosity at constant head. Or conversely, at constant capacity, the head developed decreases
as the liquid viscosity increases.

Plots of the power input to this pump show that the input power increases as the liquid
viscosity increases.
Related Calculations. Use this procedure for a regenerative-type pump han-
dling any liquid—water, oil, kerosene, gasoline, etc. A decrease in the viscosity of a liq-
uid, as compared with the viscosity of water, will produce the opposite effect from that of
increased viscosity.

EFFECT OF LIQUID VISCOSITY ON
RECIPROCATING-PUMP PERFORMANCE

A direct-acting steam-driven reciprocating pump delivers 100 gal/min (6.31 L/s) of 7O0F
(21.10C) water when operating at 50 strokes per minute. How much 2000-SSU crude oil
will this pump deliver? How much 1250F (51.70C) water will this pump deliver?

Calculation Procedure:
1. Determine the recommended change in pump performance

Reciprocating pumps of any type—direct-acting or power—having any number of liquid-
handling cylinders—one to five or more—are usually rated for maximum delivery when
handling 250-SSU liquids or 7O0F (21.10C) water. At higher liquid viscosities or water
temperatures, the speed—strokes or rpm—is reduced. Table 1 shows typical recommend-
ed speed-correction factors for reciprocating pumps for various liquid viscosities and wa-
ter temperatures. This table shows that with a liquid viscosity of 2000 SSU the pump
speed should be reduced 20 percent. When 1250F (51.70C) water is handled, the pump
speed should be reduced 25 percent, as shown in Table 1.

2. Compute the delivery of the pump

The delivery capacity of any reciprocating pump is directly proportional to the number of
strokes per minute it makes or to its rpm.
When 2000-SSU oil is used, the pump strokes per minute must be reduced 20 percent,
or (50)(0.20) = 10 strokes/min. Hence, the pump speed will be 50 - 10 = 40 strokes/min.
Since the delivery is directly proportional to speed, the delivery of 2000-SSU oil =
(40/5O)(IOO) = 80 gal/min (5.1 L/s).
When handling 1250F (51.70C) water, the pump strokes/min must be reduced 25 per-

cent, or (50)(0.5) = 12.5 strokes/min. Hence, the pump speed will be 50.0 - 12.5 = 37.5
strokes/mm. Since the delivery is directly proportional to speed, the delivery of 1250F
(51.70C) water = (37.5/5O)(IO) - 75 gal/min (4.7 L/s).
Related Calculations. Use this procedure for any type of reciprocating pump
handling liquids falling within the range of Table 1. Such liquids include oil, kerosene,
gasoline, brine, water, etc.

EFFECT OF VISCOSITYAND DISSOLVED
GAS ON ROTARY PUMPS

A rotary pump handles 8000-SSU liquid containing 5 percent entrained gas and 10 per-
cent dissolved gas at a 20-in (508-mm) Hg pump inlet vacuum. The pump is rated at 1000
gal/min (63.1 L/s) when handling gas-free liquids at viscosities less than 600 SSU. What
is the output of this pump without slip? With 10 percent slip?

Calculation Procedure:
1. Compute the required speed reduction of the pump

When the liquid viscosity exceeds 600 SSU, many pump manufacturers recommend that
the speed of a rotary pump be reduced to permit operation without excessive noise or vi-
bration. The speed reduction usually recommended is shown in Table 2.
With this pump handling 8000-SSU liquid, a speed reduction of 40 percent is neces-
sary, as shown in Table 2. Since the capacity of a rotary pump varies directly with its
speed, the output of this pump when handling 8000-SSU liquid = (1000 gal/min) x (1.0 -
0.40) = 600 gal/min (37.9 L/s).

2. Compute the effect of gas on the pump output

Entrained or dissolved gas reduces the output or a rotary pump, as shown in Table 3. The
gas in the liquid expands when the inlet pressure of the pump is below atmospheric and
the gas occupies part of the pump chamber, reducing the liquid capacity.

For example, with 5 percent gas entrainment at 15 in Hg (381 mmHg) vacuum, the liquid displacement will be 9O1X2 percent of the pump displacement,
neglecting slip, or with 10 percent dissolved gas liquid displacement will be 9O1X2 percent of the pump displacement; and with 5 percent entrained gas combined
with 10 percent dissolved gas, the liquid displacement will be 83% percent of pump replacement.

With a 20-in (508-mm) Hg inlet vacuum, 5 percent entrained gas, and 10 percent dis-
solved gas, Table 3 shows that the liquid displacement is 74 percent of the rated displace-
ment. Thus, the output of the pump when handling this viscous, gas-containing liquid will
be (600 gal/min)(0.74) = 444 gal/min (28.0 L/s) without slip.

3. Compute the effect of slip on the pump output

Slip reduces rotary-pump output in direct proportion to the slip. Thus, with 10 percent
slip, the output of this pump = (444 gal/min)(1.0 - 0.10) = 369.6 gal/min (23.3 L/s).
Related Calculations. Use this procedure for any type of rotary pump—gear, lobe,
screw, swinging-vane, sliding-vane, or shuttle-block, handling any clear, viscous liquid.
Where the liquid is gas-free, apply only the viscosity correction. Where the liquid viscos-
ity is less than 600 SSU but the liquid contains gas or air, apply the entrained or dissolved
gas correction, or both corrections.

SELECTION OF MATERIALS
FOR PUMP PARTS

Select suitable materials for the principal parts of a pump handling cold ethylene chloride.
Use the Hydraulic Institute recommendation for materials of construction.

Calculation Procedure:
1. Determine which materials are suitable for this pump

Refer to the data section of the Hydraulic Institute Standards. This section contains a tab-
ulation of hundreds of liquids and the pump construction materials that have been suc-
cessfully used to handle each liquid.
The table shows that for cold ethylene chloride having a specific gravity of 1.28, an
all-bronze pump is satisfactory. In lieu of an all-bronze pump, the principal parts of the
pump—casing, impeller, cylinder, and shaft—can be made of one of the following mate-
rials: austenitic steels (low-carbon 18-8; 18-8/Mo; highly alloyed stainless); nickel-base
alloys containing chromium, molybdenum, and other elements, and usually less than 20
percent iron; or nickel-copper alloy (Monel metal). The order of listing in the Standards
does not necessarily indicate relative superiority, since certain factors predominating in
one instance may be sufficiently over-shadowed in others to reverse the arrangement.

2. Choose the most economical pump

Use the methods of earlier calculation procedures to select the most economical pump for
the installation. Where the corrosion resistance of two or more pumps is equal, the stan-
dard pump, in this instance an all-bronze unit, will be the most economical.
Related Calculations. Use this procedure to select the materials of construction for
any class of pump—centrifugal, rotary, or reciprocating—in any type of service—power,
process, marine, or commercial. Be certain to use the latest edition of the Hydraulic Insti-
tute Standards, because the recommended materials may change from one edition to the
next.

SIZING A HYDROPNEUMATIC
STORAGE TANK

A 200-gal/min (12.6-L/s) water pump serves a pumping system. Determine the capacity
required for a hydropneumatic tank to serve this system if the allowable high pressure in

the tank and system is 60 lb/in2 (gage) (413.6 kPa) and the allowable low pressure is 30
lb/in2 (gage) (206.8 kPa). How many starts per hour will the pump make if the system
draws 3000 gal/min (189.3 L/s) from the tank?

Calculation Procedure:
1. Compute the required tank capacity

If the usual hydropneumatic system, a storage-tank capacity in gal of 10 times the pump
capacity in gal/min is used, if this capacity produces a moderate running time for the
pump. Thus, this system would have a tank capacity of (10)(200) = 2000 gal (7570.8 L).

2. Compute the quantity of liquid withdrawn per cycle

For any hydropneumatic tank the withdrawal, expressed as the number of gallons (liters)
withdrawn per cycle, is given by W = (VL - %)/C, where V1 = air volume in tank at the
lower pressure, ft3 (m3); % = volume of air in tank at higher pressure, ft3 (m3); C = con-
version factor to convert ft3 (m3) to gallons (liters), as given below.
Compute VL and Vn using the gas law for VH and either the gas law or the reserve per-
centage for VL. Thus, for vffi the gas law gives vH=pLvL/pH, where pL = lower air pressure
in tank, lb/in2 (abs) (kPa); pH = higher air pressure in tank lb/in2 (abs) (kPa); other sym-
bols as before.
In most hydropneumatic tanks a liquid reserve of 10 to 20 percent of the total tank vol-
ume is kept in the tank to prevent the tank from running dry and damaging the pump. As-
suming a 10 percent reserve for this tank, VL = 0.1 V, where V= tank volume in ft3 (m3).
Since a 2000-gal (7570-L) tank is being used, the volume of the tank is 2000/7.481 fWgal
= 267.3 ft3 (7.6 m3). With the 10 percent reserve at the 44.7 lb/in2 (abs) (308.2-kPa) low-
er pressure, VL = 0.9 (267.3) = 240.6 ft3 (6.3 m3), where 0.9 = V- 0.1 V.
At the higher pressure in the tank, 74.7 lb/in2 (abs) (514.9 kPa), the volume of the air
will be, from the gas law, vH = pLvL/pH = 44.1 (24Q.6)114.1 = 143.9 ft3 (4.1 m3). Hence,
during withdrawal, the volume of liquid removed from the tank will be W8 = (240.6 -
143.9)70.1337 = 723.3 gal (2738 L). In this relation of the constant converts from cubic
feet to gallons and is 0.1337. To convert from cubic meters to liters, use the constant 1000
in the denominator.

3. Compute the pump running time

The pump has a capacity of 200 gal/min (12.6 L/s). Therefore, it will take 723/200 = 3.6
min to replace the withdrawn liquid. To supply 3000 gal/h (11,355 L/h) to the system, the
pump must start 3000/723 = 4.1, or 5 times per hour. This is acceptable because a system
in which the pump starts six or fewer times per hour is generally thought satisfactory.
Where the pump capacity is insufficient to supply the system demand for short peri-
ods, use a smaller reserve. Compute the running time using the equations in steps 2 and 3.
Where a larger reserve is used—say 20 percent—use the value 0.8 in the equations in step
2. For a 30 percent reserve, the value would be 0.70, and so on.
Related Calculations. Use this procedure for any liquid system having a hydropneu-
matic tank—well drinking water, marine, industrial, or process.

USING CENTRIFUGAL PUMPS
AS HYDRAULIC TURBINES

Select a centrifugal pump to serve as a hydraulic turbine power source for a 1500-gal/min
(5677.5-L/min) flow rate with 1290 ft (393.1 m) of head. The power application requires

a 3600-r/min speed, the specific gravity of the liquid is 0.52, and the total available ex-
haust head is 20 ft (6.1 m). Analyze the cavitation potential and operating characteristics
at an 80 percent flow rate.

Calculation Procedure:
1. Choose the number of stages for the pump

Search of typical centrifugal-pump data shows that a head of 1290 ft (393.1 m) is too
large for a single-stage pump of conventional design. Hence, a two-stage pump will be
the preliminary choice for this application. The two-stage pump chosen will have a design
head of 645 ft (196.6 m) per stage.

2. Compute the specific speed of the pump chosen

Use the relation Ns = pump rpm(Q)° 5///° 75, where Ns = specific speed of the pump; rpm =
r/min of pump shaft; Q = pump capacity or flow rate, gal/min; H = pump head per stage,
ft. Substituting, we get N3 = 3600(1500)° 5/(645)075 = 1090. Note that the specific speed
value is the same regardless of the system of units used—USCS or SI.

3. Convert turbine design conditions to pump design conditions

To convert from turbine design conditions to pump design conditions, use the pump
manufacturer's conversion factors that relate turbine best efficiency point (bep) per-
formance with pump bep performance. Typically, as specific speed Ns varies from 500
to 2800, these bep factors generally vary as follows: the conversion factor for capacity
(gal/min or L/min) CQ, from 2.2 to 1.1; the conversion factor for head (ft or m) C119
from 2.2 to 1.1; the conversion factor for efficiency CE9 from 0.92 to 0.99. Applying
these conversion factors to the turbine design conditions yields the pump design condi-
tions sought.
At the specific speed for this pump, the values of these conversion factors are deter-
mined from the manufacturer to be CQ = 1.24; Cn = 1.42; Q = 0.967.
Given these conversion factors, the turbine design conditions can be converted to the
pump design conditions thus: Qp = QJCQ, where Qp = pump capacity or flow rate,
gal/min or L/min; Qt = turbine capacity or flow rate in the same units; other symbols are
as given earlier. Substituting gives Qp = 1500/1.24 = 1210 gal/min (4580 L/min).
Likewise, the pump discharge head, in feet of liquid handled, is Hp = HJCH. So Hp =
645/1.42 = 454 ft (138.4m).

4. Select a suitable pump for the operating conditions

Once the pump capacity, head, and rpm are known, a pump having its best bep at these
conditions can be selected. Searching a set of pump characteristic curves and capacity ta-
bles shows that a two-stage 4-in (10-cm) unit with an efficiency of 77 percent would be
suitable.

5. Estimate the turbine horsepower developed

To predict the developed hp, convert the pump efficiency to turbine efficiency. Use the
conversion factor developed above. Or, the turbine efficiency Et = Ep CE = (0.77)(0.967)
= 0.745, or 74.5 percent.
With the turbine efficiency known, the output brake horsepower can be found from
bhp = QfHfEfS/3960, where s = fluid specific gravity; other symbols as before. Substitut-
ing, we get bhp = 1500(1290)(0.745)(0.52)/3960 = 198 hp (141 kW).

6. Determine the cavitation potential of this pump

Just as pumping requires a minimum net positive suction head, turbine duty requires a net
positive exhaust head. The relation between the total required exhaust head (TREH) and
turbine head per stage is the cavitation constant ar = TREH///. Figure 5 shows ay. vs. Ns

for hydraulic turbines. Although a pump used as a turbine will not have exactly the same
relationship, this curve provides a good estimate of crr for turbine duty.
To prevent cavitation, the total available exhaust head (TAEH) must be greater than
the TREH. In this installation, Ns = 1090 and TAEH = 20 ft (6.1 m). From Fig. 5, ar =
0.028 and TREH = 0.028(645) = 18.1 ft (5.5 m). Because TAEH > TREH, there is
enough exhaust head to prevent cavitation.

7. Determine the turbine performance at 80 percent flow rate

In many cases, pump manufacturers treat conversion factors as proprietary information.
When this occurs, the performance of the turbine under different operating conditions can
be predicted from the general curves in Figs. 6 and 7.
At the 80 percent flow rate for the turbine, or 1200 gal/min (4542 L/min), the operat-
ing point is 80 percent of bep capacity. For a specific speed of 1090, as before, the per-
centages of bep head and efficiency are shown in Figs. 6 and 7: 79.5 percent of bep head
and percent of bep efficiency. To find the actual performance, multiply by the bep values,
Or, Ht = 0.795(1290) = 1025 ft (393.1 m); Et = 0.91(74.5) = 67.8 percent.
The bhp at the new operating condition is then bhp = 1200 (1025)(0.678)(0.52)/3960 -
110hp(82 .1kW).
In a similar way, the constant-head curves in Figs. 8 and 9 predict turbine performance
at different speeds. For example, speed is 80 percent of bep speed at 2880 r/min. For a
specific speed of 1090, the percentages of bep capacity, efficiency, and power are

107 percent of the capacity, 94 percent of the efficiency, and 108 percent of the bhp. To
get the actual performance, convert as before: Qt = 107(1500) = 1 6 10 gal/min (6094
L/min); Et = 0.94(74.5) = 70.0 percent; bhp = 1.08(189) = 206 hp (153.7 kW).
Note that the bhp in this last instance is higher than the bhp at the best efficiency point.
Thus more horsepower can be obtained from a given unit by reducing the speed and in-
creasing the flow rate. When the speed is fixed, more bhp cannot be obtained from the
unit, but it may be possible to select a smaller pump for the same application.
Related Calculations. Use this general procedure for choosing a centrifugal
pump to drive—as a hydraulic turbine—another pump, a fan, a generator, or a compres-
sor, where high-pressure liquid is available as a source of power. Because pumps are de-

signed as fluid movers, they may be less efficient as hydraulic turbines than equipment
designed for that purpose. Steam turbines and electric motors are more economical when
steam or electricity is available.
But using a pump as a turbine can pay off in remote locations where steam or electric
power would require additional wiring or piping, in hazardous locations that require non-
sparking equipment, where energy may be recovered from a stream that otherwise would
be throttled, and when a radial-flow centrifugal pump is immediately available but a hy-
draulic turbine is not.
In the most common situation, there is a liquid stream with fixed head and flow rate
and an application requiring a fixed rpm; these are the turbine design conditions. The ob-
jective is to pick a pump with a turbine bep at these conditions. With performance curves
such as Fig. 4, turbine design conditions can be converted to pump design conditions.
Then you select from a manufacturer's catalog a model that has its pump bep at those val-
ues.
The most common error in pump selection is using the turbine design conditions in
choosing a pump from a catalog. Because catalog performance curves describe pump
duty, not turbine duty, the result is an oversized unit that fails to work properly.
This procedure is the work of Fred Buse, Chief Engineer, Standard Pump Aldrich Di-
vision of Ingersoll-Rand Co., as reported in Chemical Engineering magazine.

SIZING CENTRIFUGAL-PUMP IMPELLERS
FOR SAFETY SERVICE

Determine the impeller size of a centrifugal pump that will provide a safe continuous-re-
circulation flow to prevent the pump from overheating at shutoff. The pump delivers 320
gal/min (20.2 L/s) at an operating head of 450 ft (137.2 m). The inlet water temperature is
22O0F (104.40C), and the system has an NPSH of 5 ft (1.5 m). Pump performance curves
and the system-head characteristic curve for the discharge flow (without recirculation) are
shown in Fig. 5, and the piping layout is shown in Fig. 12. The brake horsepower (bhp) of
an 11-in (27.9-cm) and an 11.5-in (29.2-cm) impeller at shutoff is 53 and 60, respectively.
Determine the permissible water temperature rise for this pump.

Calculation Procedure:
1. Compute the actual temperature rise of the water in the pump

Use the relation P0 = Pv + PNPSH, where P0 = pressure corresponding to the actual liquid
temperature in the pump during operation, lb/in2 (abs) (kPa); Pv = vapor pressure in the
pump at the inlet water temperature, lb/in2 (abs) (kPa); PNPSH = pressure created by the
net positive suction head on the pumps, lb/in2 (abs) (kPa). The head in feet (meters) must
be converted to lb/in2 (abs) (kPa) by the relation lb/in2 (abs) = (NPSH, ft) (liquid density
at the pumping temperature, Ib/ft3)/(144 in2/ft2). Substituting yields P0 = 17.2 lb/in2 (abs)
+ 5(59.6)7144 = 19.3 lb/in2 (abs) (133.1 kPa).
Using the steam tables, find the saturation temperature Ts corresponding to this absolute
pressure as Ts = 226.10F (107.80C). Then the permissible temperature rise is Tp = Ts- Top,
where Top = water temperature in the pump inlet. Or, Tp = 226.1 - 220 = 6.10F (3.40C).

From the pump characteristic curve with recirculation, Fig. 13, the continuous-recircula-
tion flow QB for an 11.5-in (29.2-cm) impeller at an operating head of 450 ft (137.2 m) is

Related Calculations. Safety-service pumps are those used for standby service in a
variety of industrial plants serving the chemical, petroleum, plastics, aircraft, auto, ma-
rine, manufacturing, and similar businesses. Such pumps may be used for water supply,
fire protection, boiler feed, condenser cooling, and related tasks. In such systems the
pump is usually oversized and has a recirculation loop piped in to prevent overheating by
maintaining a minimum safe flow. Figure 11 shows a schematic of such a system. Recir-
culation is controlled by a properly sized orifice rather than by valves because an orifice
is less expensive and highly reliable.
The general procedure for sizing centrifugal pumps for safety service, using the sym-
bols given earlier, is this: (1) Select a pump that will deliver the desired flow QA, using

PLfAfP CHOICE TO REDUCE ENERGY
CONSUMPTION AND LOSS

Choose an energy-efficient pump to handle 1000 gal/min (3800 L/min) of water at 6O0F
(15.60C) at a total head of 150 ft (45.5 m). A readily commercially available pump is pre-
ferred for this application.

Calculation Procedure:
1. Compute the pump horsepower required

For any pump, bhpi = (gpm)(H^(s)l?>96Qe, where bhpt = input brake (motor) horsepower
to the pump; Ht = total head on the pump, ft; s = specific gravity of the liquid handled; e =
hydraulic efficiency of the pump. For this application where 5 = 1 .0 and a hydraulic effi-
ciency of 70 percent can be safely assumed, bhpt = (1000)(150)(1)/(3960)(0.70) = 54.1
bhp (40.3 kW).

2. Choose the most energy-efficient pump

Use Fig. 14, entering at the bottom at 1000 gal/min (3800 L/min) and projecting vertical-
ly upward to a total head of 150 ft (45.5 m). The resulting intersection is within area 1,
showing from Table 4 that a single-stage 3500-r/min electric-motor-driven pump would
be the most energy-efficiency.
Related Calculations. The procedure given here can be used for pumps in a variety
of applications—chemical, petroleum, commercial, industrial, marine, aeronautical, air-
conditioning, cooling-water, etc., where the capacity varies from 10 to 1,000,000 gal/min
(38 to 3,800,000 L/min) and the head varies from 10 to 10,000 ft (3 to 3300 m). Figure 14
is based primarily on the characteristic of pump specific speed Ns = NQ2IH314, where N =
pump rotating speed, r/min; Q = capacity, gal/min (L/min); H= total head, ft (m).
When N5 is less than 1000, the operating efficiency of single-stage centrifugal pumps
falls off dramatically; then either multistage or higher-speed pumps offer the best effi-
ciency.
Area 1 of Fig. 14 is the densest, crowded both with pumps operating at 1750 and 3500
r/min, because years ago, 3500-r/min pumps were not thought to be as durable as 1750-
r/min ones. Since the adoption of the AVS standard in 1960 (superseded by ANSI B73.1),
pumps with stiffer shafts have been proved reliable.
Also responsible for many 1750-r/min pumps in area 1 has been the impression that
the higher (3500-r/min) speed causes pumps to wear out faster. However, because im-
peller tip speed is the same at both 3500 and 1750 r/min [as, for example, a 6-in (15-cm)
impeller at 3500 r/min and a 12-in (30-cm) one at 1740 r/min], so is the fluid velocity, and
so should be the erosion of metal surface. Another reason for not limiting operating speed

is that improved impeller inlet design allows operation at 3500 r/min to capacities of 5000
gal/min (19,000 L/min) and higher.
Choice of operating speed also may be indirectly limited by specifications pertaining
to suction performance, such as that fixing the top suction specific speed S directly or
indirectly by choice of the sigma constant or by reliance on Hydraulic Institute charts.
Values of S below 8000 to 10,000 have long been accepted for avoiding cavitation.
However, since the development of the inducer, S values in the range of 20,000 to
25,000 have become commonplace, and values as high as 50,000 have become practi-
cal.
The sigma constant, which relates NPSH to total head, is little used today, and Hy-
draulic Institute charts (which are being revised) are conservative.
In light of today's designs and materials, past restrictions resulting from suction per-
formance limitations should be reevaluated or eliminated entirely.
Even if the most efficient pump has been selected, there are a number of circum-
stances in which it may not operate at peak efficiency. Today's cost of energy has made
these considerations more important.
A centrifugal pump, being a hydrodynamic machine, is designed for a single peak op-
erating-point capacity and total head. Operation at other than this best efficiency point
(bep) reduces efficiency. Specifications now should account for such factors as these:

1. A need for a larger number of smaller pumps. When a process operates over a wide
range of capacities, as many do, pumps will often work at less than full capacity,
hence at lower efficiency. This can be avoided by installing two or three pumps in par-
allel, in place of a single large one, so that one of the smaller pumps can handle the
flow when operations are at a low rate.
2. Allowance for present capacity. Pump systems are frequently designed for full flow at
some time in the future. Before this time arrives, the pumps will operate far from their
best efficiency points. Even if this interim period lasts only 2 or 3 years, it may be
more economical to install a smaller pump initially and to replace it later with a full-
capacity one.
3. Inefficient impeller size. Some specifications call for pump impeller diameter to be no
larger than 90 or 95 percent of the size that a pump could take, so as to provide reserve
head. If this reserve is used only 5 percent of the time, all such pumps will be operat-
ing at less than full efficiency most of the time.
4. Advantages of allowing operation to the right of the best efficiency point. Some speci-
fications, the result of such thinking as that which provides reserve head, prohibit the
selection of pumps that would operate to the right of the best efficiency point. This

eliminates half of the pumps that might be selected and results in oversized pumps op-
erating at lower efficiency.

This procedure is the work of John H. Doolin, Director of Product Development, Wor-
thington Pumps, Inc., as reported in Chemical Engineering magazine.

SMALL HYDRO POWER CONSIDERATIONS
AND ANALYSIS

A city is considering a small hydro power installation to save fossil fuel. To obtain the
savings, the following steps will be taken: refurbish an existing dam, install new turbines,
operate the generating plant. Outline the considerations a designer must weigh before un-
dertaking the actual construction of such a plant.

Calculation Procedure:
1. Analyze the available head

Most small hydro power sites today will have a head of less than 50 ft (15.2 m) between
the high-water level and tail-water level, Fig. 15. The power-generating capacity will usu-
ally be 25 MW or less.

2. Relate absolute head to water flow rate

Because heads across the turbine in small hydro installations are often low in magnitude,
the tail-water level is important in assessing the possibilities of a given site. At high-water
flows, tail-water levels are often high enough to reduce turbine output, Fig. 16a. At some
sites, the available head at high flow is extremely low, Fig. 166.

FIGURE 15. Vertical Francis turbine in open pit was adapted to 8-m head
in an existing Norwegian dam. (Power.)

The actual power output from a hydro station is P = HQwe/550, where P = horse-
power output; H = head across turbine, ft; Q = water flow rate, ft3/s; w = weight of wa-
ter, lb/ft3; e = turbine efficiency. Substituting in this equation for the plant shown in Fig.
I6b, for flow rates of 500 and 1500 m3/s, we see that a tripling of the water flow rate
increases the power output by only 38.7 percent, while the absolute head drops 53.8 per-
cent (from 3.9 to 1.8 m). This is why the tail-water level is so important in small hydro
installations.
Figure c shows how station costs can rise as head decreases. These costs were esti-
mated by the Department of Energy (DOE) for a number of small hydro power installa-
tions. Figure 16 shows that station cost is more sensitive to head than to power capacity,
according to DOE estimates. And the prohibitive costs for developing a completely new
small hydro site mean that nearly all work will be at existing dams. Hence, any water ex-
ploitation for power must not encroach seriously on present customs, rights, and usages of
the water. This holds for both upstream and downstream conditions.

3. Outline machinery choice considerations

standard designs that will match any site needs in regard to head, capacity, and excavation
restrictions.
The Francis turbine, Fig. 15, is a good example of such designs. A horizontal-shaft
Francis turbine may be a better choice for some small projects because of lower civil-en-
gineering costs and compatibility with standard generators.
Efficiency of small turbines is a big factor in station design. The problem of full-load
versus part-load efficiency, Fig. 17, must be considered. If several turbines can fit the site
needs, then good part-load efficiency is possible by load sharing.
Fitting new machinery to an existing site requires ingenuity. If enough of the old pow-
erhouse is left, the same setup for number and type of turbines might be used. In other in-
stallations the powerhouse may be absent, badly deteriorated, or totally unsuitable. Then
river-flow studies should be made to determine which of the new semistandard machines
will best fit the conditions.
Personnel costs are extremely important in small hydro projects. Probably very few
small hydro projects centered on redevelopment of old sites can carry the burden of work-
ers in constant attendance. Hence, personnel costs should be given close attention.
Tube and bulb turbines, with horizontal or nearly horizontal shafts, are one way to
solve the problem of fitting turbines into a site without heavy excavation or civil engi-
neering works. Several standard and semistandard models are available.
In low head work, the turbine is usually low-speed, far below the speed of small gen-
erators. A speed-increasing gear box is therefore required. A simple helical-gear unit is
satisfactory for vertical-shaft and horizontal-shaft turbines. Where a vertical turbine
drives a horizontal generator, a right-angle box makes the turn in the power flow.
Governing and control equipment is not a serious problem for small hydro plants.
Related Calculations. Most small hydro projects are justified on the basis of
continuing inflation which will make the savings they produce more valuable as time
passes. Although this practice is questioned by some people, the recent history of infla-
tion seems to justify the approach.
As fossil-fuel prices increase, small hydro installations will become more feasible.
However, the considerations mentioned in this procedure should be given full weight be-
fore proceeding with the final design of any plant. The data in this procedure were drawn
from an ASME meeting on the subject with information from papers, panels, and discus-
sion summarized by William O'Keefe, Senior Editor, Power magazine, in an article in
that publication.

"CLEAN" ENERGY FROM SMALL-SCALE
HYDRO SITES

A newly discovered hydro site provides a potential head of 65 ft (20 m). An output of
10,000 kW (10 MW) is required to justify use of the site. Select suitable equipment for
this installation based on the available head and the required power output.

Calculation Procedure:
1. Determine the type of hydraulic turbine suitable for this site

Enter Fig. 18 on the left at the available head, 65 ft (20 m), and project to the right to in-
tersect the vertical projection from the required turbine output of 10,000 kW (10 MW).
These two lines intersect in the standardized tubular unit region. Hence, such a hydrotur-
bine will be tentatively chosen for this site.

2. Check the suitability of the chosen unit

Enter Table 5 at the top at the operating head range of 65 ft (20 m) and project across to
the left to find that a tubular-type hydraulic turbine with fixed blades and adjustable gates
will produce 0.25 to 15 MW of power at 55 to 150 percent of rated head. These ranges are
within the requirements of this installation. Hence, the type of unit indicated by Fig. 18 is
suitable for this hydro site.
Related Calculations. Passage of legislation requiring utilities to buy electric
power from qualified site developers is leading to strong growth of both site development
and equipment suitable for small-scale hydro plants. Environmental concerns over fossil-
fuel-fired and nuclear generating plants make hydro power more attractive. Hydro plants,
in general, do not pollute the air, do not take part in the acid-rain cycle, are usually remote
from populated areas, and run for up to 50 years with low maintenance and repair costs.
Environmentalists rate hydro power as "clean" energy available with little, or no, pollu-
tion of the environment.

To reduce capital cost, most site developers choose standard-design hydroturbines.
With essentially every high-head site developed, low-head sites become more attractive to
developers. Table 5 shows the typical performance characteristics of hydroturbines being
used today. Where there is a region of overlap in Table 5 or Fig. 18, site-specific parame-
ters dictate choice and whether to install large units or a greater number of small units.
Delivery time and ease of maintenance are other factors important in unit choice. Fur-
ther, the combination of power-generation and irrigation services in some installations
make hydroturbines more attractive from an environmental view because two objectives
are obtained: (1) "clean" power, and (2) crop watering.
Maintenance considerations are paramount with any selection; each day of downtime
is lost revenue for the plant owner. For example, bulb-type units for heads between 10
and 60 ft (3 and 18m) have performance characteristics similar to those of Francis and tu-
bular units, and are often 1 to 2 percent more efficient. Also, their compact and, in some
cases, standard design makes for smaller installations and reduced structural costs, but
they suffer from poor accessibility. Sometimes the savings arising from the unit's com-
pactness are offset by increased costs for the watertight requirements. Any leakage can
cause severe damage to the machine.
To reduce the costs of hydroturbines, suppliers are using off-the-shelf equipment. One
way this is done is to use centrifugal pumps operated in reverse and coupled to an induc-
tion motor. Although this is not a novel concept, pump manufacturers have documented
the capability of many readily available commercial pumps to run as hydroturbines. The
peak efficiency as a turbine is at least equivalent to the peak efficiency as a pump. These
units can generate up to 1 MW of power. Pumps also benefit from a longer history of cost
reductions in manufacturing, a wider range of commercial designs, faster delivery, and
easier servicing—all of which add up to more rapid and inexpensive installations.
Though a reversed pump may begin generating power ahead of a turbine installation,
it will not generate electricity more efficiently. Pumps operated in reverse are nominally 5
to 10 percent less efficient than a standard turbine for the same head and flow conditions.
This is because pumps operate at fixed flow and head conditions; otherwise efficiency
falls off rapidly. Thus, pumps do not follow the available water load as well unless multi-
ple units are used.
With multiple units, the objective is to provide more than one operating point at sites
with significant flow variations. Then the units can be sequenced to provide the maximum
power output for any given flow rate. However, as the number of reverse pump units in-
creases, equipment costs approach those for a standard turbine. Further, the complexity of
the site increases with the number of reverse pump units, requiring more instrumentation
and automation, especially if the site is isolated.
Energy-conversion-efficiency improvements are constantly being sought. In low-head
applications, pumps may require specially designed draft tubes to minimize remaining en-
ergy after the water exists from the runner blades. Other improvements being sought for
pumps are: (1) modifying the runner-blade profiles or using a turbine runner in a pump
casing, (2) adding flow-control devices such as wicket gates to a standard pump design or
stay vanes to adjust turbine output.
Many components of hydroturbines are being improved to reduce space requirements
and civil costs, and to simplify design, operation, and maintenance. Cast parts used in old-
er turbines have largely been replaced by fabricated components. Stainless steel is com-
monly recommended for guide vanes, runners, and draft-tube inlets because of better re-
sistance to cavitation, erosion, and corrosion. In special cases, there are economic tradeoffs
between using carbon steel with a suitable coating material and using stainless steel.
Some engineers are experimenting with plastics, but much more long-term experience
is needed before most designers will feel comfortable with plastics. Further, stainless

steel material costs are relatively low compared to labor costs. And stainless steel has
proven most cost-effective for hydroturbine applications.
While hydro power does provide pollution-free energy, it can be subject to the va-
garies of the weather and climatic conditions. Thus, at the time of this writing, some 30
hydroelectric stations in the northwestern part of the United States had to cut their electri-
cal output because the combination of a severe drought and prolonged cold weather
forced a reduction in water flow to the stations. Purchase of replacement power—usually
from fossil-fuel-fired plants—may be necessary when such cutbacks occur. Thus, the
choice of hydro power must be carefully considered before a final decision is made.
This procedure is based on the work of Jason Makansi, associate editor, Power maga-
zine, and reported in that publication.

USE OF SOLAR-POWERED PUMPS IN
IRRIGATION AND OTHER SERVICES

Devise a solar-powered alternative energy source for driving pumps for use in irrigation
to handle 10,000 gal/min (37.9 m3/min) at peak output with an input of 50 hp (37.3 kW).
Show the elements of such a system and how they might be interconnected to provide
useful output.

Calculation Procedure:
1. Develop a suitable cycle for this application

Figure 19 shows a typical design of a closed-cycle solar-energy powered system suitable
for driving turbine-powered pumps. In this system a suitable refrigerant is chosen to pro-
vide the maximum heat absorption possible from the sun's rays. Water is pumped under
pressure to the solar collector, where it is heated by the sun. The water then flows to a
boiler where the heat in the water turns the liquid refrigerant into a gas. This gas is used to
drive a Rankine-cycle turbine connected to an irrigation pump, Fig. 19.
The rate of gas release in such a closed system is a function of (a) the unit enthalpy of
vaporization of the refrigerant chosen, (b) the temperature of the water leaving the solar
collector, and (c) the efficiency of the boiler used to transfer heat from the water to the re-
frigerant. While there will be some heat loss in the piping and equipment in the system,
this loss is generally considered negligible in a well-designed layout.

2. Select, and size, the solar collector to use

The usual solar collector chosen for systems such as this is a parabolic tracking-type unit.
The preliminary required area for the collector is found by using the rule of thumb which
states: For parabolic tracking-type solar collectors the required sun-exposure area is 0.55
ft2 per gal/min pumped (0.093 m2 per 0.00379 m3/min) at peak output of the pump and
collector. Another way of stating this rule of thumb is: Required tracking parabolic solar
collector area = 110 ft2 per hp delivered (13.7 m2/kW delivered).
Thus, for a solar collector designed to deliver 10,000 gal/min (37.9 m3/min) at peak
output, the preliminary area chosen for this parabolic tracking solar collector will be, Ap =
(10,000 gal/min)(0.55 ft2/gal/min) = 550 ft2 (511 m2). Or, using the second rule of thumb,
Ap = (UO)(SO) = 5500 ft2 (511 m2).
Final choice of the collector area will be based on data supplied by the collector man-
ufacturer, refrigerant choice, refrigerant properties, and the actual operating efficiency of
the boiler chosen.

In this solar-powered pumping system, water is drawn from a sump basin and pumped
to an irrigation canal where it is channeled to the fields. The 50-hp (37.3-kW) motor was
chosen because it is large enough to provide a meaningful demonstration of commercial
size and it can be scaled up to 200 to 250 hp (149.2 to 186.5 kW) quickly and easily.
Sensors associated with the solar collector aim it at the sun in the morning, and, as the
sun moves across the sky, track it throughout the day. These same sensing devices also
rotate the collectors to a storage position at night and during storms. This is done to lessen
the chance of damage to the reflective surfaces of the collectors. A backup control system
is available for emergencies.

3. Predict the probable operating mode of this system

In June, during the longest day of the year, the system will deliver up to 5.6 million gal-
lons (21,196 m3) over a 9.5-h period. Future provisions for energy storage can be made, if
needed.
Related Calculations. Solar-powered pumps can have numerous applications
beyond irrigation. Such applications could include domestic water pumping and storage,
ornamental fountain water pumping and recirculation, laundry wash water, etc. The
whole key to successful solar power for pumps is selecting a suitable application. With
the information presented in this procedure the designer can check the applicability and
economic justification of proposed future designs.
In today's environmentally-conscious design world, the refrigerant must be carefully
chosen so it is acceptable from both an ozone-depletion and from a thermodynamic stand-
point: Banned refrigerants should not, of course, be used, even if attractive from a ther-
modynamic standpoint.
This procedure is the work of the editorial staff of Product Engineering magazine re-
porting on the work of Battelle Memorial Institute and the Northwestern Mutual Life In-
surance Co. The installation described is located at MMLF s GiIa River Ranch, southwest
of Phoenix AZ. SI values were added by the handbook editor.

Water-We 11 Analysis

DETERMINING THE DRAWDOWN FOR
GRAVITY WATER-SUPPLY WELL

Determine the depth of water in a 24-in (61-cm) gravity well, 300 ft (91-m) deep, without
stopping the pumps, while the well is discharging 400 gal/mm (25.2 L/s). Tests show that
the drawdown in a test borehole 80 ft (24.4 m) away is 4 ft (1.2 m), and in a test borehole
20 ft (6.1 m) away, it is 18 ft (5.5 m). The distance to the static groundwater table is 54 ft
(16.5m).

Calculation Procedure:

1. Determine the key parameters of the well

Figure 1 shows a typical gravity well and the parameters associated with it. The Dupuit
formula, given in step 2, below, is frequently used in analyzing gravity wells. Thus, from
the given data, Q = 400 gal/mm (25.2 L/s); he = 300 - 54 = 246 ft (74.9 m); rw = 1 (0.3 m)
for the well, and 20 and 80 ft (6.1 and 24.4 m), respectively, for the boreholes. For this
well, hw is unknown; in the nearest borehole it is 246 - 18 = 228 ft (69.5 m); for the far-
thest borehole it is 246 - 4 = 242 ft (73.8 m). Thus, the parameters have been assembled.

2. Solve the Dupuit formula for the well

Substituting in the Dupuit formula

we have,

(246 + 228)(246-228)

Solving, re = 120 and K = 0.027. Then, for the well,

300-0.027 

Solving hw, = 195 ft (59.4 m). The drawdown in the well is 246 - 195 = 51 ft (15.5 m).
Related Calculations. The graph resulting from plotting the Dupuit formula
produces the "base-pressure curve," line ABCD in Fig. 1. It has been found in practice
that the approximation in using the Dupuit formula gives results of practical value. The

results obtained are most nearly correct when the ratio of drawdown to the depth of water
in the well, when not pumping, is low.
Figure 1 is valuable in analyzing both the main gravity well and its associated bore-
holes. Since gravity wells are, Fig. 2, popular sources of water supply throughout the world,
an ability to analyze their flow is an important design skill. Thus, the effect of the percent-
age of total possible drawdown on the percentage of total possible flow from a well, Fig. 3,
is an important design concept which finds wide use in industry today. Gravity wells are
highly suitable for supplying typical weekly water demands, Fig. 4, of a moderate-size city.
They are also suitable for most industrial plants having modest process-water demand.

FINDING THE DRAWDOWN OF A
DISCHARGING GRAVITY WELL

A gravity well 12 in (30.5 cm) in diameter is discharging 150 gal/mm (9.5 L/s), with a
drawdown of 10 ft (3 m). It discharges 500 gal/mm (31.6 L/s) with a drawdown of 50 ft
(15 m). The static depth of the water in the well is 150 ft (45.7 m). What will be the dis-
charge from the well with a drawdown of 20 ft (6 m)?

Calculation Procedure:
1. Apply the Dupuit formula to this well

Using the formula as given in the previous calculation procedure, we see that

2. Solve for the water flow by trial

Solving by successive trial using the results in step 1, we find Q = 257 gal/min (16.2 L/s).
Related Calculations. If it is assumed, for purposes of convenience in compu-
tations, that the radius of the circle of influence, re, varies directly as Q for equilibrium
conditions, then re = CQ. Then the Dupuit equation can be rewritten as

(he + hw)(he~hw)
loglo (CS/O

U 

From this rewritten equation it can be seen that where the drawdown (he - hw) is small
compared with (he + hw) the value of Q varies approximately as (he - hw). This straight-
line relationship between the rate of flow and drawdown leads to the definition of the spe-
cific capacity of a well as the rate of flow per unit of drawdown, usually expressed in gal-
lons per minute per foot of drawdown (liters per second per meter). Since the relationship
is not the same for all drawdowns, it should be determined for one special foot (meter),
often the first foot (meter) of drawdown. The relationship is shown graphically in Fig. 3
for both gravity, Fig. 1, and pressure wells, Fig. 5. Note also that since K in different

aquifers is not the same, the specific capacities of wells in different aquifers are not al-
ways comparable.
It is possible, with the use of the equation for Q above, to solve some problems in
gravity wells by measuring two or more rates of flow and corresponding drawdowns in
the well to be studied. Observations in nearby test holes or boreholes are unnecessary.
The steps are outlined in this procedure.

by, as reported in their book, Water Supply Engineering, McGraw-Hill. SI values were

ANALYZING DRAWDOWN AND RECOVERY
FOR WELL PUMPED FOR EXTENDED PERIOD

Construct the drawdown-recovery curve for a gravity well pumped for two days at 450
gal/min (28.4 L/s). The following observations have been made during a test of the well
under equilibrium conditions: diameter, 2 ft (0.61 m); he = 50 ft (15.2 m); when Q = 450
gal/min (28.4 L/s), drawdown = 8.5 ft (2.6 m); and when rx = 60 ft (18.3 m), (he -hx) = 3
ft (0.91 m). The specific yield of the well is 0.25.

Calculation Procedure:
1. Determine the value of the constant k

Use the equation

k(he-hx)he 
^ QlOg10(VO-IW ^ 

QCx IQg10 W(UAJ
(he-hx)(he)

Determine the value of Cx when rw, is equal to the radius of the well, in this case 1.0. The
value of k can be determined by trial. Further, the same value of k must be given when rx
= re as when rx = 60 ft (18.3 m). In this procedure, only the correct assumed value of re is
shown—to save space.
Assume that re = 350 ft (106.7 m). Then, 1/350 = 0.00286 and, from Fig. 6, Cx = 0.60.
Then k = (l)(0.60)(log 350/5)/(8)(50) = (1)(0.6)( 1.843)7400 = 0.00276, rjre = 60/350 =
0.172, and Cx = 0.225. Hence, checking the computed value of k, we have k =
(1)(0.22)(1.843)/150 = 0.0027, which checks with the earlier computed value.

2. Compute the head values using k from step 1

Compute he - (h2

e - 1.7 Q/k)°-5 = 50- (2500 - 1.7/0.0027)0-5 = 6.8.

3. Find the values of T to develop the assumed values of re

For example, assume that re = 100. Then T= (0.184)(100)2(0.25)(6.8)/1 = 3230 sec = 0.9
h, using the equation

T-(h FTT^i °-184r|f

l * « " V«

*/ Q

4. Calculate the radii ratio and d0

These computations are: rjrw = 100/1 = 100. Then, d0 = (6.8)(log10 100)/2.3 = 5.9 ft (1.8
m), using the equation

5. Compute other points on the drawdown curve

Plot the values found in step 4 on the drawdown-recovery curve, Fig. 7. Compute addi-
tional values of d0 and T and plot them on Fig. 7, as shown.

6. Make the recovery-curve computations

The recovery-curve, Fig. 7, computations are based the assumption that by imposing a
negative discharge on the positive discharge from the well there will be in effect zero
flow from the well, provided the negative discharge equals the positive discharge. Then,
the sum of the drawdowns due to the two discharges at any time T after adding the nega-
tive discharge will be the drawdown to the recovery curve, Fig. 7.
Assume some time after the pump has stopped, such as 6 h, and compute re, with Q, f,
k, and he as in step 3, above. Then re = [(6 x 3600 x 1)/(0.184 x 0.25 x 6.8)]°-5 = 263 ft
(80.2 m). Then, re/rw = 263; check.

7. Find the value of d0 corresponding to re in step 6

Computing, we have J0 = (6.8)(log10)/2.3 = 7.15 ft (2.2 m). Tabulate the computed values
as shown in Table 1 where the value 7.15 is rounded off to 7.2.
Compute the value of re using the total time since pumping started. In this case it is 48
+ 6 = 54 h. Then re = [(54 x 3600 x 1)7(0.184 x 0.25 x 6.8)]°-5 = 790 ft (240.8 m). The J0
corresponding to the preceding value of re = 790 ft (240.8 m) is d0
 = (6.8)(log10 790)/2.3
= 8.55 ft (2.6 m).

8. Find the recovery value

The recovery value, dr = 8.55 - 7.15 = 1.4 ft (0.43 m). Coordinates of other points on the
recovery curve are computed in a similar fashion. Note that the recovery curve does not
attain the original groundwater table because water has been removed from the aquifer
and it has not been restored.
Related Calculations. If water is entering the area of a well at a rate q and is be-
ing pumped out at the rate Q with Q greater than q, then the value of Q to be used in
computing the drawdown recovery is Q - q. If this difference is of appreciable magni-
tude, a correction must be made because of the effect of the inflow from the aquifer into

SELECTION OF AIR-LIFT PUMP
FOR WATER WELL

Select the overall features of an air-lift pump, Fig. 8, to lift 350 gal/min (22.1 LI s) into a
reservoir at the ground surface. The distance to groundwater surface is 50 ft (15.2 m). It is
expected that the specific gravity of the well is 14 gal/min/ft (2.89 L/s/m).

Calculation Procedure:

1. Find the well drawdown, static lift, and depth of this well

The drawdown at 350 gal/min is d = 350/14 - 25 ft (7.6 m). The static lift, h, is the sum of
the distance from the groundwater surface plus the drawdown, or h = 50 + 25 = 75 ft (22.9
m).
Interpolating in Table 2 gives a submergence percentage of s = 0.61. Then, the depth
of the well, D ft is related to the submergence percentage thus: s = DI(D + h). Or, 0.61 =
DI(D + 75); D = 117 ft (35.8 m). The depth of the well is, therefore, 75 + 117 = 192 ft
(58.5 m).

2. Determine the required capacity of the air compressor

The rate of water flow in cubic feet per second, Qw is given by Q^ - gal/min/(60
min/s)(7.5 fVVgal) = 350/(60)(7.5) = 0.78 ft3/s (0.022 m3/s). Then the volume of free air
required by the air-lift pump is given by

usually taken as 6 ft (1.8 m) for deep wells, down to 1 ft (0.3 m) for shallow wells; E —
efficiency of pump, approximated from Table 3; r = ratio of compression = (D + 34)/34.
Substituting, using 6 ft (1.8 m) since this is a deep well, we have, Qa = (0.779 x 81)7(75 x
0.35 x 0.646) = 3.72 ft3/s (0.11 m3/s).

3. Size the air pipe and determine the operating pressures

The cross-sectional area of the pipe = QJV. At the bottom of the well, Q'a = 3.72 (34/151)
= 0.83 ft3/s (0.023 m3/s). With a flow velocity of the air typically at 2000 ft/mm (610
m/min), or 33.3 ft/s (10 rn/s), the area of the air pipe is 0.83/ 33.3 = 0.025 ft2, and the di-
ameter is [(0.025 x 4)/7r]05 = 0.178 ft or 2.1 in (53.3 mm); use 2-in (50.8 mm) pipe.
The pressure at the start is 142 ft (43 m); operating pressure is 117 ft (35.7 m).

4. Size the eductor pipe

At the well bottom, A = QIV. Q = Qw + Q'a = 0.78 + 0.83 = 1.612 ftVs (0.45 m3/s). The ve-
locity at the entrance to the eductor pipe is 4.9 ft/s (1.9 m/s) from a table of eductor en-
trance velocities, available from air-lift pump manufacturers. Then, the pipe area, A = QIV
= 1.61/4.9 = 0.33. Hence, d = [(4 x 0.33)/7r)]05 - 0.646 ft, or 7.9 in Use 8-in (203 mm)
pipe.
If the eductor pipe is the same size from top to bottom, then Fat top = (Q0 + QW)/A =
(3.72 + 0.78)(4)/(7r x 0.6672) = 13 ft/s (3.96 m/s). This is comfortably within the permis-
sible maximum limit of 20 ft/s (6.1 m/s). Hence, 8-in pipe is suitable for this eductor pipe.
Related Calculations. In an air-lift pump serving a water well, compressed air
is released through an air diffuser (also called a foot piece) at the bottom of the eductor
pipe. Rising as small bubbles, a mixture of air and water is created that has a lower spe-
cific gravity than that of water alone. The rising air bubbles, if sufficiently large, create an
upward water flow in the well, to deliver liquid at the ground level.
Air lifts have many unique features not possessed by other types of well pumps. They
are the simplest and the most foolproof type of pump. In operation, the airlift pump gives
the least trouble because there are no remote or submerged moving parts. Air lifts can be
operated successfully in holes of any practicable size. They can be used in crooked holes

not suited to any other type of pump. An air-lift pump can draw more water from a well,
with sufficient capacity to deliver it, than any other type of pump that can be installed in a
well. A number of wells in a group can be operated from a central control station where
the air compressor is located.
The principal disadvantages of air lifts are the necessity for making the well deeper
than is required for other types of well pumps, the intermittent nature of the flow from the
well, and the relatively low efficiencies obtained. Little is known of the efficiency of the
average air-lift installation in small waterworks. Tests show efficiencies in the neighbor-
hood of 45 percent for depths of 50 ft (15 m) down to 20 percent for depths of 600 ft (183
m). Changes in efficiencies resulting from different submergence ratios are shown in
Table 3. Some submergence percentages recommended for various lifts are shown in
Table 2.

Water-Supply and Storm-Water System Design

WATER-SUPPLY SYSTEM FLOW-RATE
AND PRESSURE-LOSS ANALYSIS

A water-supply system will serve a city of 100,000 population. Two water mains
arranged in a parallel configuration (Fig. 9a) will supply this city. Determine the flow
rate, size, and head loss of each pipe in this system. If the configuration in Fig. 9a
were replaced by the single pipe shown in Fig. 9b, what would the total head loss be if

FIGURE 9. 
bution system.

(a) Parallel water distribution system: (b) single-pipe distri-

C = 100 and the flow rate were reduced to 2000 gal/min (126.2 L/s)? Explain how the
Hardy Cross method is applied to the water-supply piping system in Fig. 11.

Calculation Procedure:
1. Compute the domestic water flow rate in the system

Use an average annual domestic water consumption of 150 gal/day (0.0066 L/s) per capi-
ta. Hence, domestic water consumption = (150 gal per capita per day)( 100,000 persons) =
15,000,000 gal/day (657.1 L/s). To this domestic flow, the flow required for fire protec-
tion must be added to determine the total flow required.

2. Compute the required flow rate for fire protection

Use the relation Qf= 1020(P)05 [1 - 0.01(P)05], where Qf= fire flow, gal/min; P = popu-
lation in thousands. Substituting gives Qf= 1020(10O)05 [1 - 0.01(10O)05] = 9180, say
9200 gal/min (580.3 L/s).

3. Apply a load factor to the domestic consumption

To provide for unusual water demands, many design engineers apply a 200 to 250 percent
load factor to the average hourly consumption that is determined from the average annual
consumption. Thus, the average daily total consumption determined in step 1 is based on
an average annual daily demand. Convert the average daily total consumption in step 1 to
an average hourly consumption by dividing by 24 h or 15,000,000/24 = 625,000 gal/h
(657.1 L/s). Next, apply a 200 percent load factor. Or, design hourly demand =
2.00(625,000) = 1,250,000 gal/h (1314.1 L/s), or 1,250,000/60 min/h = 20,850, say
20,900 gal/min (1318.6 L/s).

4. Compute the total water flow required

The total water flow required = domestic flow, gal/min + fire flow, gal/min = 20,900 +
9200 = 30,100 gal/min (1899.0 L/s). If this system were required to supply water to one
or more industrial plants in addition to the domestic and fire flows, the quantity needed by
the industrial plants would be added to the total flow computed above.

5. Select the flow rate for each pipe

The flow rate is not known for either pipe in Fig. 9a. Assume that the shorter pipe a has a
flow rate Qa of 12,100 gal/min (763.3 L/s), and the longer pipe b a flow rate Qb of 18,000
gal/min (1135.6 L/s). Thus, Qa + Qb = Qt= 12,100 + 18,000 = 30,100 gal/min (1899.0
L/s), where Q = flow, gal/min, in the pipe identified by the subscript a or b; Qt = total
flow in the system, gal/min.

6. Select the sizes of the pipes in the system

Since neither pipe size is known, some assumptions must be made about the system. First,
assume that a friction-head loss of 10 ft of water per 1000 ft (3.0 m per 304.8 m) of pipe is
suitable for this system. This is a typical allowable friction-head loss for water-supply
systems.
Second, assume that the pipe is sized by using the Hazen-Williams equation with the
coefficient C = 100. Most water-supply systems are designed with this equation and this
value of C.
Enter Fig. 10 with the assumed friction-head loss of 10 ft/ 1000 ft (3.0 m/304.8 m)
of pipe on the right-hand scale, and project through the assumed Hazen-Williams
coefficient C= 100. Extend this straight line until it intersects the pivot axis. Next, en-
ter Fig. 10 on the left-hand scale at the flow rate in pipe a, 12,100 gal/min (763.3 L/s),
and project to the previously found intersection on the pivot axis. At the intersection
with the pipe-diameter scale, read the required pipe size as 27-in (686-mm) diameter.

Note that if the required pipe size falls between two plotted sizes, the next larger size is
used.
Now in any parallel piping system, the friction-head loss through any branch connect-
ing two common points equals the friction-head loss in any other branch connecting the
same two points. Using Fig. 10 for a 27-in (686-mm) pipe, find the actual friction-head
loss at 8 ft/1000 ft (2.4 m/304.8 m) of pipe. Hence, the total friction-head loss in pipe a is

(2000 ft long)(8 ft/1000 ft) = 16 ft (4.9 m) of water. This is also the friction-head loss in
pipe b.
Since pipe b is 3000 ft (914.4 m) long, the friction-head loss per 1000 ft (304.8 m) is
total head loss, ft/length of pipe, thousands of ft = 16/3 = 5.33 ft/1000 ft (1.6 m/304.8 m).
Enter Fig. 10 at this friction-head loss and C= 100. Project in the same manner as de-
scribed for pipe a, and find the required size of pipe b as 33 in (838.2 mm).
If the district being supplied by either pipe required a specific flow rate, this flow
would be used instead of assuming a flow rate. Then the pipe would be sized in the same
manner as described above.

7. Compute the single-pipe equivalent length

When we deal with several different sizes of pipe having the same flow rate, it is often
convenient to convert each pipe to an equivalent length of a common-size pipe. Many de-
sign engineers use 8-in (203-mm) pipe as the common size. Table 4 shows the equivalent
length of 8-in (203-mm) pipe for various other sizes of pipe with C = 90, 100, and 110 in
the Hazen-Williams equation.
From Table 4, for 12-in (305-mm) pipe, the equivalent length of 8-in (203-mm) pipe is
0.14 ft/ft when C= 100. Thus, total equivalent length of 8-in (203-mm) pipe = (1000 ft of
12-in pipe)(0.14 ft/ft) = 140 ft (42.7 m) of 8-in (203-mm) pipe. For the 14-in (356-mm)
pipe, total equivalent length = (600)(0.066) = 39.6 ft (12.1 m), using similar data from
Table 4. For the 16-in (406-mm) pipe, total equivalent length = (1400)(0.034) = 47.6 ft
(14.5 m). Hence, total equivalent length of 8-in (203-mm) pipe = 140 + 39.6 + 47.6 =
227.2 ft (69.3 m).

8. Determine the friction-head loss in the pipe

Enter Fig. 10 at the flow rate of 2000 gal/min (126.2 L/s), and project through 8-in
(203-mm) diameter to the pivot axis. From this intersection, project through C = 100
to read the friction-head loss as 100 ft/ 1000 ft (30.5 m/304.8 m), due to the friction
of the water in the pipe. Since the equivalent length of the pipe is 227.2 ft (69.3 m),
the friction-head loss in the compound pipe is (227.2/ 100O)(IlO) = 25 ft (7.6 m) of wa-
ter.

Related Calculations. Two pipes, two piping systems, or a single pipe and a
system of pipes are said to be equivalent when the losses of head due to friction for equal
rates of flow in the pipes are equal.
To determine the flow rates and friction-head losses in complex waterworks distri-
bution systems, the Hardy Cross method of network analysis is often used. This
method1 uses trial and error to obtain successively more accurate approximations of the
flow rate through a piping system. To apply the Hardy Cross method: (1) Sketch the
piping system layout as in Fig. 11. (2) Assume a flow quantity, in terms of percentage
of total flow, for each part of the piping system. In assuming a flow quantity note that
(a) the loss of head due to friction between any two points of a closed circuit must be
the same by any path by which the water may flow, and (b) the rate of inflow into any
section of the piping system must equal the outflow. (3) Compute the loss of head due
to friction between two points in each part of the system, based on the assumed flow in
(a) the clockwise direction and (b) the counterclockwise direction. A difference in the
calculated friction-head losses in the two directions indicates an error in the assumed di-
rection of flow. (4) Compute a counterflow correction by dividing the difference in
head, Ah ft, by n(Q)n~l, where w = 1.85 and Q = flow, gal/min. Indicate the direction of
this counterflow in the pipe by an arrow starting at the right side of the smaller value of
h and curving toward the larger value. Fig. 11. (5) Add or subtract the counterflow to or

Example: r for 12-in (305-mm) pipe 4000 ft (1219 m) long, with C= 100, is 1.2 x 4.0 = 4.8.
"Head loss in ft (m) = r x IQ-5 x Q^ 85 per 10QO ft (304.8 m), Q representing gal/min (L/s).

from the assumed flow, depending on whether its direction is the same or opposite. (6)
Repeat this process on each circuit in the system until a satisfactory balance of flow is
obtained.
To compute the loss of head due to friction, step 3 of the Hardy Cross method, use any
standard formula, such as the Hazen-Williams, that can be reduced to the form h = rQ"L,
where h = head loss due to friction, ft of water; r = a coefficient depending on the diame-
ter and roughness of the pipe; Q = flow rate, gal/min; n = 1.85; L = length of pipe, ft.
Table 5 gives values of r for 1000-ft (304.8-in) lengths of various sizes of pipe and for
different values of the Hazen-Williams coefficient C. When the percentage of total flow is
used for computing Sh in Fig. 11, the loss of head due to friction in ft between any two
points for any flow in gal/min is computed from h = [Sh (by percentage of flow)/
100,000] (gal/min/ 10O)085. Figure 11 shows the details of the solution using the Hardy
Cross method. The circled numbers represent the flow quantities. Table 6 lists values of
numbers between O and 100 to the 0.85 power.

WATER-SUPPLY SYSTEM SELECTION

Choose the type of water-supply system for a city having a population of 100,000 per-
sons. Indicate which type of system would be suitable for such a city today and 20 years
hence. The city is located in an area of numerous lakes.

Calculation Procedure:
1. Compute the domestic water flow rate in the system

Use an average annual domestic water consumption of 150 gal per capita day (gcd) (6.6
mL/s). Hence, domestic water consumption = (150 gal per capita day)( 100,000 persons) =
15,000,000 gal/day (657.1 L/s). To this domestic flow, the flow required for fire protec-
tion must be added to determine the total flow required.

2. Compute the required flow rate for fire protection

Use the relation Qf= 1020(P)05 [1 - 0.01(P)05], where Qf= fire flow, gal/min; P = popu-
lation in thousands. So Qf= 1020(10O)05 [1 - 0.01 x (10O)05] - 9180, say 9200 gaVmin
(580.3 L/s).

3. Apply a load factor to the domestic consumption

To provide for unusual water demands, many design engineers apply a 200 to 250 percent
load factor to the average hourly consumption that is determined from the average annual
consumption. Thus, the average daily total consumption determined in step 1 is based on
an average annual daily demand. Convert the average daily total consumption in step 1 to
an average hourly consumption by dividing by 24 h, or 15,000,000/24 = 625,000 gal/h
(657.1 L/s). Next, apply a 200 percent load factor. Or, design hourly demand =
2.00(625,000) = 1,250,000 gal/h (1314.1 L/s), or 1,250,0007(60 min/h) = 20,850, say
20,900 gal/min (1318.4 L /s).

4. Compute the total water flow required

The total water flow required = domestic flow, gal/min + fire flow, gal/min = 20,900 +
9200 = 30,100 gal/min (1899.0 L/s). If this system were required to supply water to one
or more industrial plants in addition to the domestic and fire flows, the quantity needed by
the industrial plants would be added to the total flow computed above.

5. Study the water supplies available

Table 7 lists the principal sources of domestic water supplies. Wells that are fed by
groundwater are popular in areas having sandy or porous soils. To determine whether a

well is suitable for supplying water in sufficient quantity, its specific capacity (i.e., the
yield in gal/min per foot of drawdown) must be determined.
Wells for municipal water sources may be dug, driven, or drilled. Dug wells seldom
exceed 60 ft (18.3 m) deep. Each such well should be protected from surface-water leak-
age by being lined with impervious concrete to a depth of 15 ft (4.6 m).
Driven wells seldom are more than 40 ft (12.2 m) deep or more than 2 in (51 mm) in
diameter when used for small water supplies. Bigger driven wells are constructed by driv-
ing large-diameter casings into the ground.
Drilled wells can be several thousand feet deep, if required. The yield of a driven well
is usually greater than any other type of well because the well can be sunk to a depth
where sufficient groundwater is available. Almost all wells require a pump of some kind
to lift the water from its subsurface location and discharge it to the water-supply system.
Surface freshwater can be collected from lakes, rivers, streams, or reservoirs by sub-
merged-, tower-, or crib-type intakes. The intake leads to one or more pumps that dis-
charge the water to the distribution system or intermediate pumping stations. Locate in-
takes as far below the water surface as possible. Where an intake is placed less than 20 ft
(6.1 m) below the surface of the water, it may become clogged by sand, mud, or ice.
Choose the source of water for this system after studying the local area to determine
the most economical source today and 20 years hence. With a rapidly expanding popula-
tion, the future water demand may dictate the type of water source chosen. Since this city
is in an area of many lakes, a surface supply would probably be most economical, if the
water table is not falling rapidly.

6. Select the type of pipe to use

Four types of pipes are popular for municipal water-supply systems: cast iron, asbestos
cement, steel, and concrete. Wood-stave pipe was once popular, but it is now obsolete.
Some communities also use copper or lead pipes. However, the use of both types is ex-
tremely small when compared with the other types. The same is true of plastic pipe, al-
though this type is slowly gaining some acceptance.
In general, cast-iron pipe proves dependable and long-lasting in water-supply systems
that are not subject to galvanic or acidic soil conditions.
Steel pipe is generally used for long, large-diameter lines. Thus, the typical steel pipe
used in water-supply systems is 36 or 48 in (914 or 1219 mm) in diameter. Use steel pipe
for river crossings, on bridges, and for similar installations where light weight and high
strength are required. Steel pipe may last 50 years or more under favorable soil condi-
tions. Where unfavorable soil conditions exist, the lift of steel pipe may be about 20
years.
Concrete-pipe use is generally confined to large, long lines, such as aqueducts. Con-
crete pipe is suitable for conveying relatively pure water through neutral soil. However,
corrosion may occur when the soil contains an alkali or an acid.
Asbestos-cement pipe has a number of important advantages over other types. Howev-
er, it does not flex readily, it can be easily punctured, and it may corrode in acidic soils.
Select the pipe to use after a study of the local soil conditions, length of runs required,
and the quantity of water that must be conveyed. Usual water velocities in municipal water
systems are in the 5-ft/s (1.5-m/s) range. However, the velocities in aqueducts range from
10 to 20 ft/s (3.0 to 6.1 m/s). Earthen canals have much lower velocities—1 to 3 ft/s (0.3 to
0.9 m/s). Rock- and concrete-lined canals have velocities of 8 to 15 ft/s (2.4 to 4.6 m/s).
In cold northern areas, keep in mind the occasional need to thaw frozen pipes during
the winter. Nonmetallic pipes—concrete, plastic, etc., as well as nonconducting metals—
cannot be thawed by electrical means. Since electrical thawing is probably the most prac-
tical method available today, pipes that prevent its use may put the water system at a dis-
advantage if subfreezing temperatures are common in the area served.

7. Select the method for pressurizing the water system

Water-supply systems can be pressurized in three different ways: by gravity or natural el-
evation head, by pumps that produce a pressure head, and by a combination of the first
two ways.
Gravity systems are suitable where the water storage reservoir or receiver is high
enough above the distribution system to produce the needed pressure at the farthest outlet.
The operating cost of a gravity system is lower than that of a pumped system, but the first
cost of the former is usually higher,. However, the reliability of the gravity system is usu-
ally higher because there are fewer parts that may fail.
Pumping systems generally use centrifugal pumps that discharge either directly to the
water main or to an elevated tank, a reservoir, or a standpipe. The water then flows from
the storage chamber to the distribution system. In general, most sanitary engineers prefer
to use a reservoir or storage tank between the pumps and distribution mains because this
arrangement provides greater reliability and fewer pressure surges.
Surface reservoirs should store at least a 1-day water supply. Most surface reservoirs
are designed to store a supply for 30 days or longer. Elevated tanks should have a capaci-
ty of at least 25 gal (94.6 L) of water per person served, plus a reserve for fire protection.
The capacity of typical elevated tanks ranges from a low of 40,000 gal (151 kL) for a
20-ft (6. 1-m) diameter tank to a high of 2,000,000 gal (7.5 ML) for an 80-ft (24.4-m) di-
ameter tank.
Choose the type of distribution system after studying the topography, water demand,
and area served. In general, a pumped system is preferred today. To ensure continuity of
service, duplicate pumps are generally used.

8. Choose the system operating pressure

In domestic water supply, the minimum pressure required at the highest fixture in a build-
ing is usually assumed to be 15 lb/in2 (103.4 kPa). The maximum pressure allowed at a
fixture in a domestic water system is usually 65 lb/in2 (448.2 kPa). High-rise buildings
(i.e., those above six stories) are generally required to furnish the pressure increase need-
ed to supply water to the upper stories. A pump and overhead storage tank are usually in-
stalled in such buildings to provide the needed pressure.
Commercial and industrial buildings require a minimum water pressure of 75 lb/in2
(517.1 kPa) at the street level for fire hydrant service. This hydrant should deliver at least
250 gal/min (15.8 L/s) of water for fire-fighting purposes.
Most water-supply systems served by centrifugal pumps in a central pumping station
operate in the 100-lb/in2 (689.5-kPa) pressure range. In areas of one- and two-story struc-
tures, a lower pressure, say 65 lb/in2 (448.2 kPa), is permissible. Where the pressure in a
system falls too low, auxiliary or booster pumps may be used. These pumps increase the
pressure in the main to the desired level.
Choose the system pressure based on the terrain served, quantity of water required, al-
lowable pressure loss, and size of pipe used in the system. Usual pressures required will
be in the ranges cited above, although small systems serving one-story residences may
operate at pressures as low as 30 lb/in2 (206.8 kPa). Pressures over 100 lb/in2 (689.5 kPa)
are seldom used because heavier piping is required. As a rule, distribution pressures of 50
to 75 lb/in2 (344.7 to 517.1 kPa) are acceptable.

9. Determine the number of hydrants for fire protection

Table 8 shows the required fire flow, number of standard hose streams of 250 gal/min

This means that 36 single-outlet or 18 dual-outlet hydrants are required. More, of course,
could be used if better protection were desired in the area. Note that the required fire flow
listed in Table 8 agrees closely with that computed in step 2 above.
Related Calculations. Use this general method for any water-supply system,
municipal or industrial. Note, however, that the required fire-protection quantities vary
from one type of municipal area to another and among different industrial exposures. Re-
fer to NFPA Handbook of Fire Protection, available from NFPA, 60 Batterymarch Street,
Boston, Massachusetts 02110, for specific fire-protection requirements for a variety of in-
dustries. In choosing a water-supply system, the wise designer looks ahead for at least 10
years when the water demand will usually exceed the present demand. Hence, the system
may be designed so it is oversized for the present population but just adequate for the fu-
ture population. The American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) publishes com-
prehensive data giving the usual water requirements for a variety of industries. Table 9
shows a few typical water needs for selected industries.

To determine the storage capacity required at present, proceed as follows: (1) Com-
pute the flow needed to meet 50 percent of the present domestic daily (that is, 24-h) de-
mand. (2) Compute the 4-h fire demand. (3) Find the sum of (1) and (2).
For this city, procedure (1) = (20,900 gal/min)(60 min/h)(24 h/day)(0.5) -
15,048,000 gal (57.2 ML) with the data computed in step 3. Also procedure (2) =
(4 h)(60 min/h)(9200 gal/min) = 2,208,000 gal (8.4 ML), using the data computed in
step 2, above. Then, total storage capacity required = 15,048,000 + 2,208,000 =
17,256,000 gal (65.3 ML). Where one or more reliable wells will produce a significant
flow for 4 h or longer, the storage capacity can be reduced by the 4-h productive ca-
pacity of the wells.

SELECTION OF TREATMENT METHOD
FOR WATER-SUPPLY SYSTEM

Choose a treatment method for a water-supply system for a city having a population of
100,000 persons. The water must be filtered, disinfected, and softened to make it suitable
for domestic use.

Calculation Procedure:
1. Compute the domestic water flow rate in the system

When water is treated for domestic consumption, only the drinking water passes through
the filtration plant. Fire-protection water is seldom treated unless it is so turbid that it will
clog fire pumps or hoses. Assuming that the fire-protection water is acceptable for use
without treatment, we consider only the drinking water here.
Use the same method as in steps 1 and 3 of the previous calculation procedure to de-
termine the required domestic water flow of 20,900 gal/min (1318.6 L/s) for this city.

2. Select the type of water-treatment system to use

Water supplies are treated by a number of methods including sedimentation, coagulation,
filtration, softening, and disinfection. Other treatments include disinfection, taste and
odor control, and miscellaneous methods.
Since the water must be filtered, disinfected, and softened, each of these steps must be
considered separately.

3. Choose the type of filtration to use

Slow sand filters operate at an average rate of 3 million gal/(acre-day) [2806.2
L/(m2-day)]. This type of filter removes about 99 percent of the bacterial content of the
water and most tastes and odors.
Rapid sand filters operate at an average rate of 150 million gal/(acre-day) [1.6
L/(m2-s)]. But the raw water must be treated before it enters the rapid sand filter. This
preliminary treatment often includes chemical coagulation and sedimentation. A high
percentage of bacterial content—up to 99.98 percent—is removed by the preliminary
treatment and the filtration. But color and turbidity removal is not as dependable as
with slow sand filters. Table 10 lists the typical limits for certain impurities in water
supplies.
The daily water flow rate for this city is, from step 1, (20,900 gal/min)(24 h/day)(60
min/h) = 30,096,000 gal/day (1318.6 L/s). If a slow sand filter were used, the required
area would be (30.096 million gal/day)/[3 million gal/(acre-day)] = 10+ acres (40,460
m2).

A rapid sand filter would require 30.096/150 - 0.2 acre (809.4 m2). Hence, if space
were scarce in this city—and it usually is—a rapid sand filter would be used. With this
choice of filtration, chemical coagulation and sedimentation are almost a necessity.
Hence, these two additional steps would be included in the treatment process.
Table 11 gives pertinent data on both slow and rapid sand filters. These data are useful
in filter selection.

4. Select the softening process to use

The principal water-softening processes use: (a) lime and sodium carbonate followed by
sedimentation or filtration, or both, to remove the precipitates and (b) zeolites of the sodi-
um type in a pressure filter. Zeolite softening is popular and is widely used in municipal
water-supply systems today. Based on its proven usefulness and economy, zeolite soften-
ing will be chosen for this installation.

5. Select the disinfection method to use

Chlorination by the addition of chlorine to the water is the principal method of disinfec-
tion used today. To reduce the unpleasant effects that may result from using chlorine
alone, a mixture of chlorine and ammonia, known as chloramine, may be used. The am-
monia dosage is generally 0.25 ppm or less. Assume that the chloramine method is cho-
sen for this installation.

6. Select the method of taste and odor control

The methods used for taste and odor control are: (a) aeration, (b) activated carbon, (c)
prechlorination, and (d) chloramine. Aeration is popular for groundwaters containing hy-
drogen sulfide and odors caused by microscopic organisms.
Activated carbon absorbs impurities that cause tastes, odors, or color, generally, 10 to
20 Ib (4.5 to 9.1 kg) of activated carbon per million gallons of water is used, but larger
quantities—from 50 to 60 Ib (22.7 to 27.2 kg)—may be specified. In recent years, some
2000 municipal water systems have installed activated carbon devices for taste and odor
control.
Prechlorination and chloramine are also used in some installations for taste and odor
control. Of the two methods, chloramine appears more popular at present.
Based on the data given for this water-supply system, method b, c, or d would proba-
bly be suitable. Because method b has proven highly effective, it will be chosen tentative-
ly, pending later investigation of the economic factors.
Related Calculations. Use this general procedure to choose the treatment
method for all types of water-supply systems where the water will be used for human con-
sumption. Thus, the procedure is suitable for municipal, commercial, and industrial sys-
tems.
Hazardous wastes of many types endanger groundwater supplies. One of the most
common hazardous wastes is gasoline which comes from the estimated 120,000 leaking
underground gasoline-storage tanks. Major oil companies are replacing leaking tanks
with new noncorrosive tanks. But the soil and groundwater must still be cleaned to pre-
vent pollution of drinking-water supplies.
Other contaminants include oily sludges, organic (such as pesticides and dioxins), and
nonvolatile organic materials. These present especially challenging removal and disposal
problems for engineers, particularly in view of the stringent environmental requirements
of almost every community.
A variety of treatment and disposal methods are in the process of development and
application. For oily waste handling, one process combines water evaporation and sol-
vent extraction to break down a wide variety of hazardous waste and sludge from
industrial, petroleum-refinery, and municipal-sewage-treatment operations. This process
typically produces dry solids with less than 0.5 percent residual hydrocarbon content.
This meets EPA regulations for nonhazardous wastes with low heavy-metal contents.
Certain organics, such as pesticides and dioxins, are hydrophobic. Liquified propane
and butane are effective at separating hydrophobic organics from solid particles in tainted
sludges and soils. The second treatment method uses liquified propane to remove organ-
ics from contaminated soil. Removal efficiencies reported are: poly chlorinated biphenyls
(PCBs) 99.9 percent; polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) 99.5 percent; dioxins 97.4 per-
cent; total petroleum hydrocarbons 99.9 percent. Such treated solids meet EPA land-ban
regulations for solids disposal.
Nonvolatile organic materials at small sites can be removed by a mobile treatment sys-
tem using up to 14 solvents. Both hydrophobic and hydrophilic solvents are used; all are
nontoxic; several have Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval as food additives.
Used at three different sites (at this writing) the process reduced PCB concentration from
500 to 1500 ppm to less than 100 ppm; at another site PCB concentration was reduced

from an average of 30 to 300 ppm to less than 5 ppm; at the third site PCBs were reduced
from 40 ppm to less than 3 ppm.

STORM-WATER RUNOFF RATE
AND RAINFALL INTENSITY

What is the storm-water runoff rate from a 40-acre (1.6-km2) industrial site having an im-
perviousness of 50 percent if the time of concentration is 15 min? What would be the ef-
fect of planting a lawn over 75 percent of the site?

Calculation Procedure:
1. Compute the hourly rate of rainfall

Two common relations, called the Talbot formulas, used to compute the hourly rate of
rainfall R in/h are R = 360/(/ + 30) for the heaviest storms and R = W5/(t + 15) for ordi-
nary storms, where t = time of concentration, min. Using the equation for the heaviest
storms because this relation gives a larger flow rate and produces a more conservative de-
sign, we see R = 3607(15 + 30) = 8 in/h (0.05 mm/s).

2. Compute the storm-water runoff rate

Apply the rational method to compute the runoff rate. This method uses the relation Q =
AIR, where Q = storm-water runoff rate, fWs; A = area served by sewer, acres; /= coeffi-
cient of runoff or percentage of imperviousness of the area; other symbols as before. So Q
= (40)(0.50)(8) = 160 fWs (4.5 m3/s).

3. Compute the effect of changed imperviousness

Planting a lawn on a large part of the site will increase the imperviousness of the soil.
This means that less rainwater will reach the sewer because the coefficient of impervious-
ness of a lawn is lower. Table 12 lists typical coefficients of imperviousness for various
surfaces. This tabulation shows that the coefficient for lawns varies from 0.05 to 0.25. Us-
ing a value of I= 0.10 for the 40(0.75) = 30 acres of lawn, we have Q = (3O)(0.10)(S) = 24
fWs (0.68 m3/s).
The runoff for the remaining 10 acres (40,460 m2) is, as in step 2, Q = (10)(0.5)(8) =

40 ft3/s (1.1 m3/s). Hence, the total runoff is 24 + 40 = 64 fWs (1.8 m3/s). This is 160 - 64
= 96 fWs (2.7 m3/s) less than when the lawn was not used.
Related Calculations. The time of concentration for any area being drained by
a sewer is the time required for the maximum runoff rate to develop. It is also defined as
the time for a drop of water to drain from the farthest point of the watershed to the sewer.
When rainfall continues for an extended period T min, the coefficient of impervious-
ness changes. For impervious surfaces such as watertight roofs, / = 77(8 + T). For im-
proved pervious surfaces, / = 0.377(20 + T). These relations can be used to compute the
coefficient in areas of heavy rainfall.
Equations for R for various areas of the United States are available in Steel—Water
Supply and Sewerage, McGraw-Hill. The Talbot formulas, however, are widely used and
have proved reliable.
The time of concentration for a given area can be approximated from t = 1(LISi2)113
where L = distance of overland flow of the rainfall from the most remote part of the site,
ft; S = slope of the land, ft/ft; i = rainfall intensity, in/h; other symbols as before. For por-
tions of the flow carried in ditches, the time of flow to the inlet can be computed by using
the Manning formula.
Table 13 lists the coefficient of runoff for specific types of built-up and industrial ar-
eas. Use these coefficients in the same way as shown above. Tables 12 and 13 present
data developed by Kuichling and ASCE.

SIZING SEWER PIPES FOR VARIOUS
FLOWRATES

Determine the size, flow rate, and depth of flow from a 1000-ft (304.8-m) long sewer
which slopes 5 ft (1.5 m) between inlet and outlet and which must carry a flow of 5 mil-
lion gal/day (219.1 L/s). The sewer will flow about half full. Will this sewer provide the
desired flow rate?

Calculation Procedure:
1. Compute the flow rate in the half-full sewer

A flow of 1 million gal/day = 1.55 ft3/s (0.04 m3/s). Hence, a flow of 5 million gal/day =
5(1.55) = 7.75 fWs (219.1 LIs) in a half-full sewer.

2. Compute the full-sewer flow rate

In a full sewer, the flow rate is twice that in a half-full sewer, or 2(7.75) = 15.50 ft3/s (0.44
m3/s) for this sewer. This is equivalent to 15.50/1.55 = 10 million gal/day (438.1 L/s).
Full-sewer flow rates are used because pipes are sized on the basis of being full of liquid.

3. Compute the sewer-pipe slope

The pipe slope S ft/ft = (E1 - EQ)/L9 where E1 = inlet elevation, ft above the site datum; E0
= outlet elevation, ft above site datum; L = pipe length between inlet and outlet, ft. Substi-
tuting gives S = 5/1000 = 0.005 ft/ft (0.005 in/in).

4. Determine the pipe size to use

The Manning formula v = (1.486/W)^273S172 is often used for sizing sewer pipes. In this
formula, v = flow velocity, ft/s; « = a factor that is a function of the pipe roughness; R
= pipe hydraulic radius = 0.25 pipe diameter, ft; S = pipe slope, ft/ft. Table 14 lists val-
ues of n for various types of sewer pipe. In sewer design, the value n = 0.013 for pipes
flowing full.
Since the Manning formula is complex, numerous charts have been designed to sim-
plify its solution. Figure 12 is one such typical chart designed specifically for sewers.
Enter Fig. 12 at 15.5 ft3/s (0.44 m3/s) on the left, and project through the slope ratio of
0.005. On the central scale between the flow rate and slope scales, read the next larger
standard sewer-pipe diameter as 24 in (610 mm). When using this chart, always read the
next larger pipe size.

5. Determine the fluid flow velocity

Continue the solution line of step 4 to read the fluid flow velocity as 5 ft/s (1.5 m/s) on the
extreme right-hand scale of Fig. 12. This is for a sewer flowing}w//.

6. Compute the half-full flow depth

Determine the full-flow capacity of this 24-in (610-mm) sewer by entering Fig. 12 at the
slope ratio, 0.005, and projecting through the pipe diameter, 24 in (610 mm). At the left
read the full-flow capacity as 16 ft3/s (0.45 m3/s).
The required half-flow capacity is 7.75 ftVs (0.22 m3/s), from step 1. Determine the
ratio of the required half-flow capacity to the full-flow capacity, both expressed in ft3/s
Or 7.75/16.0 = 0.484.
Enter Fig. 13 on the bottom at 0.484, and project vertically upward to the discharge
curve. From the intersection, project horizontally to the left to read the depth-of-flow ratio
as 0.49. This means that the depth of liquid in the sewer at a flow of 7.75 ft3/s (0.22 mVs)
is 0.49(24 in) = 11.75 in (29.8 cm). Hence, the sewer will be just slightly less than half
full when handling the designed flow quantity.

7. Compute the half-full flow velocity

Project horizontally to the right along the previously found 0.49 depth-of-flow ratio until
the velocity curve is intersected. From this intersection, project vertically downward to
the bottom scale to read the ratio of hydraulic elements as 0.99. Hence, the fluid velocity
when flowing half-full is 0.99(5.0 ft/s) = 4.95 ft/s (1.5 m/s).
Related Calculations, The minimum flow velocity required in sanitary sewers
is 2 ft/s (0.6 m/s). At 2 ft/s (0.6 m/s), solids will not settle out of the fluid. Since the ve-
locity in this sewer is 4.95 ft/s (1.5 m/s), as computed in step 7, the sewer meets, and ex-
ceeds, the minimum required flow velocity.
Certain localities have minimum slope requirements for sanitary sewers. The required
slope produces a minimum flow velocity of 2 ft/s (0.6 m/s) with an n value of 0.013.
Storm sewers handling rainwater and other surface drainage require a higher flow ve-
locity than sanitary sewers because sand and grit often enter a storm sewer. The usual
minimum allowable velocity for a storm sewer is 2.5 ft/s (0.76 m/s); where possible, the
sewer should be designed for 3.0 ft/s (0.9 m/s). If the sewer designed above were used for
storm service, it would be acceptable because the fluid velocity is 4.95 ft/s (1.5 m/s). To
prevent excessive wear of the sewer, the fluid velocity should not exceed 8 ft/s (2.4 m/s).

Note that Figs. 12 and 13 can be used whenever two variables are known. When a
sewer flows at 0.8, or more, full, the partial-flow diagram, Fig. 13, may not give accurate
results, especially at high flow velocities.

SEWER-PIPE EARTH LOAD AND
BEDDING REQUIREMENTS

A 36-in (914-mm) diameter clay sewer pipe is placed in a 15-ft (4.5-m) deep trench in
damp sand. What is the earth load on this sewer pipe? What bedding should be used for
the pipe? If a 5-ft (1.5-m) wide drainage trench weighing 2000 Ib/ft (2976.3 kg/m) of
length crosses the sewer pipe at right angles to the pipe, what load is transmitted to the
pipe? The bottom of the flume is 11 ft (3.4 m) above the top of the sewer pipe.

Calculation Procedure:
1. Compute the width of the pipe trench

Compute the trench width from w = 1.5d + 12, where w = trench width, in; d - sewer-pipe
diameter, in So w = 1.5(36) + 12 = 66 in (167.6 cm), or 5 ft 6 in (1.7 m).

2. Compute the trench depth-to-width ratio

To determine this ratio, subtract the pipe diameter from the depth and divide the result by
the trench width. Or, (15 - 3)/5.5 = 2.18.

3. Compute the load on the pipe

Use the relation L = kWw2, where L = pipe load, Ib/lin ft of trench; k = a constant from
Table 15; W= weight of the fill material used in the trench, lb/ft3 other symbol as before.

Enter Table 15 at the depth-to-width ratio of 2.18. Since this particular value is not
tabulated, use the next higher value, 2.5. Opposite this, read k = 1.70 for a sand filling.
Enter Table 16 at damp sand, and read the weight as 115 lb/ft3 (1842.1 kg/m3). With
these data the pipe load relation can be solved.
Substituting in L = kWw2, we get L = 1.70(115)(5.5)2 = 5920 lb/ft (86.4 N/mm). Study
of the properties of clay pipe (Table 17) shows that 36-in (914-mm) extra-strength clay
pipe has a minimum average crushing strength of 6000 Ib (26.7 kN) by the three,-edge-
bearing method.

4. Apply the loading safety factor

ASTM recommends a factor of safety of 1.5 for clay sewers. To apply this factor of safe-
ty, divide it into the tabulated three-edge-bearing strength found in step 3. Or, 6000/1.5 =
4000 Ib(17.8 kN).

5. Compute the pipe load-to-strength ratio

Use the strength found in step 4. Or pipe load-to-strength ratio (also called the load fac-
tor) = 5920/4000 = 1.48.

6. Select the bedding method for the pipe

Figure 14 shows methods for bedding sewer pipe and the strength developed. Thus, earth
embedment, type 2 bedding, develops a load factor of 1.5. Since the computed load fac-
tor, step 5, is 1.48, this type of bedding is acceptable. (In choosing a type of bedding be
certain that the load factor of the actual pipe is less than, or equals, the developed load
factor for the three-edge-bearing strength.)
The type 2 earth embedment, Fig. 14, is a highly satisfactory method, except that the
shaping of the lower part of the trench to fit the pipe may be expensive. Type 3 granular
embedment may be less expensive, particularly if the crushed stone, gravel, or shell is
placed by machine.

7. Compute the direct load transmitted to the sewer pipe

The weight of the drainage flume is carried by the soil over the sewer pipes. Hence, a por-
tion of this weight may reach the sewer pipe. To determine how much of the flume weight

reaches the pipe, find the weight of the flume per foot of width, or 2000 lb/5 ft = 400 Ib/ft
(5.84 kN/mm) of width.
Since the pipe trench is 5.5 ft (1.7 m) wide, step 1, the 1-ft (0.3-m) wide section of the
flume imposes a total load of 5.5(400) = 2200 Ib (9.8 KN) on the soil beneath it.
To determine what portion of the flume load reaches the sewer pipe, compute the ratio
of the depth of the flume bottom to the width of the sewer-pipe trench, or 11/5.5 = 2.0.
Enter Table 18 at a value of 2.0, and read the load proportion for sand and damp top-
soil as 0.35. Hence, the load of the flume reaching each foot of sewer pipe is 0.35(2200) =
770 Ib (3.4 KN).
Related Calculations. A load such as that in step 7 is termed a short load; i.e., it
is shorter than the pipe-trench width. Typical short loads result from automobile and truck
traffic, road rollers, building foundations, etc. Long loads are imposed by weights that are
longer than the trench is wide. Typical long loads are stacks of lumber, steel, and poles,

and piles of sand, coal, gravel, etc. Table 19 shows the proportion of long loads transmit-
ted to buried pipes. Use the same procedure as in step 7 to compute the load reaching the
buried pipe.
When a sewer pipe is placed on undisturbed ground and covered with fill, compute the
load on the pipe from L = kWd2, where d - pipe diameter, ft; other symbols as in step 3.
Tables 18 and 19 are the work of Prof. Anson Marston, Iowa State University.
To find the total load on trenched or surface-level buried pipes subjected to both fill
and long or short loads, add the proportion of the long or short load reaching the pipe to
the load produced by the fill.
Note that sewers may have several cross-sectional shapes—circular, egg, rectangular,
square, etc. The circular sewer is the most common because it has a number of advan-
tages, including economy. Egg-shaped sewers are not as popular as circular and are less
often used today because of their higher costs.
Rectangular and square sewers are often used for storm service. However, their hy-
draulic characteristics are not as desirable as circular sewers.

STORM-SEWER INLET SIZE AND FLOW RATE

What size storm-sewer inlet is required to handle a flow of 2 fWs (0.057 m3/s) if the gut-
ter is sloped % in/ft (2.1 cm/m) across the inlet and 0.05 in/ft (0.4 cm/m) along the length
of the inlet? The maximum depth of flow in the gutter is estimated to be 0.2 ft (0.06 m),
and the gutter is depressed 4 in (102 mm) below the normal street level.

Calculation Procedure:
1. Compute the reciprocal of the gutter transverse slope

The transverse slope of the gutter across the inlet is % in/ft (2.1 cm/m). Expressing the re-
ciprocal of this slope as r, compute the value for this gutter as r = 4 x 12/1 = 48.

2. Determine the inlet capacity per foot of length

Enter Table 20 at the flow depth of 0.2 ft (0.06 m), and project to the depth of depression
of the gutter of 4 in (102 mm). Opposite this depth, read the inlet capacity per foot of
length as 0.50 ft3/s (0.014 m3/s).

3. Compute the required gutter inlet length

The gutter must handle a maximum flow of 2 ft3/s (0.057 m3/s). Since the inlet has a ca-
pacity of 0.50 ftV(s-ft) [0.047 m3/(nrs)] of length, the required length, ft = maximum re-
quired capacity, ft3/s/capacity per foot, ft3/s - 2.0/0.50 = 4.0 ft (1.2 m). A length of 4.0 ft
(1.2 m) will be satisfactory. Were a length of 4.2 or 4.4 ft (1.28 or 1.34 m) required, a
4.5-ft (1.37-m) long inlet would be chosen. The reasoning behind the choice of a longer
length is that the extra initial investment for the longer length is small compared with the
extra capacity obtained.

4. Determine how far the water will extend from the curb

Use the relation / = rd, where / = distance water will extend from the curb, ft; d = depth of
water in the gutter at the curb line, ft; other symbols as before. Substituting, we find / =
48(0.2) = 9.6 ft (2.9 m). This distance is acceptable because the water would extend out
this far only during the heaviest storms.
Related Calculations. To compute the flow rate in a gutter, use the relation F =
Q.56(r/n)s°-5dm, where F = flow rate in gutter, ft3/s; n = roughness coefficient, usually

taken as 0.015; s = gutter slope, in/ft; other symbols as before. Where the computed inlet
length is 5 ft (1.5 m) or more, some engineers assume that a portion of the water will pass
the first inlet and enter the next one along the street.

STORM-SEWER DESIGN

Design a storm-sewer system for a 30-acre (1.21 * 105-m2) residential area in which the
storm-water runoff rate is computed to be 24 ft3/s (0.7 m3/s). The total area is divided into
10 plots of equal area having similar soil and runoff conditions.

Calculation Procedure:
1. Sketch a plan of the sewer system

Sketch the area and the 10 plots as in Fig. 15. A scale of 1 in = 100 ft (1 cm = 12 m) is
generally suitable. Indicate the terrain elevations by drawing the profile curves on the plot
plan. Since the profiles (Fig. 15) show that the terrain slopes from north to south, the main
sewer can probably be best run from north to south. The sewer would also slope down-
ward from north to south, following the general slope of the terrain.
Indicate a storm-water inlet for each of the areas served by the sewer. With the terrain
sloping from north to south, each inlet will probably give best service if it is located on
the southern border of the plot.
Since the plots are equal in area, the main sewer can be run down the center of the plot
with each inlet feeding into it. Use arrows to indicate the flow direction in the laterals and
main sewer.

2. Compute the lateral sewer size

Each lateral sewer handles 24 ft3/s/10 plots = 2.4 fWs (0.07 m3/s) of storm water. Size
each lateral, using the Manning formula with n = 0.013 and full flow in the pipe. Assume
a slope ratio of 0.05 for each inlet pipe between the inlet and the main sewer. This means

FIGURE 15. Typical storm-sewer plot plan and layout diagram.

that the inlet pipe will slope 1 ft in 20 ft (0.3 m in 6.1 m) of length. In an installation such
as this, a slope ratio of 0.05 is adequate.
By using Fig. 12 for a flow of 2.4 ft3/s (0.0679 m3/s) and a slope of 0.05, an 8-in (203-
mm) pipe is required for each lateral. The fluid velocity is, from Fig. 12, 7.45 ft/s (2.27
m/s). This is a high enough velocity to prevent solids from settling out of the water. [The
flow velocity should not be less than 2 ft/s (0.61 m/s).]
3. Compute the size of the main sewer
There are four sections of the main sewer (Fig. 15). The first section, section 3-4, serves
the two northernmost plots. Since the flow from each plot is 2.4 ft3/s (0.0679 m3/s), the
storm water that this portion of the main sewer must handle is 2(2.4) = 4.8 fWs (0.14
m3/s).
The main sewer begins at point A9 which has an elevation of about 213 ft (64.9 m), as
shown by the profile. At point B the terrain elevation is about 190 ft (57.8 m). Hence, the
slope between points A and B is about 213 - 190 = 23 ft (7.0 m), and the distance between
the two points is about 920 ft (280.4 m).
Assume a slope of 1 ft/100 ft (0.3 m/30.5 m) of length, or 1/100 = 0.01 for the main
sewer. This is a typical slope used for main sewers, and it is within the range permitted by
a pipe run along the surface of this terrain. Table 21 shows the minimum slope required to
produce a flow velocity of 2 ft/s (0.61 m/s).
Using Fig. 12 for a flow of 4.8 ft3/s (0.14 m3/s) and a slope of 0.01, we see the required
size for section 3-4 of the main sewer is 15 in (381 mm). The flow velocity in the pipe is
4.88 ft/s (1.49 m/s). The size of this sewer is in keeping with general design practice,
which seldom uses a storm sewer less than 12 in (304.8 mm) in diameter.
Section 5-6 conveys 9.6 fWs (0.27 mVs). Using Fig. 12 again, we find the required

pipe size is 18 in (457.2 mm) and the flow velocity is 5.75 ft/s (1.75 m/s). Likewise, sec-
tion 7-8 must handle 14.4 ft3/s (0.41 mVs). The required pipe size is 21 in (533 mm), and
the flow velocity in the pipe is 6.35 ft/s (1.94 m/s). Section 9-10 of the main sewer han-
dles 19.2 ft3/s (0.54 m3/s), and must be 24 in (609.6 mm) in diameter. The velocity in this
section of the sewer pipe will be 6.9 ft/s (2.1 m/s). The last section of the main sewer han-
dles the total flow, or 24 fWs (0.7 m3/s). Its size must be 27 in (686 mm), Fig. 12, al-
though a 24-in (610.0-mm) pipe would suffice if the slope at point B could be increased to
0.012.
Related Calculations. Most new sewers built today are the separate type, i.e.,
one sewer for sanitary service and another sewer for storm service. Sanitary sewers are
usually installed first because they are generally smaller than storm sewers and cost less.
Combined sewers handle both sanitary and storm flows and are used where expensive ex-
cavation for underground sewers is necessary. Many older cities have combined sewers.
To size a combined sewer, compute the sum of the maximum sanitary and stormwater
flow for each section of the sewer. Then use the method given in this procedure after hav-
ing assumed a value for n in the Manning formula and for the slope of the sewer main.
Where a continuous slope cannot be provided for a sewer main, a pumping station to
lift the sewage must be installed. Most cities require one or more pumping stations be-
cause the terrain does not permit an unrestricted slope for the sewer mains. Motor-driven
centrifugal pumps are generally used to handle sewage. For unscreened sewage, the suc-
tion inlet of the pump should not be less than 3 in (76 mm) in diameter.

DESIGN OFA COMPLETE-MIX ACTIVATED
SLUDGE REACTOR

Domestic wastewater with an average daily flow of 4.0 Mgd (15,140 m3/d) has a five day
Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD5) of 240 mg/L after primary settling. The effluent is
to have a BOD5 of 10 mg/L or less. Design a complete-mix activated sludge reactor to
treat the wastewater including reactor volume, hydraulic retention time, quantity of
sludge wasted, oxygen requirements, food to microorganism ratio, volumetric loading,
and WAS and RAS requirements.

Calculation Procedure:

1. Compute the reactor volume

The volume of the reactor can be determined using the following equation derived from
Monod kinetics:

OcQY(S0-S
r A", ( 1 +AA)
where Vr = Reactor volume (Mgal) (m3)
S0 = Mean cell residence time, or the average time that the sludge remains in the
reactor (sludge age). For a complete-mix activated sludge process, 6C ranges
from 5 to 15 days. The design of the reactor is based on S0 on the assumption
that substantially all the substrate (BOD) conversion occurs in the reactor, A
S0 of 8 days will be assumed.
Q = Average daily influent flow rate (Mgd) = 4.0 Mgd (15,140 m3/d)
Y= Maximum yield coefficient (mg VSS/mg BOD5). For the activated sludge
process for domestic wastewater Y ranges from 0.4 to 0.8. A Y of 0.6 mg
VSS/mg BOD5 will be assumed. Essentially, Y represents the maximum mg
of cells produced per mg organic matter removed.
S0 = Influent substrate (BOD5) concentration (mg/L) = 240 mg/L
S= Effluent substrate (BOD5) concentration (mg/L) = 10 mg/L
X0 = Concentration of microorganisms in reactor = Mixed Liquor Volatile Sus-
pended Solids (MLVSS) in mg/L. It is generally accepted that the ratio
MLVSS/MLSS ~ 0.8, where MLSS is the Mixed Liquor Suspended Solids
concentration in the reactor. MLSS represents the sum of volatile suspended
solids (organics) and fixed suspended solids (inorganics). For a complete-mix
activated sludge process, MLSS ranges from 1,000 to 6,500 mg/L. An MLSS
of 4,500 mg/L will be assumed. = > MLVSS = (0.8)(4500 mg/L) = 3600
mg/L.
kd = Endogenous decay coefficient (d~l) which is a coefficient representing the
decrease of cell mass in the MLVSS. For the activated sludge process for do-
mestic wastewater kd ranges from 0.025 to 0.075 d~l. A value of 0.06 d~l will
be assumed.

Therefore:

(8 <Q(4.0 Mgd)(0.6 mg VSS/mg BOD5)(240 - 10)mg/L
Vr~~ 
(3600mg/L)(l + (0.06 d~l) (8 </))

= 0.83 Mgal (110,955 ft3) (3140 m3)

2. Compute the hydraulic retention time

The hydraulic retention time (6) in the reactor is the reactor volume divided by the influ-
ent flow rate: VrIQ. Therefore, B = (0.83 Mgal)/(4.0 Mgd) = 0.208 days = 5.0 hours. For a
complete-mix activated sludge process, 6 is generally 3-5 hours. Therefore, the hydraulic
retention time is acceptable.

3. Compute the quantity of sludge wasted

The observed cell yield, 7obs = 7/1 + kdSc = 0.6/(1 + (0.06 d~l)($ d)) = 0.41 mg/mg repre-
sents the actual cell yield that would be observed. The observed cell yield is always less
than the maximum cell yield (Y).

The increase in MLVSS is computed using the following equation:

P* = Y0bsQ(So - S)(8-34 Ib/Mgal/mg/L)

where Px is the net waste activated sludge produced each day in (Ib VSS/d).
Using values defined above:

f* = (°-41 J2IS <4'0 M^ (24° ^ - 1° 1T-Y«-34 ^T)

a value of (2)(6816 Ib O2AI) - 13,632 Ib O2/d (6188.9 kg O2/d) is used.

5. Compute the food to microorganism ratio (F:M)
and the volumetric loading (VJ

In order to maintain control over the activated sludge process, two commonly used pa-
rameters are (1) the food to microorganism ratio (F :M) and, (2) the mean cell residence
time (0C). The mean cell residence time was assumed in Part 1 "Compute Reactor Vol-
ume" to be 8 days.
The food to microorganism ratio is defined as:

?:M = S0OXa

where F:M is the food to microorganism ratio in d~l.
F:M is simply a ratio of the "food" or BOD5 of the incoming waste, to the concentra-
tion of "microorganisms" in the aeration tank or MLVSS. Therefore, using values defined
previously:

F:M = (0.208 d)(3600 mg/L) = °'321 d '

Typical values for F:M reported in literature vary from 0.05 d~l to 1.0 d~l depending
on the type of treatment process used.
A low value of F:M can result in the growth of filamentous organisms and is the most
common operational problem in the activated sludge process. A proliferation of filamen-
tous organisms in the mixed liquor results in a poorly settling sludge, commonly referred
to as "bulking sludge."
One method of controlling the growth of filamentous organisms is through the use of a
separate compartment as the initial contact zone of a biological reactor where primary ef-
fluent and return activated sludge are combined. This concept provides a high F:M at con-
trolled oxygen levels which provides selective growth of floe forming organisms at the
initial stage of the biological process. An F:M ratio of at least 2.27 d~l in this compart-
ment is suggested in the literature. However, initial F:M ratios ranging from 20-25 d~l
have also been reported.
The volumetric (organic) loading (V1) is defined as:

VL = S0QW, = S0/O

V1 is a measure of the pounds OfBOD5 applied daily per thousand cubic feet of aera-
tion tank volume. Using values defined previously:

VL = (240 mg/L)/(0.208 d) = 1154 mg/L-d = 72 Ib/103ft3-d (1.15 kg/Mm3-d)

Volumetric loading can vary from 20 to more than 200 Ib/103ft3-d (0.32 to 3.2
kg/Mm3•</), and may be used as an alternate (although crude) method of sizing aeration
tanks.

6. Compute the waste activated sludge (WAS) and return activated
sludge (RAS) requirements

Control of the activated sludge process is important to maintain high levels of treatment
performance under a wide range of operating conditions. The principle factors used in
process control are (1) maintaining dissolved-oxygen levels in the aeration tanks, (2) reg-
ulating the amount of Return Activated Sludge (RAS), and (3) controlling the Waste Ac-

tivated Sludge (WAS). As outlined previously in Part 5 "Compute the Food to Microor-
ganism Ratio and the Volumetric Loading," the most commonly used parameters for con-
trolling the activated sludge process are the F:M ratio and the mean cell residence time
(0C). The Mixed Liquor Volatile Suspended Solids (MLVSS) concentration may also be
used as a control parameter. Return Activated Sludge (RAS) is important in maintaining
the MLVSS concentration and the Waste Activated Sludge (WAS) is important in con-
trolling the mean cell residence time (0C).
The excess waste activated sludge produced each day (see step 3 "Compute the Quan-
tity of Sludge Wasted") is wasted from the system to maintain a given F:M or mean cell
residence time. Generally, sludge is wasted from the return sludge line because it is more
concentrated than the mixed liquor in the aeration tank, hence smaller waste sludge
pumps are required. The waste sludge is generally discharged to sludge thickening and di-
gestion facilities. The alternative method of sludge wasting is to withdraw mixed liquor
directly from the aeration tank where the concentration of solids is uniform. Both meth-
ods of calculating the waste sludge flow rate are illustrated below.
Use Figs. 1 and 2 when performing mass balances for the determination of RAS and
WAS.

X= Mixed Liquor Suspended Solids (MLSS)—see Part 1 "Compute the Reactor
Volume."
Qr = Return activated sludge pumping rate (Mgd)
Xr = Concentration of sludge in the return line (mg/L). When lacking site specific op-
erational data, a value commonly assumed is 8000 mg/L.
Q6 = Effluent flow rate (Mgd)
Xe = Concentration of solids in effluent (mg/L). When lacking site specific opera-
tional data, this value is commonly assumed to be zero.
Qw = Wasted Activated Sludge (WAS) pumping rate from the reactor (Mgd)
Qw> = Waste Activated Sludge (WAS) pumping rate from the return line (Mgd)

Other variables are as defined previously.
The actual amount of liquid that must be pumped to achieve process control depends
on the method used and the location from which the wasting is to be accomplished. Also
note that because the solids capture of the sludge processing facilities (i.e., thickeners, di-

gesters, etc.) is not 100 percent and some solids are returned, the actual wasting rate will
be higher than the theoretically determined value.
(a) Waste Activated Sludge (WAS) pumping rate from the return line. If the mean cell
residence time is used for process control and the wasting is from the sludge return line
(Fig. 1), the wasting rate is computed using the following:

(QW'*r +QeXe)

Assuming that the concentration of solids in the effluent from the settling tank (Xe) is
low, then the above equation reduces to:

°c~ Qw,xr

_ vrx

Qw> = ~e^xr

Using values defined previously:

*< - TSffST -""H*-*—-*"" -*>

To determine the WAS pumping rate using this method, the solids concentration in
both the aeration tank and the return line must be known.
If the food to microorganism ratio (F :M) method of control is used, the WAS
pumping rate from the return line is determined using the following:

P*& = 2^(8.34 Ib/Mgal/mg/L)

Therefore:

C" = (80009m^(d8.34) = °'059 M^ = 59'°

°0 ^(223'3 rf/«

In this case, the concentration of solids in the sludge return line must be known. Note
that regardless of the method used for calculation, if wasting occurs from the return line,
the WAS pumping rate is approximately the same.

(b) Waste Activated Sludge (WAS) pumping rate from the aeration tank. If the mean
cell residence time is used for process control, wasting is from the aeration tank (Fig. 2),
and the solids in the plant effluent (Xe) are again neglected, then the WAS pumping rate is
estimated using the following:

Using values defined previously:

Qw = °'833^gal = 0.104 Mgd = 104,000 gal/day (393.6 m3/d)
8 d

Note that in case (a) or (b) above, the weight of sludge wasted is the same (3933 Ib SS/d)
(1785.6 kg SS/d), and that either wasting method will achieve a Oc of 8 days. As can be
seen, wasting from the aeration tank produces a much higher waste flow rate. This is be-
cause the concentration of solids in the bottom of the settling tank (and hence the return
line) is higher than in the aeration tank. Consequently, wasting a given mass of solids per
day is going to require a larger WAS pumping rate (and larger WAS pumps) if done from
the aeration tank as opposed to the return line. The Return Activated Sludge (RAS) pump-
ing rate is determined by performing a mass balance analysis around either the settling
tank or the aeration tank. The appropriate control volume for either mass balance analysis
is illustrated in Figs. 1 and 2, respectively. Assuming that the sludge blanket level in the
settling tank remains constant and that the solids in the effluent from the settling tank (Xe)
are negligible, a mass balance around the settling tank (Fig. 1) yields the following equa-
tion for RAS pumping rate:

= XQ-X&*

Using values defined previously, the RAS pumping rate is computed to be

®r ~ 
8000 mg/L - 4500 mg/L

= 5.0 Mgd (18,925 m3/d)

As outlined above, the required RAS pumping rate can also be estimated by perform-
ing a mass balance around the aeration tank (Fig. 2). If new cell growth is considered neg-
ligible, then the solids entering the tank will equal the solids leaving the tank. Under con-
ditions such as high organic loadings, this assumption may be incorrect. Solids enter the
aeration tank in the return sludge and in the influent flow to the secondary process. How-
ever, because the influent solids are negligible compared to the MLSS in the return
sludge, the mass balance around the aeration tank yields the following equation for RAS
pumping rate:

Using values defined previously, the RAS pumping rate is computed to be

The ratio of RAS pumping rate to influent flow rate, or recirculation ratio (a), may now
be calculated:

Qr

Recirculation ratio can vary from 0.25 to 1.50 depending upon the type of activated
sludge process used. Common design practice is to size the RAS pumps so that they are
capable of providing a recirculation ratio ranging from 0.50 to 1.50.
It should be noted that if the control volume were placed around the aeration tank in
Fig. 1 and a mass balance performed, or the control volume placed around the settling
tank in Fig. 2 and a mass balance performed, that a slightly higher RAS pumping rate
would result. However, the difference between these RAS pumping rates and the ones
calculated above is negligible.

DESIGN OFA CIRCULAR SETTLING TANK

Domestic wastewater with an average daily flow of 4.0 Mgd (15,140 m3/d) exits the aera-
tion tank of a standard activated sludge treatment process. Design a circular settling tank
to separate the sludge from the effluent. The settling tank will work in conjunction with
the aeration tank. Assume a peaking factor of 2.5.

Calculation Procedure:

1. Determine the peak flow

Conventional examples of circular settling tank design utilize settling tests to size the
tanks. However, it is more common that settling facilities must be designed without the
benefit settling tests. When this situation develops, published values of surface loading
and solids loading rates are generally used. Because of the large amount of solids that
may be lost in the effluent if design criteria are exceeded, surface loading rates should be
based on peak flow conditions. Using a peaking factor of 2.5, the daily peak flow (Qp) is:

Qp = 2.5 x 4.0 Mgd = 10.0 Mgd (37,850 m3/d^

2. Find the settling tank surface area using surface loading criteria

The recommended surface loading rates (settling tank effluent flow divided by settling
tank area) vary depending upon the type of activated sludge process used. However, sur-
face loading rates ranging from 200 to 800 gal/day/ft2 (8.09 to 32.4 L/m2-d) for average
flow, and a maximum of 1,000 gal/day/ft2 (40.7 L/m2-d) for peak flow are accepted de-
sign values.
The recommended solids loading rate on an activated sludge settling tank also varies
depending upon the type of activated sludge process used and may be computed by divid-
ing the total solids applied by the surface area of the tank. The preferred units are Ib/ft2-h
(kg/m2-h). In effect, the solids loading rate represents a characteristic value for the sus-
pension under consideration. In a settling tank of fixed area, the effluent quality will dete-

riorate if solids loading is increased beyond the characteristic value for the suspension.
Without extensive experimental work covering all seasons and operating variables, high-
er rates should not be used for design. The recommended solids loading rates vary de-
pending upon the type of activated sludge process selected. However, solids loading rates
ranging from 0.8 to 1.2 Ib/ft2-h (3.9 to 5.86 kg/m2-h) for average flow, and 2.0 Ib/ft2-h
(9.77 kg/m2-h) for peak flow are accepted design values.
For a Qp of 10.0 Mgd and a design surface loading rate of 1,000 gal/day/ft2 at peak
flow, the surface area (A) of a settling tank may be calculated:

0 
1000 gal/day/ft2 =

1 Ox 106 gal/day

Solids (Ib/d) = (4.0 Mgd + 5.0 Mgd)(4,500 mg/L) (8.34 Ib L/mg-Mgal)
= 337,770 Ib/d = 14,074 Ib/h (6389.6 kg/h)

Therefore, the solids loading on the settling tanks at design flow is:

Solids Loading = l*?™^ «1.18 Ib/ft2-h (5.77 kg/m2-h)
11,889 ft

which is within the solids loading rate design criteria stated above.
Related Calculations. Liquid depth in a circular settling tank is normally meas-
ured at the side wall. This is called the sidewater depth. The liquid depth is a factor in the
effectiveness of suspended solids removal and in the concentration of the return sludge.
Current design practice favors a minimum sidewater depth of 12 ft (3.66 m) for large cir-
cular settling tanks. However, depths of up to 20 ft (6.1 m) have been used. The advan-
tages of deeper tanks include greater flexibility in operation and a larger margin of safety
when changes in the activated sludge system occur.

THICKENING OFA WASTE-ACTIVATED
SLUDGE USING A GRA VITY BELT
THICKENER

A wastewater treatment facility produces 58,000 gal/day (219.5 m3/d) of waste activated
sludge containing 0.8 percent solids (8,000 mg/L). Design a gravity belt thickener instal-
lation to thicken sludge to 5.0 percent solids based on a normal operation of 6 h/d and 5
d/wk. Use a gravity belt thickener loading rate of 1,000 Ib/h (454 kg/h) per meter of belt
width. Calculate the number and size of gravity belt thickeners required, the volume of
thickened sludge cake, and the solids capture in percent.

Calculation Procedure:

1. Find the dry mass of sludge that must be processed

Gravity belt thickening consists of a gravity belt that moves over rollers driven by a vari-
able speed drive unit. The waste activated sludge is usually pumped from the bottom of a
secondary settling tank, conditioned with polymer and fed into a feed/distribution box at
one end. The box is used to distribute the sludge evenly across the width of the moving
belt. The water drains through the belt as the sludge is carried toward the discharge end of
the thickener. The sludge is ridged and furrowed by a series of plow blades placed along
the travel of the belt, allowing the water released from the sludge to pass through the belt.
After the thickened sludge is removed, the belt travels through a wash cycle.
The 58,000 gal/day (219.5 m3/d) of waste activated sludge contains approximately
3933 Ib/d (1785.6 kg/d) of dry solids: See Design of a Complete-Mix Activated Sludge
Reactor, step 3—"Compute the Quantity of Sludge Wasted," and step 6—"Compute the
WAS and RAS Requirements."
Based on an operating schedule of 5 days per week and 6 hours per day, the dry mass
of sludge that must be processed is:

Weekly Rate: (3,933 lb/d)(7 d/wk) = 27,531 Ib/wk (12,499 kg/wk)

Daily Rate: (27,531 lb/wk)/(5 d/wk) = 5506 Ib/d (2499.7 kg/d)
Hourly Rate: (5506 lb/d)/(6 h/d) = 918 Ib/h (416.8 kg/h)

2. Size the belt thickener

Using the hourly rate of sludge calculated above, and a loading rate of 1,000 Ib/h per me-
ter of belt width, the size of the belt thickener is:

Belt Width = 918I^ = 0.918 m (3.01 ft)
1000 Ib/h-m 
v 
'

Use one belt thickener with a 1.0 m belt width. Note that one identical belt thickener
should be provided as a spare.
The thickened sludge flow rate (S) in gal/day (m3/d) and the filtrate flow rate (F) in
gal/day (m3/d) are computed by developing solids balance and flow balance equations:
(a) Solids balance equation. Solids in = solids out, which implies that: solids in sludge
feed = solids in thickened sludge + solids in filtrate. Assume the following:

• Sludge feed specific gravity (s.g.) =1 .01
• Thickened sludge s.g. = 1.03
• Filtrate s.g. = 1.0
• Suspended solids in filtrate = 900 mg/L = 0.09%

Therefore, the solids balance equation on a daily basis becomes:

5506 Ib = (S9 gal/day)(8.34 lb/gal)(1.03)(0.05)
+ (F, gal/day)(8.34 lb/gal)(l .O)(0.0009) 
5506 Ib/d - 0.4295(5) + 0.0075(F)

(1)

(b) Flow balance equation. Flow in = flow out, which implies that: influent sludge
flow rate + washwater flow rate = thickened sludge flow rate + filtrate flow rate. Daily in-
fluent sludge flow rate = (58,000 gal/day)(7/5) - 81,200 gal/day (307.3 m3/d).

3. Compute the thickened sludge and filtrate flow rates

Washwater flow rate is assumed to be 16 gal/min (1.0 L/s). Washwater flow rate varies
from 12 gal/min (0.757 L/s) to 30 gal/min (1.89 L/s) depending on belt thickener size.
Therefore, with an operating schedule of 6 h/d (360 min/d) the flow balance equation on a
daily basis becomes:

81,200 gal/day + (16 gal/min)(360 min/d) - S + F
86,960 gal/day = S + F 

(2)

Putting (Eq. 1) and (Eq. 2) in matrix format, and solving for thickened sludge flow rate
(S) and filtrate flow rate (F):

[" 0.4295 0.0075 ] [" S]

S = 11,502 gal/day (43.5 m3/d) of thickened sludge at 5.0% solids

F= 75,458 gal/day (285.6 m3/d) of filtrate

Therefore, the volume of thickened waste activated sludge exiting the gravity belt thick-
ener is 11,502 gal/day (43.5 m3/d) at 5.0 percent solids.

Calculation Procedure:

1. Find the daily volume of sludge for disposal

Factors that must be considered in designing aerobic digesters include temperature, solids
reduction, tank volume (hydraulic retention time), oxygen requirements and energy re-
quirements for mixing.
Because the majority of aerobic digesters are open tanks, digester liquid temperatures
are dependent upon weather conditions and can fluctuate extensively. As with all biologi-
cal systems, lower temperatures retard the process, whereas higher temperatures acceler-
ate it. The design of the aerobic digester should provide the necessary degree of sludge
stabilization at the lowest liquid operating temperature and should supply the maximum
oxygen requirements at the maximum liquid operating temperature.
A major objective of aerobic digestion is to reduce the mass of the solids for disposal.
This reduction is assumed to take place only with the biodegradable content (VSS) of the
sludge, although there may be some destruction of the inorganics as well. Typical reduc-
tion in VSS ranges from 40 to 50 percent. Solids destruction is primarily a direct function
of both basin liquid temperature and sludge age, as indicated in Fig. 3. The plot relates
VSS reduction to degree-days (temperature x sludge age).
To ensure proper operation, the contents of the aerobic digester should be well mixed.
In general, because of the large amount of air that must be supplied to meet the oxygen re-
quirement, adequate mixing is usually achieved. However, mixing power requirements
should always be checked.
The aerobic digester will operate 7 days per week, unlike the thickening facilities
which operate intermittently due to larger operator attention requirements. The thickened
sludge is input to the digester at 12,823 gal/day (48.5 L/d), 5 days per week. However, the
volume of the sludge to be disposed of daily by the digester will be lower due to its oper-
ation 7 days per week (the "bugs" do not take the weekends off). Therefore the volume of
sludge to be disposed of daily (0 is:

Qt = (12,823 gal/day)(5/7) = 9,159 gal/day = 1,224 ftVd (34.6 m3/d)

2. Determine the required VSS reduction

The sludge age required for winter conditions is obtained from Fig. 3 using the minimum
winter temperature and required VSS reduction.
To achieve a 40 percent VSS reduction in the winter, the degree-days required from
Fig. 3 is 4750Gd. Therefore, the required sludge age is 475°Gd/15°C = 31.7 days. During
the summer, when the liquid temperature is 3O0C, the degree-days required is (3O0C)
(31.7 d) = 9510Gd. From Fig. 3, the VSS reduction will be 46 percent.
The total mass of solids processed by the digester will be 3,933 Ib/d (1785.6 kg/d)
which is the total mass of solids wasted from the treatment facility—See Design of a
Complete-Mix Activated Sludge Reactor, step 3. The total mass of VSS input to the di-
gester is:

(0.8)(3,933 Ib/d) = 3146 Ib/d (1428.3 kg/d).

Therefore, during the winter:

• VSS reduction = (3,146 lb/d)(0.40) = 1258 Ib VSS reduced/d (571.1 kg/d)
• Digested (stabilized) sludge leaving the digester = 3933 Ib/d - 1258 Ib/d = 2675 Ib/d
(1214.5 kg/d).

3. Compute the volume of digested sludge

The volume of digested sludge is:

V= 
^
(p)(s.g.X% solids)

where V= Sludge volume (ft3) (m3)
W8 = Weight of sludge (Ib) (kg)
p = density of water (62.4 lb/ft3) (994.6 kg/m3)
s.g. = specific gravity of digested sludge (assume s.g. = 1.03)
% solids = percent solids expressed as a decimal (incoming sludge: 5.0%)

Therefore, the volume of the digested sludge is:

V= (62.41b/6

ft3)(5T3)(0.05) =832 f t3 /d = 6223gal/day(23.6L/d)

During the summer:

• VSS reduction = (3,146 lb/d)(0.46) = 1447 Ib VSS reduced/d (656.9 kg/d)
• Digested (stabilized) sludge leaving the digester = 3933 Ib/d - 1447 Ib/d = 2486 Ib/d
(1128.6 kg/d).
• Volume of digested sludge:

V = (62.41b2/4

ft3)6(i^)(0.05) - ?74 ftVd - 579° 8^(2L9 L/d)

4. Find the oxygen and air requirements

The oxygen required to destroy the VSS is approximately 2.3 Ib O2/lb VSS (kg/kg) de-
stroyed. Therefore, the oxygen requirements for winter conditions are:

(1258 Ib VSS/d)(2.3 Ib O2Ab VSS) = 2893 Ib O2/d (1313.4 kg/d)

The volume of air required at standard conditions (14.7 lb/in2 and 680F) (96.5 kPa and
2O0C) assuming air contains 23.2 percent oxygen by weight and the density of air is 0.075
Ib /f t3is:

V°lume°f Ak - (0.0758Ib^32) - 166'264ft3/d(47°53 m3/d)

For summer conditions:

• Oxygen required = (1447 lb/d)(2.3 Ib O2/d) = 3328 Ib O2/d (1510.9 kg/d)
• Volume of Air = 3328 Ib O2/d/(0.075 Ib/ft3)(0.232) = 191,264 ft3/d (5412.8 m3/d)

Note that the oxygen transfer efficiency of the digester system must be taken into ac-
count to get the actual volume of air required. Assuming diffused aeration with an oxygen
transfer efficiency of 10 percent, the actual air requirements at standard conditions are:

• Winter: volume of air = 166,264 ft3/d/(0.1)(1,400 min/d) = 1155 ftVmin (32.7 nWmin)
• Summer: volume of air = 191,264 ft3/d/(0.1)(1,440 min/d) = 1328 fVVmin (37.6

5. Determine the aerobic digester volume

From the above analysis it is clear that the aerobic digester volume will be calculated us-
ing values obtained under the winter conditions analysis, while the aeration equipment
will be sized using the 1328 ft3/min (37.6 m3/min) air requirement obtained under the
summer conditions analysis.
The volume of the aerobic digester is computed using the following equation, assum-
ing the digester is loaded with waste activated sludge only:

where V = Volume of aerobic digester, ft3 (m3)
Qi = Influent average flow rate to the digester, fWd (m3/d)
X1 = Influent suspended solids, mg/L (50,000 mg/L for 5.0% solids)

X= Digester total suspended solids, mg/L
Kj= Reaction rate constant, d~l. May range from 0.05 d~l at 150C (590F) to 0.14
d~l at 250C (770F) (assume 0.06 d~l at 150C)
Pv = Volatile fraction of digester suspended solids (expressed as a decimal) = 0.8
(80%) as stated in the initial assumptions.
Qc = Solids retention time (sludge age), d

Using values obtained above with winter conditions governing, the aerobic digester vol-
ume is:

V= 

(1,224 rV/d)(50,OOOmg/L)

The air requirement per 1,000 ft3 (2.8 m3) of digester volume with summer conditions
governing is:

Volume of Air = 1328 ft /inm
 = 59.41 ft3/min/103ft3 (0.97 m3/min/Mm3)
21.7o2 10 it

The mixing requirements for diffused aeration range from 20 to 40 ft3/min/103ft3 (0.32 to
0.64 m3/min/Mm3). Therefore, adequate mixing will prevail.

DESIGN OF AN AERATED GRIT CHAMBER

Domestic wastewater enters a wastewater treatment facility with an average daily flow
rate of 4.0 Mgd (15,140 L/d). Assuming a peaking factor of 2.5, size an aerated grit cham-
ber for this facility including chamber volume, chamber dimensions, air requirement, and
grit quantity.

Calculation Procedure:

1. Determine the aerated grit chamber volume

Grit removal in a wastewater treatment facility prevents unnecessary abrasion and wear
of mechanical equipment such as pumps and scrappers, and grit deposition in pipelines
and channels. Grit chambers are designed to remove grit (generally characterized as non-
putrescible solids) consisting of sand, gravel, or other heavy solid materials that have set-
tling velocities greater than those of the organic putrescible solids in the wastewater.
In aerated grit chamber systems, air introduced along one side near the bottom causes
a spiral roll velocity pattern perpendicular to the flow through the tank. The heavier parti-
cles with their correspondingly higher settling velocities drop to the bottom, while the
rolling action suspends the lighter organic particles, which are carried out of the tank. The
rolling action induced by the air diffusers is independent of the flow through the tank.
Then non flow dependent rolling action allows the aerated grit chamber to operate effec-
tively over a wide range of flows. The heavier particles that settle on the bottom of the
tank are moved by the spiral flow of the water across the tank bottom and into a grit hop-
per. Screw augers or air lift pumps are generally utilized to remove the grit from the hop-
per.
The velocity of roll governs the size of the particles of a given specific gravity that

will be removed. If the velocity is too great, grit will be carried out of the chamber. If the
velocity is too small, organic material will be removed with the grit. The quantity of air is
easily adjusted by throttling the air discharge or using adjustable speed drives on the
blowers. With proper adjustment, almost 100 percent grit removal will be obtained, and
the grit will be well washed. Grit that is not well washed will contain organic matter and
become a nuisance through odor emission and the attraction of insects.
Wastewater will move through the aerated grit chamber in a spiral path as illustrated
in Fig. 4. The rolling action will make two to three passes across the bottom of the tank at
maximum flow and more at lesser flows. Wastewater is introduced in the direction of the
roll.
At peak flow rate, the detention time in the aerated grit chamber should range from 2
to 5 minutes. A detention time of 3 minutes will be used for this example. Because it is
necessary to drain the chamber periodically for routine maintenance, two redundant
chambers will be required. Therefore, the volume of each chamber is:

ft3 _ (peak flow rate, gal/day)(detention time, min)
(7.48 gal/ft3)(24 h/d)(60 min/h)

(7.48 gal/ft3)(24 h/d)(60min/h)

2. Determine the dimensions of the grit chamber

Width-depth ratio for aerated grit chambers range from 1:1 to 5:1. Depths range from 7 to
16 feet (2.1 to 4.87 m). Using a width-depth ratio of 1.2:1 and a depth of 8 feet (2.43 m),
the dimensions of the aerated grit chamber are:

Width = (1.2)(8 ft) = 9.6 ft (2.92 m)

Length = (volume)/[(width)(depth)] = Q ™9^ft) = 36.3 ft (11.1 m)

Length-width ratios range from 3:1 to 5:1. As a check, length to width ratio for the aerat-
ed grit chamber sized above is: 36.3 ft/9.6 ft = 3.78:1 which is acceptable.

3. Determine the air supply required

The air supply requirement for an aerated grit chamber ranges from 2.0 to 5.0 ft3/mm/'ft of
chamber length (0.185 to 0.46 m3/min-m). Using 5.0 fWmin/ft (0.46 mVmin-m) for de-
sign, the amount of air required is:

Air required (ftVmin) = (5.0 ft3/min/ft)(36.3 ft) = 182 fWmin (5.2 m3/min)

4. Estimate the quantity of grit expected

Grit quantities must be estimated to allow sizing of grit handling equipment such as grit
conveyors and grit dewatering equipment. Grit quantities from an aerated grit chamber
vary from 0.5 to 27 fWMgal (3.74 to 201.9 m3/L) of flow. Assume a value of 20 fWMgal
(149.5 m3/L). Therefore, the average quantity of grit expected is:

Volume of grit (ft3/d) = (20 ft3/Mgal)(4.0 Mgd) = 80 ft3/d (2.26 m3/d)

Some advantages and disadvantages of the aerated grit chamber are listed below:

Advantages

Disadvantages

The same efficiency of grit removal is
possible over a wide flow range.
Head loss through the grit chamber is
minimal,

By controlling the rate of aeration, a grit
of relatively low putrescible organic
content can be removed,

Preaeration may alleviate septic conditions
in the incoming wastewater to improve
performance of downstream treatment
units.
Aerated grit chambers can also be used
for chemical addition, mixing,
preaeration, and flocculation ahead of
primary treatment.

Power consumption is higher than other
grit removal processes.
Additional labor is required for
maintenance and control of the aeration
system.
Significant quantities of potentially
harmful volatile organics and odors may
be released from wastewaters containing
these constituents.
Foaming problems may be created if
influent wastewater has surfactants
present.

DESIGN OF A SOLID-BOWL CENTRIFUGE
FOR SLUDGE DEWATERING

A 4.0 Mgd (15,140 m3/d) municipal wastewater treatment facility produces 6,230 gal/day
(23.6 m3/d) of aerobically digested sludge at 5.0 percent solids. Determine design param-
eters for the specification of a solid bowl centrifuge for dewatering the sludge including:
number of centrifuges, solids feed rate, percent solids recovery, dewatered sludge (cake)
discharge rate, centrifugal force, polymer dosage, and polymer feed rate. Assume the fol-
lowing apply:

• Feed sludge is aerobically digested at 5.0 percent solids.
• Dewatered sludge (cake) is to be 25 percent solids.
• Centrate assumed to be 0.3 percent solids.
• Polymer solution concentration is 25 percent.

Calculation Procedure:

1. Select the number of centrifuges

The separation of a liquid-solid sludge during centrifugal thickening is analogous to the
separation process in a gravity thickener. In a centrifuge, however, the applied force is
centrifugal rather than gravitational and usually exerts 1,500 to 3,500 times the force of
gravity. Separation results from the centrifugal force-driven migration of the suspended
solids through the suspending liquid, away from the axis of rotation. The increased set-
tling velocity imparted by the centrifugal force as well as the short settling distance of the
particles accounts for the comparatively high capacity of centrifugal equipment.
Centrifuges are commonly used for thickening or dewatering Waste Activated Sludge
(WAS) and other biological sludges from secondary wastewater treatment. In the process,
centrifuges reduce the volume of stabilized (digested) sludges to minimize the cost of ul-
timate disposal. Because centrifuge equipment is costly and sophisticated, centrifuges are
most commonly found in medium to large wastewater treatment facilities.
The capacity of sludge dewatering to be installed at a given facility is a function of the
size of a facility, capability to repair machinery on-site, and the availability of an alterna-
tive disposal means. Some general guidelines relating the minimal capacity requirements
are listed in Table 1. This table is based on the assumption that there is no alternative
mode of sludge disposal and that the capacity to store solids is limited.

(Design Manual for Dewatering Municipal Wastewater Sludges, U.S. EPA)

Using Table 1, the number of centrifuges recommended for a 4.0 Mgd (15,410 m3/d)
waste water treatment facility is one operational + one spare for a total of two centrifuges.

2. Find the sludge feed rate required

If the dewatering facility is operated 4 h/d, 7 d/wk, then the sludge feed rate is

Sludge Feed Rate - (6,230 gal/day)/[(4 h/d)(60/min/h)]
= 26 gal/min (1.64 L/s)

Although a 4 h/d operation is below that recommended in Table 1, the sludge feed rate
of 26 gal/min (1.64 L/s) is adequate for the size of centrifuge usually found at a treatment
facility of this capacity. A longer operational day would be necessary if the dewatering fa-
cilities were operated only 5 days per week, or during extended period of peak flow and
solids loading.
Assume a feed sludge specific gravity of 1.03. The sludge feed in Ib/h is calculated us-
ing the following equation:

w= W(p)(s.gQ(%solids)(60min/h)
7.48 gal/ft3

Ws = Weight flow rate of sludge feed, Ib/h (kg/h)
V = Volume flow rate of sludge feed, gal/min (L/s)
s.g. = specific gravity of sludge
% solids = percent solids expressed as a decimal
p = density of water, 62.4 Ib/ft3 (994.6 kg/m3)

Using values obtained above, the sludge feed in Ib/h is:

r 

Iy =

(26 gal/min)(62.4 Ib/ft3)(l .03)(0.05)(60 min/h)
7.48 gal/ft3

= 670 Ib/h of dry solids (304.2 kg/h)

3. Compute the solids capture

Since the solids exiting the centrifuge are split between the centrate and the cake, it is
necessary to use a recovery formula to determine solids capture. Recovery is the mass of
solids in the cake divided by the mass of solids in the feed. If the solids content of the
feed, centrate and cake are measured, it is possible to calculate percent recovery without
determining total mass of any of the streams. The equation for percent solids recovery is

/ C5

R = 100(25/5) ["(5 _°Q

3) 1 = 95.14%

4. Determine the Dewatered Sludge Cake Discharge Rate

The dewatered sludge (cake) discharge rate is calculated using the following:

Cake discharge rate (Ib/h) dry solids = (sludge feed rate, lb/h)(solids recovery)

= (670 lb/h)(0.95 14) = 637.5 Ib/h (289.4 kg/h) dry cake

The wet cake discharge in Ib/h is calculated using the following:

For a dewatering facility operation of 4 h/d, the volume of dewatered sludge cake to be
disposed of per day is:

(42.5 ft3/h)(4 h/d) = 170 fWd = 1272 gal/day (4.81 L/d)

5. Find the percent reduction in sludge volume

The percent reduction in sludge volume is then calculated using the following:

Centrifuges operate at speed ranges which develop centrifugal forces from 1,500 to
3,500 times the force of gravity. In practice, it has been found that higher rotational
speeds usually provide significant improvements in terms of performance, particularly on
wastewater sludges.
In most cases, a compromise is made between the process requirement and O&M

considerations. Operating at higher speeds helps achieve optimum performance which is
weighed against somewhat greater operating and maintenance costs. Increasing bowl
speed usually increases solids recovery and cake dryness. Today most centrifuges used in
wastewater applications can provide good clarity and solids concentration at G levels be-
tween 1,800 and 2,500 times the force of gravity.

6. Compute the centrifugal force in the centrifuge

The centrifugal acceleration force (G), defined as multiples of gravity, is a function of the
rotational speed of the bowl and the distance of the particle from the axis of rotation. In
the centrifuge, the centrifugal force, G, is calculated as follows:

(2TrN)2R

32.2 ft/s2

where TV= Rotational speed of centrifuge (rev/s)
R = Bowl radius, ft (cm)

The rotational speed and bowl diameter of the centrifuge will vary depending upon the
manufacturer. However, a rotational speed of 2,450 r/min and a bowl diameter of 30 inch-
es (72.6 cm) are common for this type of sludge dewatering operation.
Therefore, the centrifugal force is

^

G = - • 
32.2 ft/s2

0 f ff ^

= 2,555 Gs

7. Find the polymer feed rate for the centrifuge

The major difficulty encountered in the operation of centrifuges is the disposal of the cen-
trate, which is relatively high in suspended, non-settling solids. The return of these solids
to the influent of the wastewater treatment facility can result in the passage of fine solids
through the treatment system, reducing effluent quality. Two methods are used to control
the fine solids discharge and increase the capture. These are: (1) increased residence time
in the centrifuge, and (2) polymer addition. Longer residence time of the liquid is accom-
plished by reducing the feed rate or by using a centrifuge with a larger bowl volume. Bet-
ter clarification of the centrate is achieved by coagulating the sludge prior to centrifuga-
tion through polymer addition. Solids capture may be increased from a range of 50 to 80
percent to a range of 80 to 95 percent by longer residence time and chemical conditioning
through polymer addition.
In order to obtain a cake solids concentration of 20 to 28 percent for an aerobically di-
gested sludge, 5 to 20 pounds of dry polymer per ton of dry sludge feed (2.27 to 9.08
kg/ton) is required. 15 Ib/ton (6.81 kg/ton) will be used for this example. Usually this val-
ue is determined through pilot testing or plant operator trial and error.
The polymer feed rate in Ib/h of dry polymer is calculated using the following:

„

The polymer feed rate is used to size the polymer dilution/feed equipment required for the
sludge dewatering operation.
Related Calculations. Selection of units for dewatering facility design is de-
pendent upon manufacturer's rating and performance data. Several manufacturers have
portable pilot plant units, which can be used for field testing if sludge is available. Waste-
water sludges from supposedly similar treatment processes but different localities can dif-
fer markedly from each other. For this reason, pilot plant tests should be run, whenever
possible, before final design decisions regarding centrifuge selection are made.

SIZING OFA TRAVELING-BRIDGE FILTER

Secondary effluent from a municipal wastewater treatment facility is to receive tertiary
treatment, including filtration, through the use of traveling bridge filters. The average dai-
ly flow rate is 4.0 Mgd (2778 gal/min) (15,140 m3/d) and the peaking factor is 2.5. Deter-
mine the size and number of traveling bridge filters required.

Calculation Procedure:

1. Determine the peak flow rate for the filter system

The traveling bridge filter is a proprietary form of a rapid sand filter. This type of filter is
used mainly for filtration of effluent from secondary and advanced wastewater treatment
facilities. In the traveling bridge filter, the incoming wastewater floods the filter bed,
flows through the filter medium (usually sand and/or anthracite), and exits to an effluent
channel via an underdrain and effluent ports located under each filtration cell. During the
backwash cycle, the carriage and the attached hood (see Fig. 5) move slowly over the fil-
ter bed, consecutively isolating and backwashing each cell. The washwater pump, located
in the effluent channel, draws filtered wastewater from the effluent chamber and pumps it
through the effluent port of each cell, forcing water to flow up through the cell thereby
backwashing the filter medium of the cell. The backwash pump located above the hood
draws water with suspended matter collected under the hood and transfers it to the back-
wash water trough. During the backwash cycle, wastewater is filtered continuously
through the cells not being backwashed.

Filtration in a traveling bridge filter is accomplished at a hydraulic loading typically in
the range of 1.5 to 3.0 gal/min per square foot of filter surface (1.02 to 2.04 L/s-m2) at av-
erage daily flow. The maximum hydraulic loading used for design is typically 4.0
gal/min/ft2 (2.72 L/s-m2) at peak flow. The peak hydraulic loading is used to size the trav-
eling bridge filter.
The peak flow for this treatment facility is calculated as follows:

Peak flow = (peaking factor)(average daily flow) = (2.5)(4.0 Mgd)
- 10 Mdg = 6944 gal/min (438.2 L/s)

Hydraulic loading (gal/mm-ft2)

Using values from above:

Filter surface area required (ft2) = 6^44 ^"^ = 1736 ft2 (161.3 m2)

3. Determine the number of filters required

Standard filter widths available from various manufacturers are 8, 12, and 16 ft (2.44,
3.66, and 4.88 m). Using a width of 12 feet (3.66 m) and length of 50 feet (15.2 m) per fil-
ter, the area of each filter is

Area of each filter = (12')(50') = 600 ft2 (55.7 m2)

The number of filters required is 1736 ft2/600 ft2 per filter = 2.89. Use 3 filters for a total
filter area of 1800 ft2 (167.2 m2).
It must be kept in mind that most state and local regulations stipulate that "rapid sand
filters shall be designed to provide a total filtration capacity for the maximum anticipated
flow with at least one of the filters out of service." Therefore, 4 traveling bridge filters
should be provided, each with filtration area dimensions of 12' wide x 50' long (3.66 m x
15.2m).
The media depth for traveling bridge filters ranges from 11" to 16" (27.9 to 40.6 cm).
Dual media may be used with 8" (20.3 cm) of sand underlying 8" (20.3 cm) of anthracite.

4. Find the hydraulic loading under various service conditions

The hydraulic loadings with all filters in operation is

Average flow: ^oof^ = L16 gal/min-ft2 (0.79 L/s-m2)

Peak flow: 694^^mm = 2.89 gal/min-ft2 (1.96 L/s-m2)

T^uUU Tt J

Hydraulic loading with 1 filter out of service (3 active filters) is

Average flow: 2 ™J^^ = 1 -54 gal/min-ft2 (1.05 L/s-m2)
3(600 it )

Peak flow: 694^g^mm = 3.86 gal/min-ft2 (2.62 L/s-m2)
3(600 rr)

These hydraulic loadings are acceptable and may be used in specifying the traveling
bridge filter.
The amount of backwash water produced depends upon the quantity and quality of in-
fluent to the filter. The backwash pumps are usually sized to deliver approximately 25
gal/min (1.58 L/s) during the backwash cycle. Backwash water is generally returned to
the head of the treatment facility for reprocessing.

DESIGN OFA RAPID-MIX BASIN
AND FLOCCULATION BASIN

1.0 Mdg (3785 m3/d) of equalized secondary effluent from a municipal waste water treat-
ment facility is to receive tertiary treatment through a direct filtration process which in-
cludes rapid mix with a polymer coagulant, flocculation and filtration. Size the rapid mix
and flocculation basins necessary for direct filtration and determine the horsepower of the
required rapid mixers and flocculators.

Calculation Procedure:

1. Determine the required volume of the rapid mix basin

A process flow diagram for direct filtration of a secondary effluent is presented in Fig. 6.
This form of tertiary wastewater treatment is used following secondary treatment when an
essentially "virus-free" effluent is desired for wastewater reclamation and reuse.
The rapid mix basin is a continuous mixing process in which the principle objective is
to maintain the contents of the tank in a completely mixed state. Although there are nu-
merous ways to accomplish continuous mixing, mechanical mixing will be used here. In
mechanical mixing, turbulence is induced through the input of energy by means of rotat-
ing impellers such as turbines, paddles, and propellers.
The hydraulic retention time of typical rapid mix operations in wastewater treatment
range from 5 to 20 seconds. A value of 15 seconds will be used here. The required volume
of the rapid mix basin is calculated as follows:

Volume (V) = (hydraulic retention time)(wastewater flow)

V= (I* s)(l x 10* gal/day) = 1?4 m 24 ft3 (0>68 m3)
86,400 s/d

2. Compute the power required for mixing

The power input per volume of liquid is generally used as a rough measure of mixing ef-
fectiveness, based on the reasoning that more input power creates greater turbulence, and
greater turbulence leads to better mixing. The following equation is used to calculate the
required power for mixing:

where G = Mean velocity gradient (s l)
P = Power requirement (ft-lb/s) (kW)
fju = Dynamic viscosity (lb-s/ft2) (Pa-s)
V= Volume of mixing tank (ft3) (m3)

G is a measure of the mean velocity gradient in the fluid. G values for rapid mixing oper-
ations in wastewater treatment range from 250 to 1,500 s"1 A value of 1,000 s"1 will be
used here. For water at 6O0F (15.50C), dynamic viscosity is 2.36 x IQ-5 lb-s/ft2 (1.13 x
10~3 Pa-s). Therefore, the required power for mixing is computed as follows:

P = G2IJiV= (1,000 s~1)2(2.36 x 10-5 Ib-s/ft2)(24 ft3) = 566 ft-lb/s
= 1.03 horsepower (0.77 kW)

Use the next largest motor size available = 1.5 horsepower (1.12 kW). Therefore, a 1.5
horsepower (1.12 kW) mixer should be used.

3. Determine the required volume and power input for flocculation

The purpose of flocculation is to form aggregates, or floes, from finely divided matter.
The larger floes allow a greater solids removal in the subsequent filtration process. In the
direct filtration process, the wastewater is completely mixed with a polymer coagulant in
the rapid mix basin. Following rapid mix, the flocculation tanks gently agitate the waste-
water so that large "floes" form with the help of the polymer coagulant. As in the rapid
mix basins, mechanical flocculators will be utilized.
For flocculation in a direct filtration process, the hydraulic retention time will range
from 2 to 10 minutes. A retention time of 8 minutes will be used here. Therefore, the re-
quired volume of the flocculation basin is

F= (Sn1In)(I x 1O^ gal/day) = a l ? 4 3 f t 2l
l,440mm/d

G values for flocculation in a direct filtration process range from 20 to 100 s"1. A value of
80 s"1 will be used here. Therefore, the power required for flocculation is

P = G2VV= (80 s~1)2(2.36 x 10-5)(743 ft3)
= 112 ft-lb/s = 0.2 horsepower (0.15 kW)

Use the next largest motor size available = 0.5 horsepower (0.37 kW). Therefore, a 0.5
horsepower (0.37 kW) flocculator should be used.
It is common practice to taper the energy input to flocculation basins so that floes ini-
tially formed will not be Broken as they leave the flocculation facilities. In the above ex-
ample, this may be accomplished by providing a second flocculation basin in series with
the first. The power input to the second basin is calculated using a lower G value (such as
50 s"1) and hence provides a gentler agitation.
Related Calculations. If the flows to the rapid mix and flocculation basin vary
significantly, or turn down capability is desired, a variable speed drive should be provided
for each mixer and flocculator. The variable speed drive should be controlled via an out-
put signal from a flow meter immediately upstream of each respective basin.
It should be noted that the above analysis provides only approximate values for mixer
and flocculator sizes. Mixing is in general a "black art," and a mixing manufacturer is
usually consulted regarding the best type and size of mixer or flocculator for a particular
application.

SIZING A POLYMER DILUTION/
FEED SYSTEM

1.0 Mgd (3,785 m3/d) of equalized secondary effluent from a municipal wastewater treat-
ment facility is to undergo coagulation and flocculation in a direct filtration process. The
coagulant used will be an emulsion polymer with 30 percent active ingredient. Size the
polymer dilution/feed system including: the quantity of dilution water required, and the
amount of neat (as supplied) polymer required.

Calculation Procedure:

1. Determine the daily polymer requirements

Depending on the quality of settled secondary effluent, organic polymer addition is often
used to enhance the performance of tertiary effluent filters in a direct filtration process:
see Design of a Rapid Mix Basin and Flocculation Basin. Because the chemistry of the
wastewater has a significant effect on the performance of a polymer, the selection of a
type of polymer for use as a filter aid generally requires experimental testing. Common
test procedures for polymers involve adding an initial polymer dosage to the wastewater
(usually 1 part per million, ppm) of a given polymer and observing the effects. Depending
upon the effects observed, the polymer dosage should be increased or decreased by 0.5
ppm increments to obtain an operating range. A polymer dosage of 2 ppm (2 parts poly-
mer per 1 x 106 parts wastewater) will be used here.
In general, the neat polymer is supplied with approximately 25 to 35 percent active
polymer, the rest being oil and water. As stated above, a 30 percent active polymer will be
used for this example. The neat polymer is first diluted to an extremely low concentration
using dilution water, which consists of either potable water or treated effluent from the
wastewater facility. The diluted polymer solution usually ranges from 0.005 to 0.5 per-
cent solution. The diluted solution is injected into either a rapid mix basin or directly into
a pipe. A 0.5 percent solution will be used here.
The gallons per day (gal/day) (L/d) of active polymer required is calculated using the
following:

Active polymer (gal/day) = (wastewater flow, Mgd)
x (active polymer dosage, ppm)

Using the values outlined above:

Active polymer = (1.0 Mgd)(2 ppm) = 2 gal/day active polymer (pure polymer)
= 0.083 gal/hr (gal/h) (0.31 L/h)

DESIGN OFA TRICKLING FILTER USING
THE NRC EQUATIONS

A municipal wastewater with a flow rate of 1.0 Mgd (3,785 m3/d) and a BOD5 of 240
mg/L is to be treated by a two stage trickling filter system. The effluent wastewater is to
have a BOD5 of 20 mg/L. Both filters are to have a depth of 7 feet (2.1 m) and a recircu-
lation ratio of 2. Filter media will consist of rock. Size both stages of the trickling filter
assuming the efficiency (E) of each stage is the same.

Calculation Procedure:

1. Find the efficiency of the trickling filters

The modern trickling filter, shown in Fig. 7, consists of a bed of highly permeable medi-
um to which microorganisms are attached and through which wastewater is percolated or
trickled. The filter media usually consists of either rock or a variety of plastic packing ma-
terials. The depth of rock varies but usually ranges from 3 to 8 feet (0.91 to 244 m). Trick-
ling filters are generally circular, and the wastewater is distributed over the top of the bed
by a rotary distributor.
Filters are constructed with an underdrain system for collecting the treated wastewater
and any biological solids that have become detached from the media. This underdrain sys-
tem is important both as a collection unit and as a porous structure through which air can
circulate. The collected liquid is passed to a settling tank where the solids are separated
from the treated wastewater. In practice, a portion of the treated wastewater is recycled to
dilute the strength of the incoming wastewater and to maintain the biological slime layer
in a moist condition.
The organic material present in the wastewater is degraded by a population of mi-
croorganisms attached to the filter media. Organic material from the wastewater is ab-
sorbed onto the biological slime layer. As the slime layer increases in thickness, the mi-
croorganisms near the media face lose their ability to cling to the media surface. The

ing: Treatment, Disposal, and Reuse, 3rd Ed., McGraw-Hill.)

liquid then washes the slime off the media, and a new slime layer starts to grow. The phe-
nomenon of losing the slime layer is called "sloughing" and is primarily a function of the
organic and hydraulic loading on the filter.
Two possible process flow schematics for a two-stage trickling filter system are
shown in Fig. 8.
The NRC equations for trickling filter performance are empirical equations which are
primarily applicable to single and multistage rock systems with recirculation.
The overall efficiency of the two-stage trickling filter is calculated using:

4. Compute the BOD5 loading and hydraulic loading to each filter

The BOD5 (organic) loading to each filter is calculated by dividing the BOD5 loading by
the volume of the filter in 103 ft3 (m3):

First stage filter: BOD5 loading = Jffig^ = 108.2 -^

Second stage filter: BOD5 loading = J™^ = 8.97 -^

(1.74kg/m3-d)

(0.14kg/m3-d)

BOD5 loading for a first stage filter in a two stage system typically ranges from 60 to
120 lb/103 ft3-d (0.96 to 1.93 kg/m3-d). The second stage filter loading typically ranges
from 5 to 20 lb/103 ft3-d (0.08 to 0.32 kg/m3-d).

Hydraulic loading for two stage trickling filter systems typically ranges from 0.16 to 0.64
gal/min-ft2 (0.11 to 0.43 L/s-m2).
Related Calculations. In practice, the diameter of the two filters should be
rounded to the nearest 5 ft (1.52 m) to accommodate standard rotary distributor mecha-
nisms. To reduce construction costs, the two trickling filters are often made the same size.
When both filters in a two stage trickling filter system are the same size, the efficiencies
will be unequal and the analysis will be an iterative one.

DESIGN OFA PLASTIC MEDIA
TRICKLING FILTER

A municipal wastewater with a flow of 1.0 Mgd (694 gal/min) (3,785 m3/d) and a BOD5
of 240 mg/L is to be treated in a single stage plastic media trickling filter without recycle.
The effluent wastewater is to have a BOD5 of 20 mg/L. Determine the diameter of the fil-
ter, the hydraulic loading, the organic loading, the dosing rate, and the required rotational
speed of the distributor arm. Assume a filter depth of 25 feet (7.6 m). Also assume that a
treatability constant (k20/2o) °f 0.075 (gal/min)0 5/ft2 was obtained in a 20 foot (6.1 m)
high test filter at 2O0C (680F). The wastewater temperature is 3O0C (860F).

Calculation Procedure:

1. Adjust the treatability constant for wastewater
temperature and depth

Due to the predictable properties of plastic media, empirical relationships are available to
predict performance of trickling filters packed with plastic media. However, the treatabil-

ity constant must first be adjusted for both the temperature of the wastewater and the
depth of the actual filter.
Adjustment for temperature. The treatability constant is first adjusted from the given
standard at 2O0C (680F) to the actual wastewater temperature of 3O0C (860F) using the
following equation:

^30/2O = £20/20 0r~2°

where ^30720 = Treatability constant at 3O0C (860F) and 20 foot (6.1 m) filter depth
Ar20720= Treatability constant at 2O0C (680F) and 20 foot (6.1 m) filter depth
6 = Temperature activity coefficient (assume 1.035)
T = Wastewater temperature

Using above values:

£30/20 = (0.075 (gal/min)0 VfF)(1.035)30-20 = 0.106 (gal/min)0 5/ft2

Adjustment for depth. The treatability constant is then adjusted from the standard depth of
20 feet (6.1 m) to the actual filter depth of 25 feet (7.6 m) using the following equation:

£30/25 = £30/20(^1/^2)*

where &30725 = Treatability constant at 3O0C (860F) and 25 foot (7.6 m) filter depth
£30/20 = Treatability constant at 3O0C (860F) and 20 foot (6.1 m) filter depth
D1 = Depth of reference filter (20 feet) (6.1 m)
D2 = Depth of actual filter (25 feet) (7.6 m)
jc = Empirical constant (0.3 for plastic medium filters)

Using above values:

£30/25 = (0.106 (gal/mm)0-5/ft2)(20/25)°-3
= 0.099 (gal/min)0 5/ft2 (0.099 (L/s)° 5/m2)

2. Size the plastic media trickling filter

The empirical formula used for sizing plastic media trickling filters is

SIZING OFA ROTARY-LOBE SLUDGE PUMP

A municipal wastewater treatment facility produces approximately 6,230 gal/day (23.6
m3/d) of aerobically digested sludge at 5 percent solids. The digested sludge is pumped to
a sludge dewatering facility which is operated 4 h/d, 7 d/wk; 1000 ft (304.8 m) of 3 in
(76.3 mm) equivalent length pipe exists between the aerobic digester and the dewatering
facility. The equivalent length of pipe includes all valves, fittings, discharge pipe, and
suction pipe lengths in the sludge piping system. The static head on the sludge pump is 10
feet (3.0 m). Size a rotary-lobe pump transfer sludge from the digester to the dewatering
facility, including pump discharge and head condition, rpm and motor horsepower (kW).

Calculation Procedure:

1. Find the flow rate required for the sludge pump

A schematic of the sludge handling system is illustrated in Fig. 9. Rotary-lobe pumps are
positive-displacement pumps in which two rotating synchronous lobes push the fluid
through the pump. Although these types of pumps are advertised as self-priming, they are

FIGURE 9. Sludge handling system.

generally located so as to have a suction head as shown in Fig. 9. A schematic of a rotary
lobe pump is shown in Fig. 10.
The required flow rate for the sludge pump using the 4 h/d, 7 d/wk operation scheme

is:

6,230 gal/day
Flow rate (gal/min) = (4 ^60 ^ - 26 ga./min (1.64 L/s)

2. Compute the headless in the piping system

The head loss through the piping system is calculated using the Hazen-Williams formula:
/ 100 \ i .85/ Q185 \i L

Using values given above, the dynamic head loss in the piping system at the design
flow rate of 26 gal/min (1.64 L/s) is:

/ 100 \ i .85/ (26 gal/min)1-85

26 gal/min
Vel°dty = (7.48 gal/tfX(^4X3 in/12 in/ft)')(60 s/min) = L2 *" (0'37 "^

Using Fig. 11 with a velocity of 1.2 ft/s (0.37 m/s) and a solids content of 5 percent, the
multiplication factor (k) is 12. Therefore, the dynamic head loss for this system when
pumping 5 percent solids is:

Dynamic Head Loss5o/0 = (Dynamic Head Losswater)(&)

Dynamic Head Loss5o/0 = (4.12')(12) = 49.44 feet (15.1 m)

Use 50 feet of head loss (15.2 m)

The total head loss is the sum of the static head and the dynamic head Ioss5o/0. Therefore,
the total head loss (Total Dynamic Head or TDH) for the system is

10 '+ 5 0 '= 60 feet (18.3m)

This translates to a discharge pressure on the pump of

TDH = (60')/(2.31 ft/psi) = 26 IMn2 (179.1 kPa)

Therefore, the design condition for the rotary lobe pump is 26 gal/min (1.64 L/s) at 26
lb/in2 (179. IkPa ).

3. Choose the correct pump for the application

At this point, a rotary lobe pump manufacturers catalog is required in order to choose the
correct pump curve for this application. This is accomplished by choosing a pump per-
formance curve that meets the above design condition. An example of a manufacturers
curve that satisfies the design condition is shown in Fig. 12.
Plotting a horizontal line from 26 gal/min (1.64 L/s) on the left to the 26 lb/in2 (179.1
kPa) pressure line and reading down gives a pump speed of approximately 175 rpm. This
means that for this pump to deliver 26 gal/min (1.64 L/s) against a pressure of 26 lb/in2
(179.1 kPa), it must operate at 175 rpm.
The motor horsepower required for the rotary lobe pump is calculated using the fol-
lowing empirical formula (taken from the catalog of Alfa Laval Pumps, Inc. of Kenosha,
WI):

Sf= Factor related to pump size which is calculated using: Sf= (#)(0.757) + 3
Nf= Factor related to the viscosity of the pumped liquid which is calculated using

The pump speed was found in Fig. 12 to be 175 rpm; the pump displacement is taken

4. Determine the pump horsepower

The viscosity of a sewage sludge is dependent upon the percent solids and may be found
using Table 3.
Using Table 3, a 5 percent solids sludge has a viscosity of 1,050 cp. Therefore:

Nf= 2.2 Vl,050 cp = 22.36

Using the values outlined above, the motor horsepower is calculated:

The resulting horsepower of 1.3 hp (0.97 kW) is at best an informed estimate of the horse-
power which will be absorbed at the pump shaft during pumping. It includes no service
factor or margin for error, neither does it allow for inefficiency in power transmission sys-
tems.

5. Find the installed horsepower of the pump

Actual installed horsepower will need to be greater than this calculated horsepower to al-
low for the random torque increases due to large solids and to provide a prudent safety
factor. Therefore, the minimum installed motor horsepower is calculated as follows:

(1.2)(Calculatedhp)
Installed Motor hp =

Assuming a motor efficiency of 90 percent, the installed motor horsepower is

Installed Motor hp = (L2)(1
Q^hp) x 100 = 1.73 hp (1.29 kW)
90/o

Use the next largest motor size available, which is 2.0 hp (1.49 kW). Therefore, the rotary
lobe sludge pump will have a 2.0 hp (1.49 kW) motor.
To summarize, the requirements for a rotary lobe pump for this application are: design
condition of 26 gal/min (1.64 L/s) at 26 lb/in2 (179.1 kPa), operating at 175 rpm with a
2.0 hp (1.49 kW) motor. Often a variable speed drive is provided so that the pump rpm
(hence flow rate) may be adjusted to suit varying sludge flow rate demands at the down-
stream dewatering facility. Also, a second pump is generally provided as a spare.

DESIGN OF AN ANAEROBIC DIGESTOR

A high rate anaerobic digestor is to be designed to treat a mixture of primary and waste
activated sludge produced by a wastewater treatment facility. The input sludge to the di-
gester is 60,000 gal/day (227.1 m3/d) of primary and waste activated sludge with an aver-
age loading of 25,000 Ib/d (11,350 kg/d) of ultimate BOD (BODL). Assume the yield co-
efficient (Y) is 0.06 Ib VSS/lb BODL (kg/kg), and the endogenous coefficient (kd) is 0.03
d"1 at 350C (950F). Also assume that the efficiency of waste utilization in the digester is
60 percent. Compute the digester volume required, the volume of methane gas produced,
the total volume of digester gas produced, and the percent stabilization of the sludge.

Calculation Procedure:

1. Determine the required digester volume and loading

Anaerobic digestion is one of the oldest processes used for the stabilization of sludge. It
involves the decomposition of organic and inorganic matter in the absence of molecular
oxygen. The major applications of this process ar,e in the stabilization of concentrated
sludges produced from the treatment of wastewater.
In the anaerobic digestion process, the organic material is converted biologically, un-
der anaerobic conditions, to a variety of end products including methane (CH4) and car-
bon dioxide (CO2). The process is carried out in an airtight reactor. Sludge, introduced
continuously or intermittently, is retained in the reactor for varying periods of time. The
stabilized sludge, withdrawn continuously or intermittently from the reactor, is reduced in
organic and pathogen content and is nonputrescible.
In the high rate digestion process, as shown in Fig. 13, the contents of the digester are
heated and completely mixed. For a complete-mix flow through digester, the mean cell
residence time (0C) is the same as the hydraulic retention time (B).
In the United States, the use and disposal of sewage sludge is regulated under 40 CFR
Part 503 promulgated February 1993. The new regulation replaces 40 CFR Part 257—the
original regulation governing the use and disposal of sewage sludge, in effect since 1979.
The new regulations state that "for anaerobic digestion, the values for the mean-cell-
residence time and temperature shall be between 15 days at 350C (950F) to 550C (1310F)
and 60 days at 2O0C (680F)."
Therefore, for an operating temperature of 350C (950F), a mean cell residence time of
15 days will be used. The influent sludge flow rate (0 
is 60,000 gal/day = 8,021 fVVd
(226.9 m3/d). The digester volume Vrequired is computed using

The BOD entering the digester 25,000 Ib/d (11,350 kg/d). Therefore, the volumetric load-
ing to the digester is

Volumetric Loading = 25?°^ ^ B°D/d = 0.21 Ib/ftM (3.37 kg/m3-d)

For high rate digesters, loadings range from 0.10 to 0.35 Ib/ft3-d (1.6 to 5.61 kg/m3-d).
Assuming 60 percent waste utilization, the BODL exiting the digester is

(25,000 lb/d)(l - 0.6) = 10,000 Ib/d (4,540 kg/d)

2. Compute the daily quantity of volatile solids produced

The quantity of volatile solids produced each day is computed using

where Px = Volatile solids produced, Ib/d (kg/d)

3. Determine the volume of methane produced

The volume of methane gas produced at standard conditions (320F and 1 arm) (O0C and
101.3 kPa) is calculated using

FCH4 = 5.62 ft3/lb[(BODin, Ib/d) - (BODout, Ib/d) - 1.42 PJ

where FCH4 = Volume of methane gas produced at standard conditions (ft3/d) (m3/d)

Using values obtained above:

FCH4 = 5.62 ft3/lb[(25,000 Ib/d) - (10,000 Ib/d) - 1.42(621 Ib/d)]
= 79,344 fVVd (2,245 m3/d)

Since digester gas is approximately 2/3 methane, the volume of digester gas produced is

(79,344 ft3/d)10.67 = 118,424 ft3/d (3,351.4 m3/d)

4. Calculate the percent stabilization

Related Calculations. This disadvantages and advantages of the anaerobic treat-
ment of sludge, as compared to aerobic treatment, are related to the slow growth rate of
the methanogenic (methane producing) bacteria. Slow growth rates require a relatively
long retention time in the digester for adequate waste stabilization to occur. With
methanogenic bacteria, most of the organic portion of the sludge is converted to methane
gas, which is combustible and therefore a useful end product. If sufficient quantities of
methane gas are produced, the methane gas can be used to operate duel-fuel engines to
produce electricity and to provide building heat.

DESIGN OFA CHLORINATION SYSTEM
FOR WASTE WATER DISINFECTION

Chlorine is to be used for disinfection of a municipal wastewater. Estimate the chlorine
residual that must be maintained to achieve a coliform count equal to or less than 200/100
ml in an effluent from an activated sludge facility assuming that the effluent requiring dis-
infection contains a coliform count of 1O7AOO ml. The average wastewater flow requiring
disinfection is 0.5 Mgd (1,892.5 m3/d) with a peaking factor of 2.8. Using the estimated
residual, determine the capacity of the chlorinator. Per regulations, the chlorine contact
time must not be less than 15 minutes at peak flow.

Calculation Procedure:

1. Find the required residual for the allowed residence time

The reduction of coliform organisms in treated effluent is defined by the following equa-
tion:

- J - = (1 +0.23QO-3

yvo

where Nt = Number of coliform organisms at time t
NQ = Number of coliform organisms at time ^0
Ct = Total chlorine residual at time t (mg/L)
t = Residence time (min)

Using values for coliform count from above:

irf =0+0.23Q)-3

2 . Ox 10-5 = (1+0.23Q)-3
5 . Ox 104 = (1+0.23Q)3

1+0 .23Qf = 36.84
Q= 155.8 mg-min/L
For a residence time of 15 minutes, the required residual is

Ct = (155.8 mg-min/L)/15 min = 10.38 mg/L

The chlorination system should be designed to provide chlorine residuals over a range
of operating conditions and should include an adequate margin of safety. Therefore, the
dosage required at peak flow will be set at 15 mg/L.

2. Determine the required capacity of the chlorinator

The capacity of the chlorinator at peak flow with a dosage of 15 mg/L is calculated using:

Cl2 (Ib/d) = (Dosage, mg/L)(Avg flow, Mgd)(P.F.)(8.34)

where

Cl2 = Pounds of chlorine required per day (kg/d)
Dosage = Dosage used to obtain coliform reduction
Avg. Flow = Average flow
P.F. = Peaking factor for average flow
8.34 = 8.34 lb-L/Mgal-mg

Using values from above:

Cl2 (Ib/d) = (15 mg/L)(0.5 Mgd)(2.8)(8.34) = 175 Ib/d (79.5 kg/d)

The next largest standard chlorinator size is 200 Ib/d (90.8 kg/d). Therefore, two 200
Ib/d (90.8 kg/d) chlorinators will be used with one serving as a spare. Although the peak
capacity will not be required during most of the day, it must be available to meet chlorine
requirements at peak flow.

3. Compute the daily consumption of chlorine

The average daily consumption of chlorine assuming an average dosage of 15 mg/L is

Cl2 (Ib/d) - (15 mg/L)(0.5 Mgd)(8.34) = 62.5 Ib/d (28.4 kg/d)

A typical chlorination flow diagram is shown in Fig. 14. This is a compound loop sys-
tem which means the chlorine dosage is controlled through signals received from both ef-
fluent flow rate and chlorine residual.

SANITARY SEWER SYSTEM DESIGN

What size main sanitary sewer is required for a midwestern city 30-acre (1.21 * 105 m2)
residential area containing six-story apartment houses if the hydraulic gradient is 0.0035
and the pipe roughness factor « = 0.013? One-third of the area is served by a branch sew-
er. What should the size of this sewer be? If the branch and main sewers must also handle
groundwater infiltration, determine the required sewer size. The sewer is below the nor-
mal groundwater level.

Calculation Procedure:

1. Compute the sanitary sewage flow rate

Table 4 shows the typical population per acre for various residential areas and the flow
rate used in sewer design. Using the typical population of 500 persons per acre (4046 m2)
given in Table 4, we see the total population of the area served is (30 acres)(500 persons
per acres) = 15,000 persons.
Since this is a midwestern city, the sewer design basis, per capita, used for Des
Moines, Iowa, 200 gal/day (8.76 mL/s), Table 4, appears to be an appropriate value.
Checking with the minimum flow recommended in Table 4, 100 gal/day (4.38 mL/s), we
see the value of 200 gal/day (8.76 mL/s) seems to be well justified. Hence, the sanitary
sewage flow rate that the main sewer must handle is (15,000 persons)(200 gal/day) =
3,000,000 gal/day.

2. Convert the flow rate to cfs

Use the relation cfs = 1.55 (gpd/106), where cfs = flow rate, fWs; gpd = flow rate, gal/24
h. So cfs = 1.55(3,000,000/1,000,000) = 465 fWs (0.13 m3/s).

3. Compute the required size of the main sewer

Size the main sewer on the basis of its flowing full. This is the usual design procedure fol-
lowed by experienced sanitary engineers.
Two methods can be used to size the sewer pipe, (a) Use the chart in Fig. 4, Section
14, for the Manning formula, entering with the flow rate of 4.65 fWs (0.13 m3/s) and pro-
jecting to the slope ratio or hydraulic gradient of 0.0035. Read the required pipe diameter
as 18 in (457 mm).
(b) Use the Manning formula and the appropriate conveyance factor from Table 5.
When the conveyance factor Cfis used, the Manning formula becomes Q = CfSm, where
Q = flow rate through the pipe, ft3/s; Cf= conveyance factor corresponding to a specific n
value listed in Table 5; S = pipe slope or hydraulic gradient, ft/ft. Since Q and S are
known, substitute and solve for C7, or Cf= Q/Sm = 4.65/(0.0035)1/2 = 78.5. Enter Table 5

at n = 0.013 and Cf= 78.5, and project to the exact or next higher value of Cf. Table 5
shows that C7Is 64.70 for 15-in (381-mm) pipe and 105.1 for 18-in (457-mm) pipe. Since
the actual value of Cf is 78.5, a 15-in (381-mm) pipe would be too small. Hence, an 18-in
(457-mm) pipe would be used. This size agrees with that found in procedure a.

4. Compute the size of the lateral sewer

The lateral sewer serves one-third of the total area. Since the total sanitary flow from the
entire area is 4.65 ft3/s (0.13 m3/s), the flow from one-third of the area, given an even dis-
tribution of population and the same pipe slope, is 4.65/3 = 1.55 ft3/s (0.044 m3/s). Using
either procedure in step 3, we find the required pipe size = 12 in (305 mm). Hence, three
12-in (302-mm) laterals will discharge into the main sewer, assuming that each lateral
serves an equal area and has the same slope.

5. Check the suitability of the main sewer size

Compute the value of d2-5 for each of the lateral sewer pipes discharging into the main
sewer pipe. Thus, for one 12-in (305-mm) lateral line, where d = smaller pipe diameter,
in, d25 = 1225 = 496. For three pipes of equal diameter, 3d2-5 = 1488 = D25, where D =
larger pipe diameter, in. Solving gives D25 = 1488 and D = 17.5 in (445 mm). Hence, the
18-in (4570 mm) sewer main has sufficient capacity to handle the discharge of three 12-in
(305-mm) sewers. Note that Fig. 4, Section 14, shows that the flow velocity in both the
lateral and main sewers exceeds the minimum required velocity of 2 ft/s (0.6 m/s).

6. Compute the sewer size with infiltration

Infiltration is the groundwater that enters a sewer. The quantity and rate of infiltration de-
pend on the character of the soil in which the sewer is laid, the relative position of the
groundwater level and the sewer, the diameter and length of the sewer, and the material
and care with which the sewer is constructed. With tile and other jointed sewers, infiltra-
tion depends largely on the type of joint used in the pipes. In large concrete or brick sew-
ers, the infiltration depends on the type of waterproofing applied.
Infiltration is usually expressed in gallons per day per mile of sewer. With very careful
construction, infiltration can be kept down to 5000 gal/(daymi) [0.14 L/(km-s)] of pipe
even when the groundwater level is above the pipe. With poor construction, porous soil,
and high groundwater level, infiltration may amount to 100,000 gal/(daymi) [2.7
L/(knvs)] or more. Sewers laid in dense soil where the groundwater level is below the
sewer do not experience infiltration except during and immediately after a rainfall. Even
then, the infiltration will be in small amounts.
Assuming an infiltration rate of 20,000 gal/(daymi) [0.54 L/(knrs)] of sewer and a
sewer length of 1.2 mi (1.9 km) for this city, we see the daily infiltration is 1.2 (20,000) =
24,000 gal (90,850 L).
Checking the pipe size by either method in step 3 shows that both the 12-in (305-mm)
laterals and the 18-in (457-mm) main are of sufficient size to handle both the sanitary and
infiltration flow.
Related Calculations. Where a sewer must also handle the runoff from fire-
fighting apparatus, compute the quantity of fire-fighting water for cities of less than
200,000 population from Q = 1020(P)0 5 [1 - 0.01(P)05], where Q = fire demand, gal/min;
P = city population in thousands. Add the fire demand to the sanitary sewage and infiltra-
tion flows to determine the maximum quantity of liquid the sewer must handle. For cities
having a population of more than 200,000 persons, consult the fire department headquar-
ters to determine the water flow quantities anticipated.
Some sanitary engineers apply a demand factor to the average daily water require-
ments per capita before computing the flow rate into the sewer. Thus, the maximum
monthly water consumption is generally about 125 percent of the average annual demand
but may range up to 200 percent of the average annual demand. Maximum daily demands

of 150 percent of the average annual demand and maximum hourly demands of 200 to
250 percent of the annual average demand are commonly used for design by some sani-
tary engineers. To apply a demand factor, simply multiply the flow rate computed in step
2 by the appropriate factor. Current practice in the use of demand factors varies; sewers
designed without demand factors are generally adequate. Applying a demand factor sim-
ply provides a margin of safety in the design, and the sewer is likely to give service for a
longer period before becoming overloaded.
Most local laws and many sewer authorities recommend that no sewer be less than 8 in
(203 mm) in diameter. The sewer should be sloped sufficiently to give a flow velocity of
2 ft/s (0.6 m/s) or more when flowing full. This velocity prevents the deposit of solids in
the pipe. Manholes serving sewers should not be more than 400 ft (121.9 m) apart.
Where industrial sewage is discharged into a sanitary sewer, the industrial flow quan-
tity must be added to the domestic sewage flow quantity before the pipe size is chosen.
Swimming pools may also be drained into sanitary sewers and may cause temporary
overflowing because the sewer capacity is inadequate. The sanitary sewage flow rate
from an industrial area may be less than from a residential area of the same size because
the industrial population is smaller.
Many localities and cities restrict the quantity of commercial and industrial sewage
that may be discharged into public sewers. Thus, one city restricts commercial sewage
from stores, garages, beauty salons, etc., to 135 gal/day per capita. Another city restricts
industrial sewage from factories and plants to 50,000 gal/(dayacre) [0.55 mL/(m-s)]. In
other cities each proposed installation must be studied separately. Still other cities prohib-
it any discharge of commercial or industrial sewage into sanitary sewers. For these rea-
sons, the local authorities and sanitary codes, if any, must be consulted before the design
of any sewer is begun.
Before starting a sewer design, do the following: (a) Prepare a profile diagram of the
area that will be served by the sewer. Indicate on the diagram the elevation above grade of
each profile, (b) Compile data on the soil, groundwater level, type of paving, number and
type of foundations, underground services (gas, electric, sewage, water supply, etc.), and
other characteristics of the area that will be served by the sewer, (c) Sketch the main sew-
er and lateral sewers on the profile diagram. Indicate the proposed direction of sewage
flow by arrows. With these steps finished, start the sewer design.
To design the sewers, proceed as follows: (a) Size the sewers using the procedure giv-
en in steps 1 through 6 above, (b) Check the sewage flow rate to see that it is 2 ft/s (0.56
m/s) or more, (c) Check the plot to see that the required slope for the pipes can be ob-
tained without expensive blasting or rock removal.
Where the outlet of a building plumbing system is below the level of the sewer serving
the building, a pump must be used to deliver the sewage to the sewer. Compute the pump
capacity, using the discharge from the various plumbing fixtures in the building as the
source of the liquid flow to the pump. The head on the pump is the difference between the
level of the sewage in the pump intake and the centerline of the sewer into which the
pump discharges, plus any friction losses in the piping.

SELECTION OF SEWAGE-TREATMENT
METHOD

A city of 100,000 population is considering installing a new sewage-treatment plant. Se-
lect a suitable treatment method. Local ordinances required that suspended matter in the
sewage be reduced 80 percent, that bacteria be reduced 60 percent, and that the biochem-

ical oxygen demand be reduced 90 percent. The plant will handle only domestic sanitary
sewage. What are the daily oxygen demand and the daily suspended-solids content of the
sewage? If an industrial plant discharges into this system sewage requiring 4500 Ib
(2041.2 kg) of oxygen per day, determine the population equivalent of the industrial
sewage.

Calculation Procedure:

1. Compute the daily sewage flow

With an average flow per capita of 200 gal/day (8.8 mL/s), this sewage treatment plant
must handle per capita (200 gal/day)( 100,000 population) = 20,000 gal/day (896.2 L/s).

2. Compute the sewage oxygen demand

Usual domestic sewage shows a 5-day oxygen demand of 0.12 to 0.17 Ib/day (0.054 to
0.077 kg/day) per person. With an average of 0.15 Ib (0.068 kg) per person per day, the
daily oxygen demand of the sewage is (0.15)( 100,000) = 15,000 Ib/day (78/7 g/s).

3. Compute the suspended-solids content of the sewage

Usual domestic sewage contains about 0.25 Ib (0.11 kg) of suspended solids per person
per day. Using this average, we see the total quantity of suspended solids that must be
handled is (0.25)( 100,000) = 25,000 Ib/day (0.13 kg/s).

4. Select the sewage-treatment method

Table 6 shows the efficiency of various sewage-treatment methods. Since the desired re-
duction in suspended matter, biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), and bacteria is known,
this will serve as a guide to the initial choice of the equipment.
Study of Table 6 shows that a number of treatments are available which will reduce
the suspended matter by 80 percent. Hence, any one of these methods might be used. The
same is true for the desired reduction in bacteria and BOD. Thus, the system choice re-
solves to selection of the most economical group of treatment units.
For a city of this size, four steps of sewage treatment would be advisable. The first
step, preliminary treatment, could include screening to remove large suspended solids,
grit removal, and grease removal. The next step, primary treatment, could include sedi-
mentation or chemical precipitation. Secondary treatment, the next step, might be of a bi-
ological type such as the activated-sludge process or the trickling filter. In the final step,
the sewage might be treated by cholorination. Treated sewage can then be disposed of in
fields, streams, or other suitable areas.
Choose the following units for this sewage-treatment plant, using the data in Table 6
as a guide: rocks or screens to remove large suspended solids, grit chambers to remove
grit, skimming tanks for grease removal, plain sedimentation, activated-sludge process,
and chlorination.
Reference to Table 6 shows that screens and plain sedimentation will reduce the sus-
pended solids by the desired amount. Likewise, the activated-sludge process reduces the
BOD by up to 95 percent and the bacteria up to 95+ percent. Hence, the chosen system
satisfies the design requirements.

5. Compute the population equivalent of the industrial sewage

Use the relation Pe = RID, where Pe = population equivalent of the industrial sewage, per-
sons; R — required oxygen of the sewage, Ib/day; D = daily oxygen demand, Ib per person
per day. So Pe = 4500/0.15 = 30,000 persons.
Related Calculations. Where sewage is combined (i.e., sanitary and storm
sewage mixed), the 5-day per-capita oxygen demand is about 0.25 Ib/day (0.11 kg/day).
Where large quantities of industrial waste are part of combined sewage, the per-capita

oxygen demand is usually about 0.5 Ib/day (0.23 kg/day). To convert the strength of an
industrial waste to the same base used for sanitary waste, apply the population equivalent
relation in step 5. Some cities use the population equivalent as a means of evaluating the
load placed on the sewage-treatment works by industrial plants.
Table 7 shows the products resulting from various sewage-treatment processes per
million gallons of sewage treated. The tabulated data are useful for computing the volume
of product each process produces.
Environmental considerations are leading to the adoption of biogas methods to handle
the organic fraction of municipal solid waste (MSW). Burning methane-rich biogas can
meet up to 60 percent of the operating cost of waste-to-energy plants. Further, generating
biogas avoids the high cost of disposing of this odorous by-product. A further advantage
is that biogas plants are exempt from energy or carbon taxes. Newer plants also handle in-
dustrial wastes, converting them to biogas.
Biogas plants are popular in Europe. The first anaerobic digestion plant capable of
treating unsorted MSW handles 55,000 mt/yr. It treats wastestreams with solids contents
of 30 to 35 percent. Automated sorting first removes metals, plastics, paperboard, glass,
and inerts from the MSW stream. The remaining organic fraction is mixed with recycled
water from a preceding compost-drying press to form a 30 to 35 percent solids sludge
which is pumped into one of the plant's three 2400-m3 (84,720 ft3) disgesters.
Residence time in the digester is about 3 weeks with a biogas yield of 99 m3/mt of
MSW (3495 ft3/t), or 146 mVmt (5154 ft3/t) of sorted organic fraction. Overflow liquid
from the digester is pressed, graded, and sold as compost. Mixtures of MSW, sewage

sludges, and animal slurries can also be digested in this process (Valorga) developed by
Valorga SA (Vendargues, France). This is termed a dry process.
Wet processes handle wastestreams with only 10 to 15 percent solids content. Featur-
ing more than one digestion stage, it is easier to control parameters such as pH and solids
concentration than dry fermentation. The first plant to use wet digestion to process MSW
is 20,000-mt/yr installation in Denmark. About two-thirds of the annual operating cost of
$2 million is recovered through the sale of biogas. In a 14,000-mt/yr plant in Finland the
biogas produced is used to fire a gas turbine. Multiple stages are said to make wet fer-
mentation 65 percent faster than single-stage processes, with a 50 percent higher gas
yield.
These developments show that sanitary engineers will be more concerned than ever
with the environmental aspects of their designs. With the world population growing
steadily every year and the longer lifespan of older individuals, biogas and similar recov-
ery-conversion processes will become standard practice in every major country.
The data on biogas given above was reported in Chemical Engineering.

Calculation of Interest,
Principal, and Payments

Symbols and Abbreviations

General: With discrete compounding, i = interest rate per period, percent; n = number of
interest periods. With continuous compounding, y = nominal annual interest rate, percent;
interest period = 1 year.
Simple and compound interest—single payment: P = value of payment at beginning of
first interest period, also termed present worth of payment; S = value of payment at end of
wth interest period, also termed future value of payment.

Compound interest—uniform-payment series: R = sum paid at end of each interest pe-
riod for n periods; P = value of payments at beginning of first interest period, also termed
present worth of payments; S = value of payments at end of nth interest period, also
termed future value of payments.
Compound interest—uniform-gradient series: Rm = payment at end of mth interest pe-
riod; g = constant difference between given payment and preceding payment, also termed
gradient of series. Then Rm = RI + (m— l)g. Also, P and S have the same meaning as for
uniform-payment series.
Compound interest—uniform-rate series: Rm = payment at end of mth interest period;
r = constant ratio of given payment to preceding payment. Then Rm = R^"1'1, and P and S
have the same meaning as for uniform-payment series.
Compound-interest factors: Single payment—SIP = single-payment compound-
amount (SPCA) factor; PIS = single-payment present-worth (SPPW) factor. Uniform-
payment series—SIR = uniform-series compound-amount (USCA) factor; RfS = sinking-
fund-payment (SFP) factor; PIR = uniform-series present-worth (USPW) factor; RIP =
capital-recovery (CR) factor. Uniform-rate series—S/Ri = uniform-rate-series compound-
amount (URSCA) factor; PIR1 = uniform-rate-series present-worth (URSPW) factor.

DETERMINATION OF SIMPLE INTEREST

A company borrows $4000 at 6 percent per annum simple interest. What payment must
be made to retire the debt at the end of 5 years?

Calculation Procedure:

Apply the equation for simple interest

This equation is S = P(I + ni) = $4000(1 + 5 x 0.06) = $5200.
Note: See the introduction to this section for the symbols used.

COMPOUND INTEREST; FUTURE VALUE OF
SINGLEPAYMENT

The sum of $2600 was deposited in a fund that earned interest at 8 percent per annum
compounded quarterly. What was the principal in the fund at the end of 3 years?

Calculation Procedure:

1. Compute the true interest rate and number of interest periods

Since there are four interest periods per year, the interest rate i per period is i = 8 per-
cent/4 = 2 percent per period. With a 3-year deposit period, the number n of interest peri-
ods is n = 3 x 4 - 12.

2. Apply the SPCA value given in a compound-interest table

Look up the SPCA value for the interest rate, 2 percent, and the number of interest peri-
ods, 12. Then substitute in S = P(SPCA) = $2600(1.268) = $3296.80.

PRESENT WORTH OF SINGLE PAYMENT

On January 1 of a certain year, a deposit was made in a fund that earns interest at 6 per-
cent per annum. On December 3 1 ,7 years later, the principal resulting from this deposit
was $1082. What sum was deposited?

Calculation Procedure:

Apply the SPPW relation

Obtain the SPPW factor for / = 6 percent, n = 1 years from the interest table. Thus P =
5(SPPW) = $1082(0.6651) = $719.64.

PRINCIPAL IN SINKING FUND

To accumulate capital for an expansion program, a corporation made a deposit of
$200,000 at the end of each year for 5 years in a fund earning interest at 4 percent per an-
num. What was the principal in the fund immediately after the fifth deposit was made?

Calculation Procedure:

Apply the USCA factor

Obtain the USCA factor for / = 4 percent, n = 5 from the interest table. Substitute in the
relation S = R(USCA) = $200,000(5.416) - $1,083,200.

DETERMINATION OF SINKING-FUND
DEPOSIT

The XYZ Corporation borrows $65,000, which it is required to repay at the end of 5 years
at 8 percent interest. To accumulate this sum, XYZ will make five equal annual deposits
in a fund that earns interest at 3 percent, the first deposit being made 1 year after negotia-
tion of the loan. What is the amount of the annual deposit required?

Calculation Procedure:

1. Compute the sum to be paid at the expiration of the loan

Obtain the SPCA factor from the interest table for / = 8 percent, n = 5. Then substitute in
the relation S = P(SPCA) = $65,000(1.469) = $95,485.

2. Compute the annual deposit corresponding to this future value

Obtain the SFP factor from the interest table for / = 3 percent, n = 5 and substitute in the
relation ^ - S(SFP) - $95,485(0.18835) = $17,985.

PRESENT WORTH OF A UNIFORM SERIES

An inventor is negotiating with two firms for assignment of rights to a patent. The ABC
Corp. offers an annuity of 12 annual payments of $15,000 each, the first payment to be
made 1 year after sale of the patent. The DEF Corp. proposes to buy the patent by making
an immediate lump-sum payment of $120,000. If the inventor can invest the capital at 10
percent, which offer should be accepted?

Calculation Procedure:

Compute the present worth of the annuity, using an interest rate
of 10 percent

Obtain the USPW factor from an interest table for / = 10 percent, n = 12 and substitute in
the relation P = R(USPW) = $15,000(6.814) = $102,210. Since the DEF Corp. offered an
immediate payment of $120,000, its offer is more attractive than the offer made by ABC
Corp.

CAPITAL-RECOVERY DETERMINATION

On January 1 of a certain year a company had a bank balance of $58,000. The company
decided to allot this money to an improvement program by making a series of equal pay-
ments 4 times a year for 5 years, beginning on April 1 of the same year. If the account
earned interest at 4 percent compounded quarterly, what was the amount of the periodic
payment?

Calculation Procedure:

1. Compute the true interest rate and number of interest periods

Since the annual rate = 4 percent and there are four interest periods per year, the rate per
period is / = 4 percent/4 = 1 percent. And with a 5-year pay period, the number of interest
periods = 5 years (4 periods per year) = 20 periods.

2. Compute the uniform payment, i.e., capital recovery

The present worth of the sum is $58,000. Obtain the CR factor from an interest table for /
= 1 percent, n = 20 and substitute in the relation R = P(CR) = $58,000(0.05542) =
$3214.36.

EFFECTIVE INTEREST RATE

An account earns interest at the rate of 6 percent per annum, compounded quarterly.
Compute the effective interest rate to four significant figures.

Calculation Procedure:

Compute the interest earned by $1 per year

With four interest periods per year, the interest rate per period = / = 6 percent/4 =1 .5 per-
cent. In 1 year there are four interest periods for this account.
Find the compounded value of $1 at the end of 1 year from S = (1 + i)n = (1 + 0.015)4
= $1.06136. Thus, the interest earned by $1 in 1 year = $106136 - 1.00,000 = $0.06136.
Hence, the effective interest rate = 6.136 percent.

PERPETUITY DETERMINATION

What sum must be deposited to provide annual payments of $10,000 that are to continue
indefinitely if the endowment fund earns interest of 4 percent compounded semiannually?

Calculation Procedure:

1. Compute the effective interest rate

Using the same procedure as in the previous calculation procedure for $1, we find the ef-
fective interest rate ie = (1.02)2 - 1 = 0.04040, or 4.04 percent.

2. Apply the USPW relation

The endowment or principal required = P = payment//e, or P = $10,000/0.0404 =
$247,525.

DETERMINATION OF EQUIVALENT SUMS

Jones Corp. borrowed $900 from Brown Corp. on January 1 of year 1 and $1200 on Janu-
ary 1 of year 3. Jones Corp. made a partial payment of $700 on January 1 of year 4. It was
agreed that the balance of the loan would be discharged by two payments, one on January
1 of year 5 and the other on January 1 of year 6, with the second payment being 50 per-
cent larger than the first. If the interest rate is 6 percent, what is the amount of each pay-
ment?

Calculation Procedure:

1. Construct a line diagram indicating the loan data

Figure 1 shows the line diagram for these loans and is typical of the diagrams that can be
prepared for any similar set of loans.

2. Select a convenient date for evaluating all the sums

For this situation, select January 1 of year 6. Mark the valuation date on Fig. 1, as shown.

3. Evaluate each sum at the date selected

Use the applicable interest rate, 6 percent, and the equivalence equation, value of money
borrowed = value of money paid. Substituting the applicable SPCA factor from the inter-
est table for each of the interest periods involved, o rw = 5 ,« = 3 ,w = 2, and n — 1, respec-
tively, gives $900(SPCA) + $1200(SPCA) = $700(SPCA) + jc(SPCA) + 1.5*, where

FIGURE 1. Time, receipt, and payment diagram.

x = payment made on January 1 of year 5 and 1.5* = payment made on January 1 of year
6. Substituting, we get $900(1.338) + $1200(1.191) = $700(1.124) + 1.06* + 1.5*; x =
$721.30. Hence, 1.5* = $1081.95.
Related Calculations: Note that this procedure can be used for more than two
loans and for payments of any type that retire a debt.

ANALYSIS OFA NONUNIFORM SERIES

On January 1 of a certain year, ABC Corp. borrowed $1,450,000 for 12 years at 6 percent
interest. The terms of the loan obliged the firm to establish a sinking ftind in which the
following deposits were to be made: $200,000 at the end of the second to the sixth years;
$250,000 at the end of the seventh to the eleventh years; and one for the balance of the
loan at the end of the twelfth year. The interest rate earned by the sinking fund was 3 per-
cent. Adverse financial conditions prevented the firm from making the deposit of
$200,000 at the end of the fifth year. What was the amount of the final deposit?

Calculation Procedure:

1. Prepare a money-time diagram

Figure 2 shows a money-time diagram for this situation, where * = deposit made at end of
twelfth year.

2. Compute the principal of the loan at the end of the twelfth year

Use the relation S = P(SPCA) for i = 6 percent, n = 12. Obtain the SPCA value from an
interest table, and substitute in the above relation, or S= $1,450,000(2.012) = $2,917,400.

All sums (except x) in units of $1000

Year

FIGURE 2. Money-time diagram.

3. Set up an expression for the principal In the sinking fund at the
end of the twelfth year

From Fig. 2, principal = $200,000(USCA, n = S)(SPCA, n = 8) + $200,000(SPCA, n = 6)
+ $250,000(USCA, n = S)(SPCA, n = 1) + x. With an interest rate of 3 percent, principal
= $200,000(3.091)(1.267) + $200,000(1.194) + $250,000(5.309)(1.030) + x, or principal
= $2,389,100+ jc.

4. Compute the final deposit

Equate the principal in the sinking fund to the principal of the loan: $2,389,100 + x =
$2,917,400. Thus, jc = $528,300.

UNIFORM SERIES WITH PAYMENT PERIOD
DIFFERENT FROM INTEREST PERIOD

Deposits of $2000 each were made in a fund earning interest at 4 percent per annum com-
pounded quarterly. The interval between deposits was 18 months. What was the balance
in the account immediately after the fifth deposit was made?

Calculation Procedure:

1. Compute the actual interest rate

Replace the interest rate I3 for the quarterly period with an equivalent rate /18 for the 18-
month period. Or, I18 = (1 +13)" - 1 = (1.01)6 - 1 = 6.15 percent.

2. Compute the USCA value

Apply the equation USCA = [(I + /)" - 1]/*, or USCA - [(1.0615)5 - 1]/0.0615 = 5.654.

3. Compute the principal in the fund

Use the relation S = /2(USCA) = $2000(5.654) = $11,308.

UNIFORM-GRADIENT SERIES: CONVERSION
TO UNIFORM SERIES

A loan was to be amortized by a group of six end-of-year payments forming an ascending
arithmetic progression. The initial payment was to be $5000, and the difference between
successive payments was to be $400, as shown in Fig. 3. But the loan was renegotiated to

FIGURE 3. Diagram showing changed payment plan.

provide for the payment of equal rather than uniformly varying sums. If the interest rate
of the loan was 8 percent, what was the annual payment?

Calculation Procedure:

1. Apply the equivalent-uniform-series equation

Let R1 = initial payment in a uniform-gradient series; g = difference between successive
payments; n = number of payments; Re = periodic payment in an equivalent uniform se-
ries. Then R6 = R1 +

form a geometric progression (i.e., the ratio of a given payment to the preceding payment
is constant). In this instance, the deposits form a uniform-rate series because each deposit
is 1.25 times the preceding deposit. Apply Eq. 8: URSCA = [r" - (1 + /)"]/(> - / - 1),
where r = ratio of given payment to preceding payment, n = number of payments, and i =
interest rate for the payment period. With r = 1.25, n = 8, and i = 7 percent, URSCA =
[(1.25)8 - (1.07)8]/(1.25 - 0.07 - 1) = 23.568.

2. Compute the future value of the set of deposits

Use the relation S = ^1(URSCA), where ^1 = first payment. Then S = $1000(23.568) =
$23,568.

DETERMINATION OF PAYMENTS UNDER
UNIFORM-RATE SERIES

At the beginning of year 1, the sum of $30,000 was borrowed with interest at 9 percent
per annum. The loan will be discharged by payments made at the end of years 1 to 6, in-
clusive, and each payment will be 95 percent of the preceding payment. Find the amount
of the first and sixth payments.

Calculation Procedure:

1. Compute the URSPW value of the uniform-rate series

Apply Eq. 9: URSPW = {[r/(l + i)]n - 1 }/(r - i - 1), where the symbols are as defined in
the previous calculation procedure. With r = 0.95, n = 6, and i = 9 percent, URSPW =
[(0.95/1.09)6 - 1]/(0.95 - 0.09 - 1) - 4.012.

2. Find the amount of the first payment

Use the relation P = ,K1(URSPW), where ^1 = first payment. Then $30,000 = /^(4.012),
or #! = $7477.60.

3. Find the amount of the sixth payment

Use the relation Rm = Rf "^1, where Rm = mth payment. Then ^6 = $7477.60(0.95)5 =
$5786.00.

CONTINUOUS COMPOUNDING

If $1000 is invested at 6 percent per annum compounded continuously, what will it
amount to in 5 years?

Calculation Procedure:

Apply the continuous compounding equation

Use the relation SPCA - e>n, where e = base of the natural logarithm system = 2.71828
. . ., j = nominal interest rate, n = number of years. Substituting gives SPCA = (2.718)°30
- 1.350. ThCnS = P(SPCA) = $1000(1.350) = $1350.

FUTURE VALUE OF UNIFORM SERIES
WITH CONTINUOUS COMPOUNDING

An inventor received a royalty payment of $25,000 at the end of each year for 7 years.
The royalties were invested at 12 percent per annum compounded continuously. What
was the inventor's capital at the expiration of the 7-year period?

Calculation Procedure:

1. Compute the USCA value

Apply Eq. 12: USCA - (ejn - V)I(ef- 1), where n - number of annual payments in uni-
form-payment series and e and j are as defined in the previous calculation procedure.
Thus, with /i = 7 andy = 12 percent, USCA = (e0-84 - l)/(e°-12 - 1) = 10.325.

2. Compute the future value of the series

Set S = ,R(USCA) = $25,000(10.325) = $258,100.
Related Calculations: Note that if interest were compounded annually at 12 per-
cent, the USCA value would be 10.089.

PRESENT WORTH OF CONTINUOUS CASH
FLOW OF UNIFORM RATE

An investment syndicate is contemplating purchase of a business that is expected to yield
an income of $200,000 per year continuously and at a constant rate for the next 5 years. If
the syndicate wishes to earn 18 percent on its investment, what is the maximum price it
should offer for the business?

Calculation Procedure:

1. Compute the present-worth factor

Apply the equation CFPW = (1 - e~Jn)/j, where CFPW = present-worth factor for a contin-
uous cash flow of uniform rate and n = number of years of the flow. Where the cash flow
is continuous, it is understood that the given interest or investment rate is based on contin-
uous compounding. Thus, with n = 5 and 7 = 18 percent, CFPW = (1 - £T°-90)/0.18 =
3.297.

2. Compute the present worth of the income

Set P = jR(CFPW), where R = annual cash-flow rate. Then P = $200,000(3.297) =
$659,400.

FUTURE VALUE OF CONTINUOUS CASH
FLOWOFUNIFORMRATE

The sum of $30 will be invested daily in a venture that yields 14 percent per annum. What
will be the accumulated capital at the expiration of 18 months?

Calculation Procedure:

1. Compute the cash-flow rate

Where money is invested daily, the cash flow may be considered to be continuous for all
practical purposes. Assume that deposits are made every day of the year. The cash-flow
rate R = $30(365) = $10,950 per year.

2. Compute the future-value factor

Apply the equation CFFV - (ejn - I)Ij9 where CFFV = future-value factor for a continu-
ous cash flow of uniform rate. Thus, with n = 1.5 and j = 14 percent, CFFV = (e021 -
1)70.14=1.669.

3. Compute the future value of the money invested

SetS = R(CWV) = $10,950(1.669) = $18,280.

Depreciation and Depletion

Notational System

Here D17 = depreciation charge for Uth year; D = annual depreciation; ^D17 = cumulative
depreciation at end of Uth year = D1 + D2 + D3 + • • • + DUy where the subscript numbers
refer to the year numbers; P0 = original cost of asset; P11 = book value of asset at end of
Uth year = P0- 2,D17; IRS = Internal Revenue Service; L = salvage value; W = wearing
value, or total depreciation = P0 -

STRAIGHT-LINE DEPRECIATION
WITH TWO RATES

An asset having an initial cost of $30,000 has a life expectancy of 15 years and an esti-
mated salvage value of $5000. What are the depreciation charges under a modified
straight-line method in which 60 percent of the total depreciation is considered to occur
during the first 5 years of the life of the asset?

Calculation Procedure:

1. Proportion the total wearing value of the asset

Divide the asset's life span into the two specified intervals, and proportion the total wear-
ing value between them. Thus, W= $30,000 - $5000 = $25,000; N= 15; W1 = first-period
wearing value = 0.60($25,000) = $15,000; W2 = second-period wearing value =
0.40($25,000) = $10,000.

2. Compute the annual depreciation charge

For the first 5 years, D = $15,000/5 = $3000. For the next 10 years, D = $10,000/10 =
$1000.

DEPRECIATION BYACCELERATED COST
RECOVERY SYSTEM

An asset having a first cost of $120,000 is to be depreciated by the Accelerated Cost Re-
covery System (ACRS). This asset is assigned a 5-year cost-recovery period, and the fol-
lowing depreciation factors are to be applied: year 1, 20.0 percent; year 2, 32.0 percent;
year 3, 19.2 percent; years 4 and 5, 11.5 percent; year 6, 5.8 percent. Compute the depre-
ciation charges and the book value of the asset during the cost-recovery period.

Calculation Procedure:

1. Compute the depreciation charges

The ACRS for allocating depreciation was adopted by the federal government in 1981,
but it subsequently underwent several modifications. ACRS was designed to allow a firm
to write off an asset rapidly, the expectation being that industry would thus be encouraged
to modernize its plants and facilities.
The salient features of ACRS are as follows: Each asset is assigned a cost-recovery
period during which depreciation is to be charged, and this period is independent of its es-
timated longevity; the estimated salvage value is ignored; the depreciation for a given
year is computed by multiplying the first cost of the asset by a specified depreciation fac-
tor; the initial depreciation charge occurs in the year the asset is placed in service, and the
depreciation charge for that year is independent of the specific date at which this place-
ment occurs. Since many assets are placed in service relatively late in the year, the allow-
able depreciation charge for the first year is low compared with that for the second year,

and depreciation is charged for one year beyond the cost-recovery period. If the salvage
value that accrues from disposal of the asset exceeds the book value of the asset at that
date, the excess is subject to taxation.
The depreciation charges are recorded in the accompanying table.

2. Compute the end-of-year book values

The results are recorded in the accompanying table. Currently, the federal government
recognizes only the straight-line method and ACRS for allocating depreciation. However,
many state governments still recognize other methods. Moreover, a firm may wish to
compute depreciation by some other method for its private records as a means of obtain-
ing a more accurate appraisal of its annual profit.

SINKING-FUND METHOD:
ASSETBOOK VALUE

A factory constructed at a cost of $9,000,000 has an anticipated salvage value of
$400,000 at the end of 30 years. What is the book value of this factory at the end of the
tenth year if depreciation is charged by the sinking-fund method with an interest rate of 5
percent?

Calculation Procedure:

1. Compute the cumulative depreciation

This method of depreciation accounting assumes that when the asset is retired, it is re-
placed by an exact duplicate and that replacement capital is accumulated by making uni-
form end-of-year deposits in a reserve fund. The cumulative depreciation ^Dv is there-
fore equated to the principal in the fund at the end of the Uth year. Or, ^Dv =
JF(SFPXUSCA). So W = $9,000,000 - $400,000 = $8,600,000, SFP = 0.01505 for
30 years, ( 7 - 10 years, and i = 5 percent, SAo = $8,600,000(0.01505)(12.578) =
$1,628,000.

2. Compute the book value

At the end of 10 years, the book value P10 = PQ- SZ)10 = $9,000,000 - $1,628,000 =
$7,372,000.

SINKING-FUND METHOD:
DEPRECIATION CHARGES

An asset costing $20,000 is expected to remain serviceable for 5 years and to have a sal-
vage value of $3000. Compute the depreciation charges, using the sinking-fund method
and an interest rate of 4 percent.

Calculation Procedure:

1. Compute the annual sinking-fund payment

Use the relation R = JF(SFP). With W= $20,000 - $3000 - $17,000, N= 5 years, and i =
4 percent, SFP = 0.18463. Then R = $17,000(0.18463) = $3139.

2. Compute the annual depreciation charges

Use the relation D17 = R(SPCA), or D1 = $3139(1.000) = $3139; D2 = $3139(1.040) =
$3265; D3 = $3139(1.082) = $3396; D4 = $3139(1.125) = $3531; D5 = $3139(1.170) =
$3673. Then SD5 = $17,004.

FIXED-PERCENTAGE (DECLINING-
BALANCE) METHOD

An asset cost $5000 and has a life expectancy of 6 years and an estimated salvage value
of $800. Construct a depreciation schedule for this asset, using the fixed-percentage
method.

Calculation Procedure:

1. Compute the rate of depreciation

Use the relation h = 1 - (L/P0)l/N, where h = rate of depreciation. Substituting gives h = 1
- (800/5000)1/6 - 0.2632, or 26.32 percent.

2. Compute the end-of-year book value

Use the relation D1 = hP0 = 0.2632($5000) = $1316. Then P1=P0-D1 = $5000 - $1316
= $3684. Likewise, D2 = 0.2632($3684) = $969.63; P2 = $3684 - $969.63 = $2714.37. In
a similar manner, D3 = $714.42, P3 = $1999.95, D4 = $526.39, P4 = $1473.56, D5 =
$387.84, P5 = $1085.72, D6 = $285.76, P6 = $799.96.

COMBINATION OF FIXED-PERCENTAGE
AND STRAIGHT-LINE METHODS

An asset cost $20,000 and has a life of 8 years and a salvage value of $1000. The IRS per-
mits use of the double-declining-balance method to charge depreciation. Compute the de-
preciation charges.

Calculation Procedure:

1. Compute the rate of depreciation

Under the double-declining-balance method, depreciation is initially charged on a fixed-
percentage basis, with 2IN as the rate of depreciation. Thus, rate of depreciation = 2/8 =
0.25, or 25 percent.

2. Compute the depreciation charge for each year by the
fixed-percentage method

For the first year, depreciation charge = 0.25($20,000) = $5000. Then the book value at
the end of the first year = $20,000 - $5000 = $15,000. Following this procedure, construct
Table 1.

3. Compute the depreciation for the transfer study

Assume that the transfer in depreciation accounting from the fixed-percentage to the
straight-line method is made at the end of a particular year. Calculate the annual depreci-
ation charge D' that applies for the remaining life of the asset.
For example, at the end of the third year the book value is $8437, and the depreciation
that remains to be charged during the last 5 years is $7437. Then D' = $7437/5 = $1487.
Record the values found in this manner in Table 1.

4. Determine the transfer date

To establish the transfer date, compare each value of D' with the depreciation charge that
will occur in the following year if the fixed-percentage method is used. This comparison
shows that the method should be revised at the end of the fifth year because after that time
the fixed-percentage method results in a smaller depreciation charge. The depreciation
charges (Table 1) are thus D1 = $5000; D2 = $3750; D3 = $2813; D4 = $2109; D5 = $1582;
D6 = D1 = D8 = $1249.

CONSTANT-UNIT-USE METHOD
OF DEPRECIATION

A machine cost $38,000 and has a life of 5 years and a salvage value of $800. The pro-
duction output of this machine in units per year is: first year, 2000; second year, 2500;

third year, 2250; fourth year, 1750; fifth year, 1500 units. If the depreciation is ascribable
to use rather than the effects of time, and the units produced are of uniform quality, what
are the annual depreciation charges?

Calculation Procedure:

1. Determine the depreciation charge per production unit

Proportion the wearing value on the basis of annual production. Since W = $38,000 -
$800 = $37,200 and 10,000 units are produced in 5 years, the depreciation charge per pro-
duction unit = $37,200/10,000 = $3.72.

2. Compute the annual depreciation charge

Since the annual depreciation charge is a function of the production rate, take the product
of the depreciation charge per production unit and the annual production. Or, D1 =
$3.72(2000) - $7440; D2 = $9300; D3 = $8370; D4 = $6510; D5 = $5580.

DECLINING-UNIT-USE METHOD
OFDEPRECIATION

Using the same data as in the previous calculation procedure, assume that depreciation
will be charged by weighting the units produced according to their relative quality. This
method reflects the quality loss resulting from increased use of the machine. The quality
weights assigned this machine are: first 4000 units produced, 2.0; next 3000 units, 1.5; re-
mainder, 1.0. Compute the depreciation charges for this machine.

Calculation Procedure:

1. Compute the number of depreciation units

The depreciation units are related to the annual production by applying the assigned qual-
ity rates. Thus

2. Proportion the wearing value

Consider the number of depreciation units as the criterion. Or, depreciation charge per de-
preciation unit = $37,200/15,500 = $2.40.

3. Compute the annual depreciation

Take the product of the depreciation charge per depreciation unit and the annual depreci-
ation units. Or, D1 = $2.40(4000) = $9600; likewise, D2 = $11,400; D3 = $8100; D4 =
$4500; D5 = $3600. Taking the sum of these charges, we see that the total depreciation =
$37,200.

SUM-OF-THE-DIGITS METHOD
OF DEPRECIATION

A machine costing $15,000 is expected to remain serviceable for 7 years. The machine
will have a salvage value of $1000. What are the annual depreciation charges based on the
sum-of-the-digits method?

Calculation Procedure:

1. Compute the machine wearing value

The wearing value W, or total depreciation = $15,000 - $1000 = $14,000.

2. Compute the annual depreciation

Use the relation Dv = W(N- U+ 1)/0.5 [#(#+ I)], where U= year number. Thus, for U=
1, D1 - $3500. Likewise, for U= 2, D2 = $3000; for U= 3, D3 = $2500; for U= 4, D4 =
$2000; for U= 5, D5 = $1500; for U= 6, D6 = $1000; for U= 7, D1 = $500.

COMBINATION OF TIME- AND
USE-DEPRECIATION METHODS

A machine cost $38,000 and has a life of 5 years and a salvage value of $800. Studies
show that one-third of the total depreciation stems from the effects of time and two-thirds
stems from use. Compute the annual depreciation charges if time depreciation is based on
sum of the digits and use depreciation on a production basis with all units of equal quali-
ty. Use the same production as in the third previous procedure.

Calculation Procedure:

1. Divide the wearing value into its two elements

Knowing the respective depreciation proportions, let the subscripts t and u refer to time
and use, respectively. Also, W = $38,000 - $800 = $37,200, and Wt = ^($37,200) =
$12,400; Wu = 2/3($37,200) = $24,800.

2. Compute the annual depreciation charge

For the first year, Dn = W1NI[N(N + 1/2] = $12,400(5)/[5(6/2)] - $4133. Also, Dul =
($24,800/10,000 units)(2000 units the first year) = $4960. Thus, the total depreciation for
the first year is D1 = $4133 + $4960 = $9093.

EFFECTS OF DEPRECIATION ACCOUNTING
ON TAXES AND EARNINGS

The QRS Corp. purchased capital equipment for use in a 5-year venture. The equipment
cost $240,000 and had zero salvage value. If the income tax rate was 52 percent and the
annual income from the investment was $83,000 before taxes and depreciation, what was
the average rate of earnings if the profits after taxes were invested in tax-free bonds yield-
ing 3 percent? Compare the results obtained when depreciation is computed by the
straight-line and sum-of-the-digits methods.

Calculation Procedure:

1. Compute the taxable income

With straight-line depreciation, the depreciation charge is $240,000/5 = $48,000 per year.
Then the taxable income = $83,000 - $48,000 = $35,000, because depreciation is fully
deductible from gross income.

2. Compute the annual tax payment

With a tax rate of 52 percent, the annual tax payment, excluding other deductions, is
0.52($35,000) = $18,200.

3. Compute the net income

The net cash income = gross income - tax payment, if there are no other expenses. Or, net
income = $83,000 - $18,200 = $64,800.

4. Determine the capital accumulated by investing the
net income in bonds

Use the USCA factor for j = 3 percent, n = 5 years. Or, S = tf (USCA) = $64,800(5.309) =
$344,000.

5. Compute the average earnings rate on the venture

Use the relation SPCA = (1 + /)", where SPCA = $344,000/$240,000 = (1+ O5 i = 7.47
percent.

6. Compute the sum-of-the-digits annual depreciation

Using the previously developed procedure for sum-of-the-digits depreciation charges
gives D1 = $80,000; D2 = $64,000; Z)3 = $48,000; D4 = $32,000; D5 = $16,000.

7. Compute the annual tax and net Income

Using the same method as in steps 2 and 3, we find the annual net income R is RI =
$81,440; ^2 - $73,120; ^3 = $64,800; ^4 = $56,480; R5 = $48,160.

8. Determine the capital accumulated

Use the respective SPCA values for i = 3 percent and years 1 through 5 for the income
earned in each year. Or, S = $81,440(1.126) + $73,120(1.093) + $64,800(1.061) +
$56,480(1.030) + $48,160 = $346,700.

B. Compare the average earnings rate on the venture

By the method of step 5, $346,700/$240,000 = (1 + O5; i = 7-63 percent.
The computed interest rates apply to a composite investment-the purchase and opera-
tion of the capital equipment and the purchase of bonds. The total income accruing from
the first element is $324,000, regardless of the depreciation method used. However, the
timing as well as the amount of this income is important.
The straight-line method produces a uniform annual depreciation charge, tax payment,
and net income. Under the sum-of-digits method, these amounts are nonuniform; the net

income is highest in the first year and then gradually declines. Therefore, the interest
earned through the purchase of bonds is higher if the firm adopts the sum-of-the-digits
method.
If the interest rate associated with the second element of this composite investment
had been higher, say 4 or 5 percent, the disparity between the two average returns would
have been correspondingly higher.

DEPLETION ACCOUNTING BY
THE SINKING-FUND METHOD

An oil field is anticipated to yield an annual income, before depletion allowances, of
$120,000. The field will be dry after 5 years, at which time the land will have a residual
value of $60,000. If a firm desires a return of 10 percent on its investment, what is the
maximum amount it should invest in this oil field? Use a 4 percent interest rate for the
sinking fund.

Calculation Procedure:

1. Determine the replacement cost of the asset

In this method of depletion accounting, it is assumed that the firm deposits a portion of
the annual income in a reserve fund to accumulate the capital needed to replace the asset.
Let C denote the investment required. Then the replacement cost r=C- $60,000 for this
venture.

2. Compute the annual deposit required

Let d = annual deposit required. Then d = r(SFP) for this venture, or any similar situation.
With i = 4 percent, n = 5, d= (C- $60,000)(0.18463) = 0.18463C- 11,077.80.

3. Compute the investment required

Set the residual income equal to 10 percent of the investment and solve for C. Or,
$120,000-(0.18463C- 11,077.80) = 0.1OC; C= $460,520.
Related Calculations: Note that this method can be applied to any situation
where there is a gradual depletion of a valuable, profit-generating asset. Further, 'the
method given here is homologous to the sinking-fund method of depreciation accounting.

INCOME FROM A DEPLETING ASSET

An oil field purchased for $800,000 is expected to be dry at the end of 4 years. If the re-
sale value of the land is $20,000, what annual income is required to yield an investment
rate of 8 percent? Use a sinking-fund rate of 3 percent.

Calculation Procedure:

1. Compute the annual deposit required to accumulate
the replacement capital

The replacement cost = $800,000 - $20,000 = $780,000 = r. Use the relation annual de-
posit d = r(SFP). With i = 3 percent, n = 4,d= $780,000(0.23903) = $186,440.

2. Compute the annual income required

Combine the annual return on the invested capital with the reserve-fund deposit to obtain
the required annual income from the asset. Or, annual return on investment =
0.08($800,000) = $64,000. Then the required annual income - $64,000 + $186,440 =
$250,440.

DEPLETION ACCOUNTING
BY THE UNIT METHOD

The sum of $500,000 was expended in purchasing and developing a mine. During the first
2 years, ore was extracted at these rates: first year, 20,000 tons; second year, 18,000 tons.
Originally, the mine was estimated to have a capacity of 230,000 tons, but at the begin-
ning of the second year the remaining capacity was estimated to be only 170,000 tons.
Compute the depletion allowance for the first 2 years by the unit method.

Calculation Procedure:

1. Compute the depletion allowance for the first year

Under the unit method, it is assumed that the entire capital invested in a depleting asset is
consumed in the venture, and the loss of capital is prorated over the life of the venture on
the basis of the amount of mineral extracted each year. Thus, for the first year, depletion =
$500,000(20,000/230,000) = $43,480.

2. Compute the depletion allowance for the second year

At the beginning of the second year, the unrecovered capital is $500,000 - $43,480 =
$456,520, and the estimated amount of ore remaining is 170,000 tons. Thus, for the sec-
ond year, depletion - $456,520(18,000/170,000) = $48,340.

Cost Comparisons of Alternative Proposals

Annual Cost

For analytical purposes, it is desirable to convert the estimated costs associated with a
proposed scheme to an equivalent series of uniform annual payments. The annual pay-
ment thus obtained is termed the annual cost of the scheme. The interest rate applied in
making this conversion is the minimum investment rate that is considered acceptable by
the organization making the investment or incurring the costs.
Where alternative schemes are being evaluated on the basis of their annual cost, the
usual procedure is to exclude those expenses which are identical for all schemes, since
they do not affect the comparison.

Notational System

Here P = initial cost of asset acquired in the proposed scheme; L ~ salvage value of the as-
set; N= life of asset, years; J1 = interest rate; c = sum of annual costs of operation, main-
tenance, etc., that are assumed to remain constant for the asset life; A = annual cost -(P-
L)(CR) + Li1 + c, where CR is the capital-recovery factor from the compound-interest ta-
bles for / = / ! ,« = Af; other symbols are as defined earlier. Also, A = (P- L)(SFP) + Pi1 +
c, for the same interest and life as the above annual-cost relation.

DETERMINATION OFANNUAL COST

A firm contemplates building a new warehouse. A choice is to be made between a brick
and a galvanized-iron structure. The cost data associated with each structure are as fol-
lows:

Brick

If this firm earns 6 percent on its invested capital, which type of structure is the more
economical one?

Calculation Procedure:

1. Compute the operating and maintenance costs

For the brick building, the annual operating and maintenance cost = c = maintenance cost
per year, $ + annual taxes, $ + annual insurance cost, $, or $1000 +• 0.013($80,000) +
0.002($80,000) = $2200.
For the galvanized-iron building, c = $2300 + 0.013($36,000) + 0.005($36,000) =
$2948.

2. Compute the annual cost of each building

Use the capital-recovery equation. Thus, for the brick building, A = ($80,000 -
$15,000)(0.06646) + $15,000)(0.06) + $2200 = $7420.
For the galvanized-iron building, A = ($36,000 - $4000)(0.10296) + $4000(0.06) +
$2948 = $6483.
Since the galvanized-iron building has a lower annual cost, it is the more economical
structure.
Related Calculations: This general method of computing annual costs can be
used for any number of industrial or commercial assets regardless of whether they are sta-
tionary, moving, or water- or air-borne. The key fact is that accurate costs are required if
the annual cost comparison is to have validity.

MINIMUM ASSET LIFE TO JUSTIFY
A HIGHER INVESTMENT

The timber floor of a bridge is to be replaced, and consideration is being given to treating
the timber to prolong its life and reduce maintenance costs. An untreated timber floor
costs $5000 and has an annual maintenance cost of $500 and a life of 10 years. A treated
timber floor costs $8500 and has an annual maintenance cost of $300. How long should
the treated timber last to make it more economical than the untreated timber? Use an in-
terest rate of 5 percent.

Calculation Procedure:

1. Compute the annual cost of the untreated timber floor

Using the capital-recovery factor, we see the annual cost is $5000(0.12950) + $500 =
$1147.50.

2. Set up an expression for the annual cost of the
treated timber floor

The annual cost is $8500(CR) + $300.

3. Compute the minimum life required to justify
treating the timber

Equate the annual costs, giving $8500(CR) + $300 = $1147.50, or CR = 0.09971. Interpo-
lating in the compound-interest table for 5 percent, we find N= 14.3 years. The life of the
treated timber floor must exceed 14.3 years to make it more economical.

COMPARISON OF EQUIPMENT COST
AND INCOME GENERATED

A firm is considering purchasing equipment that will reduce annual labor costs by $4000.
The equipment costs $30,000 and has a salvage value of $5000 and a life of 7 years. The
annual maintenance cost is $600. While not in use by the firm, the equipment can be rent-
ed to others to generate an income of $1000 per year. If money can be invested for an 8
percent return, is the firm justified in buying the equipment?

Calculation Procedure:

1. Compute the annual cost of using the equipment

Using the capital-recovery-factor annual cost, we get A = ($30,000 - $5000)(0.19207) +
$5000(0.08) + $600 = $5802.

2. Compute the annual cost of not purchasing the equipment

If the equipment is not purchased, the firm will incur an extra labor cost of $4000 over
that with the equipment. Also, the rental income that would be obtained from the equip-
ment will be lost. Hence, the total annual cost without the equipment would be A = $4000
+ $1000 = $5000.
Since the annual cost with the equipment would be $5802, the firm should not pur-
chase the equipment because without it the annual cost is only $5000.

SELECTION OF RELEVANT DATA
IN ANNUAL-COST STUDIES

An existing factory must be enlarged or replaced to accommodate new production ma-
chinery. The structure was built at a cost of $130,000. Its present book value, based on
straight-line depreciation, is $35,000, but it has been appraised at $40,000. If the struc-
ture is altered, the cost will be $80,000 and its service life will be extended 8 years, with
a salvage value of $30,000. A new factory could be purchased for $250,000. It would
have a life of 20 years and a salvage value of $35000. Annual maintenance costs of the
new building would be $8000, compared with $5000 in the enlarged structure. Howev-
er, the improved layout in the new building would reduce annual production costs by
$12,000. All other expenses for the two structures are estimated as being equal. Using
an investment rate of 8 percent, determine which is the more attractive investment for
this firm.

Calculation Procedure:

1. Segregate the relevant data for the existing structure

Relevant data-present resale value. Irrelevant data-cost of construction and present book
value.

2. Record the pertinent cost data for each scheme

Classify the income that would accrue from one scheme as a "cost" of its alternative.

3. Compute the annual cost of the enlarged building

Using the capital-recovery factor for Z1 = 8 percent, n = 8 years, we have A = ($120,000 -
$30,0,000)(0.17401) + $30,000(0.08) + $5000 + $12,000 = $35,061.

4. Compute the annual cost of the new building

Using the capital-recovery factor for / = 8 percent, n = 20 years gives A = ($250,000 -
$35,000)(0.10185) + $35,000(0.08) + $8000 = $32,698.
Since the new building has an annual cost almost $2400 less than the enlarged existing
structure, the new building is the more economical choice.
Related Calculations: This general procedure can be used to compare any two
or more alternatives having characteristics similar to those described above.

DETERMINATION OF MANUFACTURING
BREAK-EVEN POINT

A manufacturing firm has a choice between two machines to produce a product. The rele-
vant data are as follows:

Machine A 

Machine B

First cost, $ 
Salvage value, $ 
Life, years 
Annual operating cost, $ 

20,000 
2,000

3,000 + 5.00 per unit 

28,000

6
2,500 + 1.50 per unit

If money is worth 7 percent, what annual production is required to justify purchase of ma-
chine B?

Calculation Procedure:

1. Compute the annual cost of the first machine

Let x denote the number of units produced annually. Then, by using the capital-recovery
factor, A = ($20,000 - $2000)(0.14238) + $2000(0.07) + $3000 + 5* = $5703 + 5* for ma-
chine A.

2. Compute the annual cost of the second machine

Using the same procedure for machine B gives A = ($28,000)(0.20980) + $2500 + 1.5* =
$8374+1.5*.

3. Equate the annual costs, and solve for the unknown

Substituting the annual costs from steps 1 and 2 yields $5703 + 5jc = $8374 + 1.5*; x =
763 units.
This is the break-even point at which the costs of each machine are equal. If produc-
tion is expected to exceed this volume, machine B is the economical choice.

For machine A, the estimated annual operating cost is $1240. For machine B, it is $800
for the first 4 years, $1200 for the next 3 years, and $1500 for the remaining 3 years. De-
termine which machine is more economical, using an 8 percent interest rate.

Year

FIGURE 4. Annual operating costs for machine B.

Calculation Procedure:

1. Compute the annual cost of machine A

By using the capital-recovery factor, A = $6800(0.21632) + $1240 = $2711.

2. Construct a money-time diagram for machine B

Figure 4 shows the annual operating costs for machine B.

3. Convert the operating costs for machine B to an equivalent
uniform series

The value S of these costs as of the end of the tenth year is S = $800(USCA, n = 4)(SPCA,
TI = 6) + $1200(USCA, n = 3)(SPCA, n = 3) + $1500(USCA, n = 3), or S = $800(4.506)
(1.587) + $1200(3.246)(1.260) + $1500(3.246) = $15,498. Now apply the relationship R
= S(SFP, n = 10), where R = annual payment of a uniform series that is equivalent to the
actual operating costs. Then R = $15,498(0.06903) = $1070. This is the equivalent uni-
form annual operating cost for machine B.

4. Compute the annual cost of machine B, and compare the
two machines

Using the capital-recovery factor, we find A = ($12,000 - $100O)(0.14903) + $1000(0.08)
+ $1070 = $2789. Machine A has a lower annual cost, and so it is more economical.
Related Calculations: As an alternative method in step 3, compute the value P'
of the operating costs as of the purchase date. Then P' = $800(USPW, n = 4) +
$1200(USPW, n = 3)(SPPW, n = 4) + $1500(USPW, n = 3)(SPPW, n = 7), or P' =
$800(3.312) + $1200(2.577)(0.7350) + $1500(2.577)(0.583) = $7176. Now apply the re-
lationship R = /"(CR, TI = 10), or R = $7176(0.14903) = $1069. Note that the arithmetic
mean of the annual operating costs for machine B is $1130. However, since the costs in-
crease with time and the earlier payments in a series have a more pronounced effect than
the later payments, the equivalent annual operating cost is less than $1130.

If the cost of a new machine remained constant during this time, at what date would it be
most economical to replace the machine with a duplicate? Use a 7 percent interest rate.

Calculation Procedure:

1. Compute the present worth of all payments on the asset

Let P' denote the present worth (i.e., the value at the date of purchase) of all expenditures
ascribable to an asset. In the capital-recovery annual-cost equation, substitute P' for P and
set c = O to obtain the following alternative equation: A = (P' - L)(CR) + Li1. Using I1 = 7
percent, compute the present worth of the operating costs. Or,

PW = ($4800)(0.7629) = $3662
PW = ($6800)(0.7130) = $4848

2. Determine the present worth for each life span

found in step 1. Or,

P' = $14,334 ± $2,694 = $17,028
P' = $17,028 + $3,662 = $20,690
P' = $20,690 + $4,848 = $25,538

A = $13,828(0.38105) + $3,200(0.07) = $5,493
A = $18,190(0.29523) + $2,500(0.07) = $5,545
A = $23,538(0.24389) + $2,000(0.07) = $5,881

Inspect these annual costs to determine when the minimum annual cost occurs. Since the
annual cost is a minimum when TV = 3, the asset should be retired at the end of the third
year.

ANNUAL COSTBY THEAMORTIZATION
(SINKING-FUND-DEPRECIATIONUVIETHOD 

__^

A machine costs $30,000 and will be retired at the end of 8 years with a salvage value
of $5000. The annual operating cost is $3200. Determine the annual cost by the amorti-
zation method if the interest rate on the loan is 6 percent and that of the sinking fund is
3 percent.

Calculation Procedure:

Compute the annual cost of the asset

The amortization method is based on the following assumptions: The asset is purchased
with borrowed funds; interest on the loan is paid annually; the loan principal is paid as a
lump sum at the retirement of the asset; the funds required to retire the debt are accumu-
lated by uniform annual deposits in a reserve fund. This assumed method of financing is
unrealistic; the amortization method is therefore approximate.
Let I1 = interest rate on loan; I2 = interest rate on sinking fund. Then A = (P- L)(SFP)
+ Pii + c. In this equation the SFP factor is based on I2. Apply this equation, using P =
$30,000, L = $5000, TV= 8, c = $3200,11 = 6 percent, /2 = 3 percent. Thus, A = $7812.

ANNUAL COST BY THE
STRAIGHT-LINE-DEPRECIATION METHOD

The director of a corporation recommends that a firm buy a computer instead of renting at
the rate of $50 per hour. A new computer costs $120,000; annual operating, maintenance,
and insurance costs total $8500. The computer will be traded at the end of 10 years for
$30,000. The director forecasts computer usage for 480 h/year. He bases his calculation
of annual cost on the straight-line-depreciation method with an interest rate of 6 percent.
Is his recommendation sound?

Calculation Procedure:

1. Compute the annual cost of owning the asset

The straight-line method is an approximate one which assumes that the asset is purchased
with borrowed funds. However, the method disregards the timing of payments and con-
siders only their arithmetic average. Thus, the annual cost A = (P- L)IN +(P- L)I1(N +
l)/2N + Li1 + c. So A = $90,000/10 + $90,000(0.06)(11/20) + $30,000(0.06) + $8500 =
$22,270.

2. Compute the annual cost of renting the asset

The annual cost of renting the asset = (hourly rate, $)(annual use, hr) = ($50)(480) =
$24,000.
Since the annual cost of owning the asset is less than the annual cost of renting it,
the firm would save money by owning the asset. Note that this is an approximate
method.

Present Worth of Future Costs

A cost analysis of alternative schemes may be performed by computing the present worth
of all expenses incurred in each scheme during a stipulated period called the analysis pe-
riod. This period should encompass an integral number of lives of each asset required un-
der the alternative schemes.

PRESENT WORTH OF FUTURE COSTS OF
ANINSTALLATION

A city contemplates increasing the capacity of existing water-transmission lines. Two
plans are under consideration: Plan A requires construction of a parallel pipeline, flow be-
ing maintained by gravity. The initial cost is $800,000, and the life is 60 years with an an-
nual operating cost of $1000. Plan B requires construction of a booster pumping station
costing $210,000 with a life of 30 years. The pumping equipment costs an additional
$50,000; it has a life of 15 years and a salvage value of $10,000. The annual operating
cost is $35,000. Which is the more economical plan if the interest rate is 6 percent?

Calculation Procedure:

1. Construct a money-time diagram of the situation

Figure 5 shows the money-time diagram. Note that this diagram uses 60 years as the
analysis period. Record on the money-time diagram the capital expenditures during this
60-year period.

2. Compute the total present worth of the payments

For plan A, using the USPW factor for n = 60 years, we get PW = $800,000 +
$1000(16.161) = $816,160. For plan B, by using the SPPW factor for the payments
shown in Fig. 5, and the uniform series present-worth factor for the operating cost, PW =
$260,000 + $40,000(SPPW) + $250,000(SPPW) + $40,000(SPPW) + $35,000(USPW) -
$10,000(SPP W) - $260,000 + $40,000(0.4173) + $250,000(0.1741) + $40,000(0.0727) +
$35,000(16.161) - $10,000(0.0303) - $888,460.
Since the present worth of plan A is less than that of plan B, the scheme for plan A
should be adopted because it is more economical.

Capitalized Cost

In computing the present worth of the costs associated with a proposed scheme, it is often
advantageous to select an analysis period of infinite duration. The present worth of the fu-
ture costs is then referred to as the capitalized cost of the scheme.
Since each expenditure recurs indefinitely during the analysis period, the various costs
constitute a group of perpetuities. Thus, the capitalized cost C0 is Cc = [(P - L)^1](CR) +
L + CIi1, or C0 = [(P - L)U1](SFP) + P + CIi1.
If an asset is considered to have an infinite life span, these equations reduce to C0 = P
+ CIi1. In these equations, i = il9n= N.

DETERMINATION OF CAPITALIZED COST

Two methods of conveying water for an industrial plant are being analyzed. Method A
uses a tunnel, and method B a ditch and flume. The costs are as follows:

Method A

First cost, $ 
Salvage value, $ 
Life, years 
Operating cost, $/year 

Evaluate these two alternatives on the basis of capitalized cost, using a 5 percent interest
rate.

Calculation Procedure:

1. Compute the capitalized cost of the first alternative

Since the tunnel has an infinite life, C0 = P + CIi1 = $180,000 + $2300/0.05 = $226,000.

2. Compute the capitalized cost of the second alternative

Using the capital-recovery factor for n = 50 years, i = 5 percent, we find for the ditch C0 =
($50,000/0.05)(0.05478) + $2000/0.05 = $94,780.
Using a similar procedure for the flume, which has a 15-year life, gives C0 =
($35,000/0.05)(0.09634) + $5000 + $3600/0.05 = $144,440. The total capitalized cost for
method B = the sum of the flume and ditch costs, or $239,220. Since method A costs less,
it is more economical.

CAPITALIZED COST OFASSET WITH
UNIFORM INTERMITTENT PAYMENTS

What is the capitalized cost of a bridge costing $85,000 and hav ing-a 25-year life, a
$10,000 salvage value, $400 annual maintenance cost, and repairs at 5-year intervals of
$2000, if the interest rate is 5 percent?

Calculation Procedure:

1. Convert the assumed repair costs to an equivalent
series of uniform annual payments

Assume that the repairs are made at the end of every 5-year interval, including the re-
placement date. Using the SFP factor, we see the equivalent series of uniform annual pay-
ments R1 = $2000(SFP) for j = 5 percent, n = 5 years, O rU1 = $2000(0.18097) = $362.

2. Convert the true repair costs to an equivalent series of
uniform annual payments

Repairs are omitted when the bridge is scrapped at the end of 25 years, thereby saving
$2000 in the final 5-year period. Convert this amount to an equivalent series of uniform
annual payments (i.e., savings) and subtract from the result in step 1. Or, R2 =
$2000(SFP) for j = 5 percent, n = 25 years. Or, R2 = $2000(0.02095) = $42. Thus the an-
nual cost of the repairs = $362 - $42 = $320.

3. Compute the capitalized cost

Using the capital-recovery factor for / = 5 percent, n = 25 years, we get Cc =
($75,000/0.05)(0.07095) + $10,000 + $400/0.05 + $320/0.05 = $130,830.

Related Calculations'. An alternative solution could be worked as follows: Since
the $2000 saving at the end of every 25-year interval coincides in timing with the income
of $10,000 from the sale of the old bridge as scrap, this saving can be combined with the
salvage value to obtain an effective value of $12,000 for salvage. The annual cost of re-
pairs is therefore taken as $362, the value O fU1, step 1. Applying the capital-recovery fac-
tor gives C0 = [($85,000 - $12,000)/0.05](0.07095) + $12,000 + $400/0.05 + $362/0.05 =
$130,830. This agrees with the previously determined value.

CAPITALIZED COST OF AN ASSET WITH
NONUNIFORM INTERMITTENT PAYMENTS

A bridge has the same cost data as in the previous calculation procedure except for the re-
pairs, which are as follows:

End of year 

Repair cost, $

10 
15 
20 

2000
3500
1500

What is the capitalized cost of the bridge if the interest rate is 5 percent?

Calculation Procedure:

1. Compute the present worth of the repairs for one life span

Use the single-payment present-worth factor for each of the repair periods. Or, PW =
$2000(0.6139) + $3500(0.4810) + $1500(0.3769) = $3477.

2. Convert the result of step 1 to an equivalent series of uniform
annual payments

Using the capital-recovery factor, we find the annual cost of repairs = $3477(CR), where
i = 5 percent, n = 25 years. Or, ca = $3477(0.07095) = $247.

3. Compute the capitalized cost

Using the same method as in step 3 of the previous calculation procedure gives Cc =
$106,430 + $10,000 + $8000 + $247/0.05 = $129,370.
Related Calculations: An alternative way of solving this problem is to combine
the present worth of the payments for repairs ($3477) with the initial cost ($85,000) to ob-
tain an equivalent initial cost P'. Then, P' = $88,477, and P' -L = $88,477 - $10,000 =
$78,477. By applying the capital-recovery factor, Cc = $129,370 as before.

If money is worth 10 percent, which is the more economical plan?

Calculation Procedure:

1. Compute the total present worth of the second plan costs

Let P' represent the total present worth of the costs associated with plan B for one life
span. Using the SPPW for / = 10 percent, n = 10 years, for the cost of enlarging the struc-
ture, and the USPW for the annual maintenance after expansion, and the difference be-
tween the annual maintenance costs of this structure and the original structure, we get
P' = $80,000 + $40,000(0.3855) + $1800(9.427) - $600(6.144) = $108,700.

2. Compute the capitalized cost of each alternative

Using the capital-recovery factor for plan A with i = 10 percent, n = 25 years yields C0 =
[($100,000 - $10,000)/0.10](0.11017) + $10,000 + $1400/0.10 = $123,150.
For plan B, by using the present worth from step 1, Cc = [($108,700 -
$15,000)/0.10](0.10608) + $15,000 = $114,400. Note that the capital-recovery factor for
plan B is for 30 years.
Since plan B has the lower capitalized cost, it is more economical.

Cost Comparisons with Taxation and Technological Advances

In the preceding material, the costs of alternative proposals were compared by disregard-
ing taxation and assuming that financial and technological conditions remain static. The
cost analysis is now made more realistic by including the effects of taxation and techno-
logical advances. Later the effects of inflation also are included.

CALCULATION OFANNUAL COST
ON AFTER-TAX BASIS

An asset has the following cost data: First cost, $80,000; life, 10 years; salvage value,
$5000; annual operating cost, $3600. The firm that owns the asset is subject to a tax rate
of 47 percent, and its investment rate is 8 percent after payment of taxes. Compute the
after-tax annual cost of this asset if depreciation is allocated by (a) the straight-line
method and (b) the sum-of-digits method.

Calculation Procedure:

1. Compute the annual depreciation charge
under the straight-line method

The charge is D = ($80,000 - $5000)710 = $7500.

2. Compute the annual cost under straight-line depreciation

Most income earned by a corporation is subject to the payment of corporate income tax.
The effective (or after-tax) income is the difference between the original income and the
tax payment pertaining to that income. The before-tax investment rate ib = rate of return
on an investment as calculated on the basis of original income; the after-tax investment
rate ia = rate of return as calculated on the basis of effective income. Every cost incurred
in operating an asset serves to reduce taxable income and thus the tax payment. The effec-
tive cost is the difference between the actual expenditure and the tax savings that results
from the expenditure. The cost of an asset is said to be computed on an after-tax basis if
all calculations are based on effective costs and the after-tax investment rate.
Let t = tax rate and D = annual depreciation charge. Where annual operating costs and
depreciation charges are uniform, the annual cost A = (P — Z)(CR, n = N9 i = ia) + Li0 +
c ( l - 0~ Dt. The last term represents the tax savings that accrues from the depreciation
charge. With n = 10, ia = 8 percent, and t = 47 percent, A = ($80,000 - $5000)(0.14903) +
$5000(0.08) + $3600(0.53) - $7500(0.47) = $9960.

3. Compute the annual depreciation charges
under the sum-of-digits method

As given in an earlier calculation procedure, DU — W(N- U+ 1)/0.5[W(W+ I)], where Dv
= depreciation charge for t/th year and W= total depreciation. With W= $75,000 and W=
10, Z)1 = $13,636, and every depreciation charge thereafter is $1363.64 less than the pre-
ceding charge.

4. Convert the depreciation charges under the sum-of-digits
method to an equivalent uniform depreciation charge,
using an 8 percent interest rate

Refer to an earlier calculation procedure for converting a uniform-gradient series
to an equivalent uniform series. The equivalent uniform depreciation charge D = D1 +

(g/0(l - «SFP). With D1 = $13,636, g = -$1363.64, i = 8 percent, and n = 10, D =
$13,636 + (-$1363.64/0.08)[1 - 10(0.06903)] = $8357.

5. Compute the annual cost under sum-of-digits depreciation

Referring to step 2 and taking the difference between the equivalent depreciation charge
in the present case and the depreciation charge under the straight-line method, we deter-
mine the annual cost A = $9960 - ($8357 - $7500)(0.47) = $9557.
Related Calculations: A comparison of the two values of annual cost—$9960
when straight-line depreciation is used and $9557 when sum-of-digits depreciation is
used—confirms the statement made in an earlier calculation procedure. Since tax savings
accrue more quickly under sum-of-digits depreciation than under straight-line deprecia-
tion, the former method is more advantageous to the firm. In general, a firm seeks to write
off an asset rapidly in order to secure tax savings as quickly as possible, thus allowing it
to retain more capital for investment. For this reason depreciation accounting is subject to
stringent regulation by the IRS.

COST COMPARISON WITH ANTICIPATED
DECREASING COSTS

Two alternative machines, A and B, are available for a manufacturing operation. The life
span is 4 years for machine A and 6 years for machine B. The equivalent uniform annual
cost is estimated to be $16,000 for machine A and $15,000 for machine B. However, as a
result of advances in technology, the annual cost is expected to decline at a constant rate
from one life to the next, the rate of decline being 10 percent for machine A and 6 percent
for machine B. Applying an investment rate of 12 percent, determine which machine is
preferable.

Calculation Procedure:

1. Select the analysis period, and compute annual costs
for this period

The cost comparison will be made by the present-worth method. The analysis period is 12
years, since this is the lowest common multiple of 4 and 6. The annual costs are as fol-
lows: Machine A: first life, $16,000; second life, $16,000(0.90) = $14,400; third life,
$14,400(0.90) = $12,960. Machine B: first life, $15,000; second life, $15,000(0.94) =
$14,100.

2. Construct a money-time diagram

The equivalent uniform annual payments are shown in Fig. 6.

3. Compute the present worth of costs for the first analysis
period, and identify the more economical machine

For machine A, PW = $16,000(USPW, n = 4) + $14,400(USPW, n = 4)(SPPW, n = 4) +
$12,960(USPW, n = 4)(SPPW, n = 8). With / = 12 percent, PW = $16,000(3.037) +
$14,400(3.037)(0.6355) + $12,960(3.037)(0.4039) = $92,280. For machine B, PW =
$15,000(USPW, /1 = 6) + $14,100(USPW, n = 6)(SPPW, n = 6), or PW = $15,000(4.111)
+ $14,100(4.111)(0.5066) = $91,030. Machine B should be used for the first 12 years be-
cause it costs less.

4. Compute the present worth of costs for the second
analysis period

The second 12-year period encompasses the fourth, fifth, and sixth lives of machine A
and the third and fourth lives of machine B. The "present" is the beginning of the second
12-year period. The annual cost of machine A during its fourth life is (0.9O)3 times the an-
nual cost during its first life. Therefore, the results of step 3 can be applied. For machine
A, PW = $92,280(0.90)3 - $67,270. For machine B, PW = $91,030(0.94)2 = $80,430.
Thus, machine A should be used after the first 12 years. Realistically, since the transfer
from machine B to machine A can be made at the end of the first 6-year period, the deci-
sion should be reviewed at that time in the light of currently available forecasts.

ECONOMY OF REPLACING AN ASSET WITH
AN IMPROVED MODEL

A machine has been in use for 3 years, and its cost data for the next 8 years are shown in
Table 2, where the years are counted from the present. An improved model of this ma-
chine has just appeared on the market, and according to estimates it has an optimal life of
6 years with an equivalent uniform annual cost of $9400. No additional improvements are
anticipated in the near future. If money is worth 10 percent, when will it be most econom-
ical to retire the existing machine?

Calculation Procedure:

1. Compute an equivalent single end-of-life payment for each
prospective remaining life

Let R = remaining life of machine, years. The annual cost corresponding to every possible
value of R will be found by a method that is a variation of that used in an earlier calcula-
tion procedure. Let CR = operating cost at end of Rth year and FR = equivalent single pay-

ment at end ofRth year. Then F^ = F^1(I + O + CR. By retaining the existing machine, the
firm forfeits an income of $12,000, and this is equivalent to making a payment of that
amount now. Then F0 = $12,000; F1 = $12,000(1.10) + $4700 = $17,900; F2 =
$17,900(1.10) + $5200 - $24,890; F3 = $24,890(1.10) + $5800 - $33,179; etc. The re-
sults are shown in Table 3.

2. Compute the annual cost for every prospective remaining life

Let AR = annual cost for a remaining life of R years, and LR — salvage value at end of Rth
year. Then AR = (FR - LjO(SFP, n = R). Thus, with i = 10 percent, A1 = ($17,900 -
$8000)1 = $9900; A2 = ($24,890 - $5000)(0.47619) = $9471; A3 = ($33,179 -
$4000)(0.30211) - $8815; etc. The results are shown in Table 3.

3. Determine whether the existing machine should be retired now

When an asset is purchased and installed, its resale value drops sharply during the early
years of its life, and thus the firm incurs a rapid loss of capital during those years. The re-
sult is that the annual cost for the remaining life of an existing asset is considerably less
than the annual cost when the asset was first purchased.
Table 3 shows that the optimal remaining life of the existing machine is 5 years and

the corresponding annual cost is $8502. Since this is less than the annual cost of the new
machine ($9400), the existing machine should be retained for at least 5 years.

4. Determine precisely when the existing machine
should be replaced

Since costs increase beyond the f if th year, the existing machine and the improved model
will be compared on a year-by-year basis. Let BR = cost of retaining existing machine 1
year beyond the Rth year. Then BR = LR(l + i) - LR+l + cR+l. Thus, B5 = $3000(1.10) -
$2700 + $8500 = $9100. Since this is less than the annual cost of the new model, the ex-
isting machine should not be retired 5 years hence. Continuing, we find B6 = $2700(1.10)
- $2600 + $9700 = $10,070, which exceeds $9400. Therefore, the existing machine
should be retired 6 years hence.

ECONOMY OF REPLACEMENT UNDER
CONTINUING IMPROVEMENTS

A newly acquired machine costs $40,000, and it has the salvage values and annual operat-
ing costs shown in Table 4. It is anticipated that a new model will become available at the
end of each year. All future models will have first costs and salvage values identical with
those of the present model, but the annual operating cost for a given model will be $600
lower than the corresponding annual operating cost of the preceding model. For example,
the model that becomes available 1 year hence will have an operating cost of $11,400 for
the first year, $12,400 for the second year, etc. Applying an interest rate of 10 percent, de-
termine how long this machine should be held.

Calculation Procedure:

1. Establish the excess operating costs in relation to a 1-year life

When the machine is retired, it will be replaced with the model that becomes available at
that date. First assume that the machine is retired at the end of each year. The operating
costs for the next 8 years are shown in Table 5. Now assume that the machine is held for 8
years. Subtracting the values just found from the values in Table 4 gives the excess oper-
ating costs for an 8-year life; these are shown in Table 5. This table also gives the excess
operating costs for every prospective life of the machine. For example, if the machine is

held 3 years, the excess operating cost is $1600 for the second year and $3800 for the
third year, and these values apply to each subsequent life. Since only differences in cost
are significant, the prospective lives of the machine will be compared by applying the ex-
cess rather than the actual operating costs.

2. Compute an equivalent single end-of-life payment for every
prospective life

Annual costs will be computed by using the same method as in the previous calculation
procedure, but applying excess operating costs. Thus, with / = 10 percent, F1 =
$40,000(1.10) = $44,000; F2 = $44,000(1.10) + $1600 = $50,000; F3 - $50,000(1.10) +
$3800 = $58,800; etc. The results are shown in Table 6.

3. Compute the annual cost for every prospective life

Proceeding as in the previous calculation procedure gives A1 = ($44,000 - $25,000)1 =
$19,000; A2 = ($50,000 - $20,000)(0.47619) = $14,286; A3 = ($58,800 - $17,000)
(0.30211) = $12,628; etc. The results are shown in Table 6.

4. Identify the most economical life of the machine

Table 6 reveals that a 4-year life has the minimum annual cost.
Related Calculations: Each excess annual operating cost shown in Table 5 con-
sists of two parts: a deterioration cost, which is the increase in operating cost due to aging

of the machine, and an obsolescence cost, which results from the development of an im-
proved model. For example, at the end of the fourth year the deterioration cost is $16,500
- $12,000 = $4500, and the obsolescence cost is $600 x 3 = $1800. If the quality of the
product declines as the machine ages, the resulting loss of income can be added to the de-
terioration cost.

ECONOMY OF REPLACEMENT
ON AFTER-TAX BASIS

A machine was purchased 3 years ago at a cost of $45,000. It had a life expectancy of 7
years and anticipated salvage value of $3000. It has been depreciated by the sum-of-digits
method. The net resale value of the machine is $13,000 at present and is expected to be
$9000 a year hence. The operating cost during the coming year will be $2600. A newly
developed machine can be substituted for the existing one. According to estimates, this
machine will have an optimal life of 5 years with an annual cost of $4800 on an after-tax
basis. The tax rate is 45 percent for ordinary income and 30 percent for long-term capital
gains. The desired investment rate on an after-tax basis is 8 percent. Determine whether
the existing machine should be replaced at present.

Calculation Procedure:

1. Compute the depreciation charges for the first 4 years

Refer to an earlier calculation procedure for sum-of-digits depreciation. The charges are
Z)1 = $10,500; D2 = $9000; D3 = $7500; D4 = $6000.

2. Compute the book value at the end of the third and fourth years

Let BR = book value at end ofRth year. Then B3 = $45,000 - ($10,500 + $9,000 + $7,500)
- $18,000 and B4 = $18,000 - $6000 - $12,000.

3. Compute the cost of retaining the machine through the
fourth year

Income that accrues from normal business operations is called ordinary income; other
forms of income are called capital gains. The difference between the net income that ac-
crues from selling an asset and its book value at the date of sale is a capital gain (or loss).
If the asset was held for a certain minimum amount of time, this capital gain (or loss) is
subject to a tax rate different from that for ordinary income.
Let R = age of asset, years. The after-tax cost of retaining the asset through the (R +
l)st year, as evaluated at the end of that year, is [LR

4. Determine whether the existing machine should
be retired now

Since the cost of retaining the machine for 1 additional year ($4490) is less than the annu-
al cost of the new machine ($4800), the existing machine should not be retired at present.

Effects of Inflation

Notational System

Here C0 and C1 are the costs of a commodity now and 1 year hence, respectively, and/=
annual rate of inflation during the coming year with respect to this commodity. Then/=
(C1 - C0, or C1 = C0(I +/). Also, Cn = cost of the commodity n years hence. If the annual
rate of inflation remains constant at/ then Cn = C0(I +/)" = C0(SPCA, / =/). In the sub-
sequent material, it is understood that the given inflation rate applies to the asset under
consideration.

DETERMINATION OF REPLACEMENT COST
WITH CONSTANT INFLATION RATE

A machine has just been purchased for $60,000. It is anticipated that the machine will be
held 5 years, that it will have a salvage value of $4000 as based on current prices, and that
the annual rate of inflation during the next 5 years will be 7 percent. The machine will be
replaced with a duplicate, and the firm will accumulate the necessary capital by making
equal end-of-year deposits in a reserve fund that earns 6 percent per annum. Determine
the amount of the annual deposit.

Calculation Procedure:

1. Compute the required replacement capital

Both the cost of a new machine and the salvage value of the existing machine increase at
the given rate. Thus, the amount of money the firm must accumulate to buy a new ma-
chine is ($60,000 - $4000)(1.07)5 = $56,000(1.403) = $78,568.

2. Compute the annual deposit

Use this relation: Annual deposit R = 5(SFP). With i = 6 percent and n = 5, R =
$78,568(0.17740) = $13,938.

DETERMINATION OF REPLACEMENT COST
WITH VARIABLE INFLATION RATE

In the preceding calculation procedure, determine the amount of the annual deposit if the
annual rate of inflation is expected to be 7 percent for the next 3 years and 9 percent there-
after.

Calculation Procedure:

1. Compute the required replacement capital

Replacement capital = $56,000(1.07)3(1.09)2 = $56,000(1.225)(1.188) = $81,497.

2. Compute the annual deposit

From the preceding calculation procedure, annual deposit = $81,497(0.17740) = $14,458.

PRESENT WORTH OF COSTS IN
INFLATIONARY PERIOD

An asset with a first cost of $70,000 is expected to last 6 years and to have the following
additional cost data as based on present costs: salvage value, $5000; annual maintenance,
$8400; major repairs at the end of the fourth year, $9000. The asset will be replaced with
a duplicate when it is retired. Using an interest rate of 12 percent and an inflation rate of 8
percent per year, find the present worth of costs of this asset for the first two lives (i.e., for
12 years).

Calculation Procedure:

1. Compute the present worth of the capital expenditures
for the first life

The "present" refers to the beginning of the first life. The payment for repairs will be
$9000(1.08)4, and the present worth of this payment is $9000(1.08)4(SPPW, n = 4, i = 12
percent) = $9000(1.08)4/(1.12)4 = $7780. Similarly, the present worth of the salvage val-
ue is $5000(1.08)6/(1.12)6 = $4020. Thus, the present worth of capital expenditures for
the first life is $70,000 + $7780 - $4020 = $73,760.

2. Compute the present worth of maintenance for the first life

The annual payments for maintenance constitute a uniform-rate series in which the first
payment R1 = $8400(1.08) = $9072 and the ratio of one payment to the preceding pay-
ment is r = 1.08. By Eq. 9, the present-worth factor of the series is URSPW =
[(1.08/1.12)6 - 1]/(1.08 - 1.12) = 4.901. Then present worth of series = ,K1(URSPW) =
$9072(4.901) = $44,460.

3. Compute the present worth of costs for the first life

Summing the results, we see that present worth = $73,760 + $44,460 = $118,220.

4. Compute the present worth of costs for the second life

Since each payment in the second life is (1.08)6 times the corresponding payment in the
first life, the value of all payments in the second life, evaluated at the beginning of that
life, is (1.08)6 times that for the first life, or $118,220(1.08)6. The present worth of this
amount is $118,220(1.08)6/( 1.12)6 = $95,040.

5. Compute the present worth of costs for the first two lives

Summing the results yields PW = $118,220 + $95,040 = $213,260.
Related Calculations: Let h = [(I +/)/(! + OF, where N= life of asset, years.
In the standard case, where all annual payments as based on present costs are equal and
no extraordinary intermediate payments occur, the present worth of costs for the first
life is P - Lh + c(

ent costs. Where extraordinary payments occur, simply add the present worth of these
payments, as was done in the present case with respect to repairs at the end of the fourth
year. In the special case where/= f, the present worth of costs for the first life is P - L
+ Nc.

Determine which machine is more economical, using an interest rate of 10 percent and
annual inflation rate of 7 percent.

Calculation Procedure:

1. Establish the method of cost comparison

The present-worth method is suitable here. Select an analysis period of 12 years, which
encompasses three lives of machine A and two lives of machine B.

2. Compute the present worth of costs of machine A
for the first life

Refer to the equation given at the conclusion of the preceding calculation procedure. Set h
= (1.07/1.1O)4 = 0.89529. By reversing the sequence in the last two terms of the equation,
present worth = $45,000 - $3000(0.89529) + $8000(1.07)0 - 0.89529)7(0.10 - 0.07) =
$72,190.

3. Compute the present worth of costs of machine A
for the first three lives

Refer to step 4 of the preceding calculation procedure. Thus, PW = $72,190[1 +
(1.07/1.1O)4 + (1.07/1.1O)8] = $72,190(2.69684) = $194,680.

4. Compute the present worth of costs of machine B
for the first Ufe

Set h = (1.07/1.1O)6 = 0.84712. The present worth of costs for the first life = $80,000 -
$2000(0.84712) + $60000.07)0 ~ 0.84712)7(0.10 - 0.07) = $111,020.

5. Compute the present worth of costs of machine B
for the first two lives

PW = $111,020(1 + 0.84712) = $205,070.

6. Determine which machine is preferable

Machine A has the lower cost and so is preferable.

ENDOWMENT WITH ALLOWANCE
FOR INFLATION

An endowment fund is to provide perpetual annual payments to a research institute. The
first payment, to be made 1 year hence, will be $10,000. Each subsequent payment will be
2 percent more than the preceding payment, to allow for inflation. If the interest rate of
the fund is 7 percent per annum, what amount must be deposited in the fund now? Verify
the result.

Calculation Procedure:

1. Compute the amount to be deposited

The payments form a uniform-rate series, and the amount to be deposited = P = present
worth of series. Refer to Eq. 9 for the present-worth factor. When r < 1 + i and n is infi-
nite, URSPW = 1/(1 + i - r). With i = 7 percent and r = 1.02, URSPW = 1/(1.07 - 1.02) =
20. Then P = ^1URSPW) = $10,000(20) - $200,000.

2. Prove that this deposit will provide an endless
stream of payments

The proof consists in finding the rate at which the principal in the fund is growing. At the
end of the first year, principal = $200,000(1.07) - $10,000 •= $204,000. The rate of in-
crease in principal = ($204,000 - $200,000)/$200,000 = 2 percent per year. Similarly, at
the end of the second year, principal = $204,000(1.07) - $10,000(1.02) = $208,080. The
rate of increase in principal = ($208,080 - $204,000)/$204,000 = 2 percent per year.
Thus, the end-of-year principal expands at the same rate as the payments, and so the pay-
ments can continue indefinitely.
Related Calculations: If the interest period of the fund differs from the payment
period, it is necessary to use the interest rate corresponding to the payment period. For ex-
ample, assume that the interest rate is 7 percent per annum compounded quarterly. The cor-
responding annual (or effective) rate is i = (1.0175)4 - 1 = 7.186 percent, and URSPW =
17(1.07186 - 1.02) = 19.283. The amount to be deposited = $192,830. Note that if r > 1 +1,
URSPW becomes infinite as n becomes infinite. Thus, if the interest rate of the fund is 7
percent per annum, it is impossible to allow the payments to increase by 7 percent or more.

ENDOWMENT WITH ALLOWANCE
FOR INFLATION

An endowment fund is to provide perpetual annual payments to a research institute. The
first payment, to be made 1 year hence, will be $10,000. Each subsequent payment will be
2 percent more than the preceding payment, to allow for inflation. If the interest rate of
the fund is 7 percent per annum, what amount must be deposited in the fund now? Verify
the result.

Calculation Procedure:

1. Compute the amount to be deposited

The payments form a uniform-rate series, and the amount to be deposited = P = present
worth of series. Refer to Eq. 9 for the present-worth factor. When r < 1 + i and n is infi-
nite, URSPW = 1/(1 + i - r). With i = 7 percent and r = 1.02, URSPW = 1/(1.07 - 1.02) =
20. Then P = ^1URSPW) = $10,000(20) - $200,000.

2. Prove that this deposit will provide an endless
stream of payments

The proof consists in finding the rate at which the principal in the fund is growing. At the
end of the first year, principal = $200,000(1.07) - $10,000 •= $204,000. The rate of in-
crease in principal = ($204,000 - $200,000)/$200,000 = 2 percent per year. Similarly, at
the end of the second year, principal = $204,000(1.07) - $10,000(1.02) = $208,080. The
rate of increase in principal = ($208,080 - $204,000)/$204,000 = 2 percent per year.
Thus, the end-of-year principal expands at the same rate as the payments, and so the pay-
ments can continue indefinitely.
Related Calculations: If the interest period of the fund differs from the payment
period, it is necessary to use the interest rate corresponding to the payment period. For ex-
ample, assume that the interest rate is 7 percent per annum compounded quarterly. The cor-
responding annual (or effective) rate is i = (1.0175)4 - 1 = 7.186 percent, and URSPW =
17(1.07186 - 1.02) = 19.283. The amount to be deposited = $192,830. Note that if r > 1 +1,
URSPW becomes infinite as n becomes infinite. Thus, if the interest rate of the fund is 7
percent per annum, it is impossible to allow the payments to increase by 7 percent or more.

Evaluation of Investments

PREMIUM-WORTH METHOD OF
INVESTMENT EVALUATION

A firm contemplates investing in a depleting asset and has a choice between two enter-
prises. Project A requires the investment of $57,500; project B requires the investment of
$63,000. The forecast end-of-year dividends are as follows:

Year 

Project A, $ 

Project B, $

1 
2 
3 
4 
5 

10,000 
15,000 
25,000 
20,000 
10,000

15,000
25,000
30,000
20,000

After weighing the risks involved, the firm decides that the minimum acceptable rate of
return on project A is 10 percent; on project B, 12 percent. Evaluate these investments by
the premium-worth method. If both investments are satisfactory, determine which is more
satisfactory.

Calculation Procedure:

1. Compute the present worth of the dividends
from both investments

The present generally refers to the date on which the investment is made. Where the pres-
ent worth is greater than the sum invested, the excess is termed the premium worth. Such
a result signifies that the true investment rate exceeds the minimum acceptable rate.
For any year, PW = (dividend, $)(PW factor for 10 percent and the number of years in-
volved). Thus, for project A:

Year 

1 
2 
3 
4 
5 

Total 

PW

$10,000(0.9091) =$9,091
15,000(0.8264) = 12,396
25,000(0.7513) = 18,783
20,000(0.6830) = 13,660
10,000(0.6209)= 6,209

$60,139

Then the premium worth - $60,139 - 57,500 = $2639.
By using a similar procedure, the present worth of project B at 12 percent is as fol-
lows:

Year 

1 
2 
3 
4 
Total 

PW

$15,000(0.8929) =$13,394
25,000(0.7972)= 19,930
30,000(0.7118)= 21,354
20,000(0.6355)= 12,710
$67,388

Then the premium worth = $67,388 - $63,000 = $4388.

2. Determine the relative values of the investments

Since both investments satisfy the minimum requirements, determine their relative values
by computing the premium-worth percentage (i.e., the ratio of the premium worth to the
capital invested). Thus, for project A the premium-worth percentage is $2639(100)/
$57,500 4.6 percent. For project B the premium-worth percentage is $4388(100)/$63,000
= 7.0 percent. Thus, project B is the more attractive because it has a higher premium-
worth percentage.

VALUATION OF CORPORATE BONDS

A $10,000,4 percent corporation bond paying semiannual dividends is redeemable at 102
at the end of 15 years. What is the maximum price an investor should pay for this bond if
he desires a return of 6 percent compounded semiannually?

Calculation Procedure:

1. Determine the semiannual dividend and redemption payment

The dividend = (principal, $)i/2 = $10,000(0.04/2) = $200. Also, the redemption payment
= (redemption price/100)(principal) = (102/100)($ 10,000) = $10,200.

2. Compute the purchase price

Using an interest rate of 6/2 = 3 percent per semiannual period, compute the present
worth of the dividends and the redemption payment. Equate the present worth to the pur-
chase price of the bond. Or, purchase price = (dividend, $)(USPW) + (redemption pay-
ment, $)(SPPW), for i = 3 percent, n = 30. Hence, purchase price = ($200)(19.60) +
($10,200)(0.4120) = $8122.

RATE OF RETURN ON BOND INVESTMENT

A $10,000, 6 percent, 20-year bond paid dividends semiannually and was redeemed at
par. An investor bought the bond for $11,500 at its date of issue and held it to maturity.
What interest rate did the holder earn?

Calculation Procedure:

1. Record the payment and receipts associated
with the investment

The payment was $11,500 at the date of issue. The receipt for each semiannual interest
period was (6 percent/2)($ 10,000) = $300 for 40 periods. Also, $10,000 was received at
the end of the 40 periods. The correct interest rate is that which will make the payment
equal the receipts.

2. Select a trial interest rate and compute the results

Selecting an interest rate of 2.5 percent as a trial, compute the value of the receipts at the
date of issue, using the USPW factor for the dividends and the SPPW factor for the prin-
cipal repayment. Or, ($300)(25.103) + $10,000(0.3724) = $11,255. Since the purchase
price exceeded this value, the true interest rate was less than 2.5 percent.

3. Select another trial interest rate

Repeat the previous calculation, using a 2 percent rate. Or, $300(27.355) + $10,000
(0.4529) = $12,736.

4. Interpolate linearly between the trial values

Interest rate, % 

Purchase price, $

2.5 
1 
2 

11,255

12,736

This interpolation gives i = 2.42 percent per semiannual period, or 4.84 percent per an-
num compounded semiannually.

INVESTMENT-RATE CALCULATION AS
ALTERNATIVE TO ANNUAL-COST
CALCULATION

In the Comparison of Equipment Cost and Income Generated procedure in this section, it
was concluded that the proposed investment in labor-saving equipment could not be justi-
fied because it failed to yield the minimum acceptable rate of 8 percent. Determine the ac-
tual rate of return for this investment.

Calculation Procedure:

1. Compute the net annual dividend

Labor saving 
Rental income 
Total 
Less maintenance 
Net dividend 

$4000
1000
$5000
600
$4400

2. Select a trial interest rate

Using an interest rate of 5 percent, determine the present worth of the dividends and the
equipment salvage value. Thus, (net dividend, S)(USPW) + (salvage value, S)(SPPW), for
/ = 5 percent, n = 7 years. Or, $4400(5.786) + $5000(0.7107) = $29,012. Since the invest-
ment was $30,000, the actual interest rate is smaller.

3. Test another trial interest rate

Using a 4 percent interest rate and repeating the calculation in step 2, we get $4400
(6.002) + $5000(0.7599) = $30,208.

4. Interpolate linearly to obtain the actual interest rate

Linear interpolation yields a rate of i = 4.2 percent. This verifies that the earlier results
were valid.

ALLOCATION OF INVESTMENT CAPITAL

In devising a program for investment of $8000 in surplus funds, a firm has a choice be-
tween two plans. Each plan pays an annual dividend and repayment of the invested capi-
tal when the venture terminates. Under plan A the dividend varies with the sum invested
in the manner shown below. Under plan B the dividend rate is 10 percent, irrespective of
the sum invested. In what manner should this firm divide its investment capital to secure
the maximum return?

Calculation Procedure:

1. L/st the annual dividends obtainable

The table below shows the dividend that can be expected under plan A.

2. Construct a dividend-investment diagram

Figure 7 shows the dividend-investment diagram for this situation. Points A to H repre-
sent the sets of values under plan A. The slope of a line connecting any two points repre-
sents the rate of return on the incremental investment. For example, the slope of line EG =
$270/$2000 = 0.135, or 13.5 percent represents the rate obtained on the $2000 investment
added in going from E to G, Fig. 7.

3. Determine the investments to make

Draw line OJ, Fig. 7, having a slope of 10 percent, the dividend rate under plan B. Next,

determine which of the points, A to H, is most distant from line OJ. Do this by scaling the
vertical offsets or by drawing lines through these points parallel to OJ.
Point G, which has a vertical offset of $520, is the most distant one. Therefore, $7000
is the appropriate sum to invest in plan A because of the following: (a) When the invest-
ment is extended from some lower level, such as $5000, to the stipulated level, the rate of
return on this incremental investment, which is represented by the slope of line EG, ex-
ceeds 10 percent, (b) If the investment is carried beyond G, the rate of return on this in-
cremental investment, represented by the slope of line GH, is less than 10 percent. Hence,
this firm should allocate $7000 to plan A and $1000 to plan B.
Related Calculations: As an alternative, construct the following tabulation to
determine the total annual dividend corresponding to every possible division of the capi-
tal. Study of this table shows that the maximum dividend of $1320 accrues when $7000 is
allocated to plan A and $1000 to plan B.

ALLOCATION OF CAPITAL TO TWO
INVESTMENTS WITH VARIABLE RATES
OFRETURN

Suppose that the dividend under plan B in the previous procedure is 15 percent of the first
$3000 invested and 10 percent of the excess. Determine the optimal division of the $8000
investment between the two plans.

Calculation Procedure:

1. Construct a dividend-investment diagram

Use Fig. 7 and draw line OK having a slope of 10 percent and line KL having a slope of
15 percent, where K has an abscissa of $5000. The ordinate of each point on the line OKL
represents the prospective plan B dividend that is forfeited by allocating part of the in-
vestment capital to plan A. The optimal division of the investment capital is that for
which the excess of plan A dividends over forfeited plan B dividends is the maximum.

2. Determine the investment allocation

Find which of the points from A to His most distant from the line OKL. This is point D,

which has a vertical offset of $500. Therefore, the firm should allocate $4000 to plan A
and $4000 to plan B.
Related Calculations: Alternatively, calculate the total dividend corresponding
to every possible division of the available capital. For example, if $1000 is allocated to
plan A and $7000 to plan B: Dividend under plan A = $300; dividend under plan B =
$3000(0.15) + $4000(0.10) = $850; total dividend = $1150. Using this technique, we find
the maximum total dividend to be $1450; this occurs when the capital is divided equally
between two plans. Thus, the previous findings are verified.
This procedure and the previous one show two methods of establishing the optimal di-
vision of available capital, i.e., computing the rate of return on an incremental investment
and computing the total dividend. The latter represents a more straightforward approach,
particularly where both alternative investments yield a variable rate of return.

ALLOCATION OF CAPITAL TO THREE
INVESTMENTS BY DYNAMIC
PROGRAMMING

A syndicate has $600,000 available for investment; and three investment plans, A, B, and
C, are under consideration. Under each plan, the amount that can be invested is a multiple
of $100,000 and the investors receive annual dividends and recover their capital when the
venture terminates at the expiration of 5 years. The annual dividends corresponding to the
various levels of investment are shown in Table 7. The investments can be combined in
any manner whatever. Devise the most profitable composite investment.

Calculation Procedure:

1. Identify the most profitable combination of plans A and B
and determine the corresponding annual dividend if $600,000
is placed in this combination

The problem of identifying the most profitable combination of all three plans can be
solved by dynamic programming. By this technique, the most profitable combination will
be formed in stages, starting with combinations of A and B, identifying the most prof-
itable ones, and then expanding these to include C.

0 + 94= 94

The possible combinations of plans A and B corresponding to a total investment of
$600,000 are shown in Table 8, and their corresponding annual dividends are computed
by applying the values given in Table 7. The most profitable combination for the stipulat-
ed total investment is one in which $200,000 is placed in plan A and $400,000 is placed in
plan B. The corresponding annual dividend is $135,000.

2. Identify the most profitable combination of plans A and B
and determine the corresponding annual dividend if any amount
is placed in this combination

The amount that can be placed in this combination is a multiple of $100,000 with an up-
per limit of $600,000. Repeat the procedure in step 1 to obtain the results shown in Table
9. The nations listed in this table are candidates for the most profitable combination of all
three plans, and the other combinations of A and B are now discarded.

3. Compute the maximum dividend that can be obtained
from a combination of all three plans

The calculations are shown in Table 10. As an illustration, assume that $400,000 will be
placed in the A-B combination, leaving $600,000 - $400,000 = $200,000 for plan C.
From Table 9, the annual dividend from the A-B combination is $91,000; from Table 7,

the dividend from plan C is $31,000. Thus, the total dividend is $91,000 + $31,000 =
$122,000. Table 10 shows that the maximum possible dividend is $135,000.

4. Identify the most profitable combination of all three plans

From Table 10, the most profitable combination results from placing $600,000 in the A-B
combination and nothing in plan C. From Table 9, the A-B combination consists in plac-
ing $200,000 in A and $400,000 in B. Thus, the most profitable way of dividing the capi-
tal is $200,000 in plan A, $400,000 in plan B, and nothing in plan C.
Related Calculations: This problem can be solved directly by forming all possi-
ble combinations of plans A, B, and C and computing their annual dividends; the number
of combinations is 28. However, where the number of combinations is very large, the di-
rect method becomes unwieldy. Dynamic programming provides a systematic way of
solving the problem, and it reduces the number of calculations. It will be applied again in
a later calculation procedure.

ECONOMIC LEVEL OF INVESTMENT

A firm planned to purchase and improve property in the expectation that land values in
the area would appreciate in the near future. The question arose as to how large an invest-
ment should be made. The following data were compiled for five alternative plans, each
representing a different level of investment.

If 12 percent is considered the minimum acceptable rate of return, determine the most at-
tractive plan.

Calculation Procedure:

1. Establish a basis of comparison for the investments

To establish a basis of comparison, assume that each investment pays an annual dividend
and that the invested capital remains intact until the venture terminates. (Although these
assumptions are not realistic, they are entirely valid for comparative purposes.)

2. Calculate the annual dividend under each plan

Thus, for plan A, the annual dividend = $200,000(0.141) = $28,200. Compute the divi-
dends for the other plans in the same manner.

3. Construct a dividend-investment diagram

Use the same procedure as for Fig. 7. Plot the points representing the sets of values asso-
ciated with the five plans.
Draw a line through the origin of the dividend-investment diagram with a slope of 12
percent. Determine which point is most distant from this line. This point corresponds to
the most profitable rate of return. Study of the plot shows that plan B should be adopted.
Related Calculations: To compare these five plans algebraically, assume that
the firm has a total available capital of $460,000 (the investment required under plan E)
and that the amount remaining after investment in one of the five plans will be allocated
to another investment yielding an annual dividend of 12 percent.
Next, calculate the total annual dividend corresponding to each plan.

460,000(0.123) 
=56,580

Since plan B yields the highest total dividend, it is the best choice.

RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN BEFORE-TAX
AND AFTER-TAX INVESTMENT RATES

A corporation is investigating a proposed investment under which it will receive annual
dividends and recover its capital when the venture terminates in 12 years. Since the ven-
ture is highly speculative, the firm wishes to earn a minimum of 15 percent on its capital
as calculated after the payment of taxes. If income from the investment will be taxed at 56
percent, what must be the minimum rate of return as calculated before the payment of tax-
es?

Calculation Procedure:

Compute the minimum acceptable before-tax investment rate

Use the relation ib =

APPARENT RATES OF RETURN
ONA CONTINUING INVESTMENT

A firm leasing construction equipment purchased an asset for $24,000, charging depreci-
ation on a straight-line basis. The life used was 4 years; salvage value, zero. The asset was
used for 6 years and scrapped for $800. Net revenues obtained from this asset are listed in
Table 11. The firm's normal income was taxed at 50 percent, but the proceeds from the
salvage sale were taxed at 25 percent. What were the apparent rates of return on this asset
investment, after taxes, computed during the life of the asset?

Calculation Procedure:

1. Compute the annual depreciation charge

Using the straight-line method and a 4-year life, we get the annual depreciation =
$24,000/4 = $6000, assuming zero salvage. Record the depreciation charge in the third
column of Table 11.

2. Compute the net profit before taxes

Deduct from the annual net revenue the annual depreciation charge, Table 11, and enter
the result in column 4. Thus, for the first year with a revenue of $10,000, the net income
before taxes = $10,000 - $6000 = $4000.

3. Compute the after-tax profit

With a tax of 50 percent of the profit before taxes, multiply the value in Table 11, column
4. by 0.50 to determine the after-tax profit. Thus, for year 1, the after-tax profit =
$4000(0.50) = $2000.

4. Record the asset book value at the beginning of the year

In this type of calculation, the book value = the unrecovered capital investment for that
year. Or, for year 1, the book value = $24,000. For year 2, the book value = $24,000 -
$6000 - $18,000. In this relation, $6000 is the depreciation during year 1.

5. Compute the apparent rate of return

Divide the after-tax profit for any year by the book value of the asset at the beginning of
the year to determine the apparent rate of return. Or, for year 2, apparent rate of return =
$1800/$ 18,000 = 0.10, or 10.0 percent.

TRUE RATE OF RETURN ON
A COMPLETED INVESTMENT

Refer to the previous calculation procedure. What was the actual after-tax rate of return
yielded by this investment, computed at the conclusion of the venture?

Calculation Procedure:

1. Determine the after-tax income

In this situation, only the actual disbursements and receipts, as well as their timing, are
pertinent. The depreciation charges, which arise from bookkeeping entries, are irrelevant.
To determine the after-tax income, deduct the tax payment from the net revenue listed
in Table 11 to obtain the after-tax income. List this income in Table 12.

2. Determine the present worth of the annual receipts

Compute the present worth of each year's after-tax income for years 1 through 6, and take
the sum. To perform this computation, assume an interest rate that is believed to approxi-
mate the actual rate of return on the $24,000 investment.
At 12 percent, present worth of the after-tax income = $24,444. At 15 percent, present
worth of the after-tax income = $22,874. By linear interpolation for a present worth of
$24,000, i = rate of return = 12.8 percent.

AVERAGE RATE OF RETURN
ON COMPOSITE INVESTMENT

Suppose that the income in the previous calculation procedure were reinvested at 8 per-
cent after taxes, until the end of the fourth year. Thereafter, the income received was rein-
vested at 10 percent. What was the average rate of return on the $24,000 capital during
the 6-year period?

Calculation Procedure:

1. Compute the value of the original capital at the end
of the sixth year

Thus, by using the SPCA factor for the after-tax income listed for each year in Table 12

for i — 8 or 10 percent, the value of the original capital at the end of the sixth year =
$8000(1.469) + $7800(1.360) + $7000(1.260) + $6200(1.166) + $2200(1.100) + $1800 =
$42,629.

2. Compute the average investment rate

Let i' = average investment rate. Equate the original investment to $42,629 at a date 6
years in the future, and solve for i''. Thus, $24,000(SPCA for i") = $42,629; i" = 10.1 per-
cent.

RATE OF RETURN ON A
SPECULATIVE INVESTMENT

A firm purchased a parcel of land for $25,000 and spent $600 during the first year to im-
prove the property. (This investment for improvements should be considered a lump-sum
end-of-year payment.) The expenses for real estate tax, insurance, and maintenance to-
taled $ 1200 per year. At the end of 5 years, the firm sold the property at a price that yield-
ed $48,700 after payment of legal fees and commissions. In computing the federal income
tax, the firm deducted the ordinary expenses of holding this property from the income de-
rived from other sources. This income was subject to a 53 percent tax rate. The profit on
the sale of the land was taxed at the 25 percent capital-gains rate. What was the rate of re-
turn on the investment?

Calculation Procedure:

1. Determine the effective annual payment

The expenses related to possession of the land served to reduce the income tax payments.
Therefore, the effective cost of holding the property (or any similar asset) was less than
the actual expenses. To obtain the effective annual payment, deduct the annual income
tax saving from the annual payment related to the asset. Thus, effective annual payment =
$1200(1.00-0.53)-$564.

2. Compute the net proceeds from the sale of the asset

Deduct the capital-gains tax from the selling price of the asset to obtain the net proceeds.
This is often called the effective selling price. Thus, capital gains = $48,700 - ($25,000 +
$600) = $23,100. The capital-gains tax = $23,100(0.25) = $5775. Hence, net proceeds =
$48,700-$5775 = $42,925.

3. Set up an equation for the rate of return

Selecting the date at which the asset was sold as the reference date, express the value of
every sum of money, and equate the total effective payments to the income. Thus,
$25,000(SPCA for « = 5 years, i = ?) + $600(SPCA for n = 4 years, i = ?) + $564(USCA
for /i = 5 years, i = ?) = $42,925.

4. Solve the rate-of-return equation, using trial values

As a trial, set / = 10 percent, and evaluate the left-hand side of the relation in step 3. Thus,
$25,000(1.611) + $600(1.464) + $564(6.105) = $44,597.
Since the actual income, $42,925, was less than $44,597, the assumed rate of return is
too high. Try 8 percent. Then $25,000(1.469) + $600(1.360) + $564(5.867) = $40,850.
This is less than the actual income. Interpolating linearly between the two trial values
yields / = 9.1 percent.

Related Calculations: As a general guide for selecting trial rate-of-return val-
ues, choose a higher value and a lower value around the estimated true rate of return.
Check the result by computing the dollar return. Interpolate linearly when higher and low-
er dollar returns are obtained.

INVESTMENTATAN INTERMEDIATE DATE
(AMBIGUOUS CASE)

A firm purchased an oil-producing property under terms which did not require an imme-
diate payment to the seller but which did require payment of royalties on income from
sale of the oil.
By the end of the third year, the primary reserves were nearly exhausted, and the firm
spent $2,830,000 on a water-injection program to extend the oil yield. Operations were
continued until the end of the sixth year. The income from the venture is listed in Table
13. Compute the rate of return on this investment. Is more than one solution obtained?
How may the ambiguity inherent in this type of investment be resolved?

Calculation Procedure:

1. Set up an equation for the rate of return

Selecting the end of the third year as the reference date, express the value of every sum of
money. Consider receipts to be positive and expenditures to be negative. Then
$600,000(SPCA for n = 2, i = ?) + $300,000(SPCA for n = 1, i = ?) + $100,000 +
$1,220,000(SPPW for TI = 1, i = ?) + $500,000(SPPW for /i = 2, i = ?) + $200,000(SPPW
for n = 3, j = ?) - $2,830,000 = O.

2. Solve the rate-of-return equation, using trial values

Assign a series of trial values for / in the equation in step 1. Record the results in Table
14. Then, by linear interpolation, i = 9.8 percent, or / = 30.1 percent.

3. Evaluate the rates of return obtained

The polynomial in step 1 resembles a quadratic polynomial since it contains either two
real roots or none. That there are two values of i which satisfy this equation is explained
as follows.

First, consider that i = 9.8 percent, causing the polynomial to assume the value of zero.
Then replace 9.8 percent with the higher rate of 30.1 percent. Second, when this substitu-
tion is made, the value of the income received prior to the end of the third year is in-
creased by a certain amount. The value of the income received after that date is decreased
by the same amount. Hence, the value of the polynomial remains zero.

4. Make a realistic appraisal of the investment

A realistic appraisal of an investment of this type requires consideration of the reinvest-
ment rate earned by either the entire income or that part of the income received prior to
the expenditure. In the present instance, assume that the income received up to the end of
the third year was reinvested at 8 percent. Its value at the date of the expenditure for water
injection is, by the equation from step 1, $600,000(1.166) + $300,000(1.080) + $100,000
-$1,123,600.
Then the effective investment = $2,830,000 - $1,123,600 = $1,706,400. To determine
the rate of return, set the effective investment $1,706,400 = $1,220,000(SPPW for n = 1)
+ $500,000(SPPW for /i = 2) + $200,000(SPPW for n = 3) and solve for i. The result of
this solution is / = 8.5 percent.
Related Calculations: This procedure illustrates the fact that in financial analy-
ses it is not possible to place exclusive reliance on mathematical results. However rigor-
ous the mathematical solution may appear to be, the results must be interpreted in a prac-
tical manner. Note that this procedure may be used for any type of asset.

PAYBACK PERIOD OF AN INVESTMENT

A firm has a choice of two alternative investment plans, A and B. Each plan requires an
immediate expenditure of $2,000,000, lasts 10 years, and yields an income at the end of
each year. Under plan A, the annual income is expected to be $450,000 for the first 5
years and $33,000 for the remaining 5 years. Under plan B, the annual income is expected
to be $150,000 for the first 3 years, $250,000 for the next 3 years, and $650,000 for the
last 4 years. If the decision is to be based on a short payback period, which investment
plan should the firm adopt?

Calculation Procedure:

1. Compute the payback period under plan A

For various reasons, a firm often prefers an investment that allows it to recover its capital
quickly. The speed with which capital is recovered is measured by the payback period,
defined thus: Assume that all income accruing from the investment initially represents re-
covered capital, and all income accruing after capital has been fully recovered represents
interest. The time required for completion of capital recovery is called the payback peri-
od.

Under plan A, the first four payments total $1,800,000, and the first five payments to-
tal $2,250,000. Thus, the fifth payment completes capital recovery, and the payback peri-
od is 5 years.

2. Compute the payback period under plan B

The first seven payments total $1,850,000, and the first eight payments total $2,500,000.
Thus, the payback period is 8 years.

3. Select the investment plan

The firm should adopt plan A because it has the lower payback period.
Related Calculations: The investment rate is 6.0 percent for plan A and 10.0
percent for plan B. However, since the income under plan B is largely deferred, use of the
payback period as a criterion in investment appraisal places plan B at a disadvantage.

PAYBACKPERIOD TO YIELD
A GIVEN INVESTMENT RATE

An asset has a first cost of $40,000 and maximum life of 10 years. Its resale value will be
$3500 at the end of the first year, and then it will diminish by $500 per year, becoming
zero at the end of the eighth year. The end-of-year income that accrues from use of this
asset will be $12,000 for the first 2 years, $8000 for the next 3 years, $6000 for the next 3
years, and $2000 for the last 2 years. Determine how long this asset must be held to se-
cure a 10 percent return on the investment.

Calculation Procedure:

1. Establish the criterion for finding the life of the asset

As the preceding calculation procedure showed, a firm that considers solely how long it
takes an investment to restore the sum invested is apt to undertake investments of rela-
tively low yield. A more logical approach is to consider how long it takes an investment
to restore the sum invested and yield a certain minimum rate of return.
Let TV= life of asset, years; / and /' = required investment rate and true investment rate,
respectively; Fexp, and Finc = value of expenditures and value of income, respectively,
where all sums of money are evaluated at a specific date and by using / as the interest rate.
If Fexp = Finc, then /' = /. Thus, the problem is to find the value of Af at which this equality
of expenditures and income becomes a fact.

2. Perform the calculations

Evaluate all sums of money at the date of purchase, using an interest rate of 10 percent.
Set N= 1. Then Kexp, = $40,000 - $3500(SPPW, n = 1) = $40,000 - $3500(0.90909) =
$36,818. Also, = $12,000(0.90909) = $10,909. Since Fexp > Finc, i' < 10 percent.
Now set N = 2. Then Fexp - $40,000 - $3000(SPPW, n = 2) = $40,000 -
$3000(0.82645) = $37,521. Applying the previous result and adding the income at the
end of the second year, we find Finc = $10,909 + $12,000(0.82645) = $20,826. Thus, /' <
10 percent.
Set N= 3. Then Fexp = $40,000 - $2500(0.75131) = $38,122. Also, Finc = $20,826 +
$8000(0.75131) = $26,836.
Continue these calculations to obtain the results in Table 15. This table shows that i' <
10 percent when N= 5 and i' > 10 percent when N= 6. Thus, the asset must be held 6
years to secure a 10 percent rate of return.

BENEFIT-COST A NALYSIS

A proposed flood-control dam is expected to have an initial cost of $5,000,000 and to re-
quire annual maintenance of $24,00.0. It will also require major repairs and reconstruction

costing $120,000 at the end of every 10-year period. The life of the dam may be assumed
to be infinite. The reduction in losses due to flood damage is estimated to be $300,000 per
year. However, there will be an immediate loss of $100,000 in the value of the property
surrounding the dam, and this loss will be borne by the public. Applying an interest rate
of 6 percent, determine whether the proposed dam is feasible.

Calculation Procedure:

1. Compute the present worth of costs

With reference to a federal project, any income or reduction in loss that accrues to the
public is called a benefit, any loss that accrues to the public is called a disbenefit, and the
difference between the benefits and disbenefits is called the net benefit. The ratio of net
benefit to costs is called the benefit-cost (BIC) ratio. If this ratio exceeds 1, the project is
considered desirable.
A uniform-payment series that continues indefinitely is called & perpetuity. The value
of a perpetuity at its origin date (i.e., one payment period before the first payment) is

Analysis of Business Operations

LINEAR PROGRAMMING TO MAXIMIZE
INCOME FROM JOINT PRODUCTS

A firm manufactures two articles, A and B. The unit cost of production, exclusive of fixed
costs, is $10 for A and $7 for B. The unit selling price is $16 for A and $13.50 for B. The
estimated maximum monthly sales potential of A is 9000 units; of B, 7000 units. It is the
policy of the firm to produce only as many units as can readily be sold. If production is
restricted to one article, the factory can turn out 13,000 units of A or 8500 units of B per
month. The capital allotted to monthly production after payment of fixed costs is
$100,000. What monthly production of each article will yield the maximum profit?

Calculation Procedure:

1. Express the production constraints imposed by sales
and capital

Let NA and NB denote the number of articles A and B, respectively, produced monthly.
Then potential sales: NA < 9000, Eq. a; NB < 7000, Eq. b. Available capital: 1OW4 + 1NB
<$ 100,000, Eq. c.

2. Determine the production constraint imposed
by the plant capacity

The number of months required to produce NA units of A is NA/13,000. Likewise, to pro-
duce NB units of B would be #0/8500. Then, W4/13,000 + Afc/8500 < 1, or S.5NA + 137V5
< 110,500, Eq. d.

3. Express the monthly profit in equation form

Before fixed costs are deducted, the profit P = (16 - IQ)NA + (13.5 - I)N39 or P = 6NA +
6.5NB9 Eq. e.

4. Construct a monthly production chart

Considering the expressions a to d above to be equalities, plot the straight lines represent-
ing them (Fig. 8).
Since these expressions actually establish upper limits to the values ofNA and NB, the
point representing the joint production of articles A and B must lie either within the shad-
ed area, which is termed the feasible region, or on one of its boundary lines.

5. Plot an equal-profit line

Assign the arbitrary value of $30,000 to P, and plot the straight line corresponding to Eq.
e above. Every point on this line (Fig. 8) represents a set of values for NA and N8 for
which the profit is $30,000. This line is therefore termed an equal-profit line.
Next, consider that P assumes successively greater values. As P does so, the equal-
profit line moves away from the origin while remaining parallel to its initial position.

6. Maximize the profit potential

To maximize the profit, locate the point in Fig. 8 at which the equal-profit line, in its out-
ward displacement, is on the verge of leaving the feasible region. This is point g, which
lies at the intersection of the lines representing the equalities c and d.

7. Determine the number of units for maximum profit

Establish the coordinates of the maximum-profit point Q either by reading them from the

manufactured by any means.

ALLOCATION OF PRODUCTION
AMONG MULTIPLE FACILITIES
WITH NONLINEAR COSTS

A firm must produce 700 units per month of a commodity, and three machines, A, B, and
C, are available for this purpose. Production costs are CA = 0.287V4
1-42 + 400; CB =
0.367V-47 + 50 °; cc = 0.307Vj-53 + 420, where N = number of units produced monthly;

C = monthly cost of production, $; and the subscript refers to the machine. Find the most
economical manner of allocating production among the three machines.

Calculation Procedure:

1. Write the equations of Incremental costs

The objective is to minimize the total cost of production. Since costs vary nonlinearly,
this situation does not lend itself to linear programming.
Assume that TV units have been produced on a given machine. The incremental (or
marginal) cost at that point is the cost of producing the (TV+ /)th unit. Let I= incremental
cost, $. If TV is large, / ^ dCldN. By differentiating the foregoing expressions, this approx-
imation gives IA = 0.3976TV4
0-42, IB = 0.5292TV5
0-47, Ic = 0.4590TV<?53, where the subscript
refers to the machine. Also, if TV is large, cost of producing TVth unit — cost of producing
(TV+ l ) t h u n i t.

2. Establish the condition at which the total cost of production
is minimum

Arbitrarily set TV4 = 150, NB = 250, TVC = 300, which gives a total of 700 units. The incre-
mental costs are IA = $3,2614, IB = $7.0901, and Ic = $9.4338. Also, when TV4 = 151, then
IA = $3.2705. The total cost of production can be reduced by shifting 1 unit from machine
B to machine A and 1 unit from machine C to machine A, with the reduction being ap-
proximately $7.0901 + $9.4338 - ($3.2614 + 3.2705) = $9.9920. Thus, the arbitrary set of
TV values given above does not yield the minimum total cost.
Clearly the total cost of production is minimum when all three incremental costs are
equal (or as equal as possible, since TV is restricted to integral values).

3. Find the most economical allocation of production

At minimum total cost, IA=IB = Ic or 0.3976TV4
0-42 = 0.5292TV5
0-47 = 0.4590TVC°53, Eq. a;
and NA+ NB + NC = 700, Eq. b. By a trial-and-error solution, TV4 = 468, TV5 = 132, and
TVC=100.
Alternatively, proceed as follows: From Eq. a, TV5 = 0.5442Af4
0-8936 and TVC =
0.7627TV4
0-7925. Substituting in Eq. b gives TV4 + 0.5442TV4
0-8936 + 0.7627TV0-7925 = 700. As-
sign trial values to TV4 until this equation is satisfied. The solution is TV4 = 468, and the re-
maining values follow.

4. Devise a semigraphical method of solution

In Fig. 9, plot the incremental-cost curves. Pass an arbitrary horizontal line L through
these curves to obtain a set of TV values at which T4 = IB = Ic. Scale the TV values, and find
their sum. Now displace the horizontal line until the sum of the TV values is 700.
Related Calculations: Allocation problems of this type usually are solved by ap-
plying Lagrange multipliers. However, as the previous solution demonstrates, the use of
simple economic logic can circumvent the need for abstract mathematical concepts.

OPTIMAL PRODUCTMIX

monthly, P = monthly profit, and the subscript refers to the article. If production is re-
stricted to one article, the firm can produce 1000 units of A, 1500 units of B, and 1800
units of C per month. What monthly production of each article will yield the maximum
profit?

Calculation Procedure:

1. Express the constraint imposed on production

Let T = number of months required to produce TV units of an article, with a subscript to
identify the article. Then TA = TVyiOOO; T8 = AT5ASOO; and Tc = TVC/1800. Since 1 month
is available, TVyiOOO + TV1500 + TVC/1800 = 1, or 1.87V4 + \.2NB + Nc = 1800, Eq. a.

2. Determine how the values of N can vary

Assume for simplicity that NA is restricted to integral values but NB and NB can assume
nonintegral values. Equation a reveals that if NA increases by 1 unit, N8 must decrease by
1.8/1.2 = 1.5 units, or NB must decrease by 1.8 units. Expressed formally, the partial de-
rivatives are SNBldNA = -1.5 and dNcldNA = -1.8.

3. Write the equations of incremental profits

If TV units of an article have been produced, the incremental profit at that point is the prof-
it that accrues from producing the (TV+ l)th unit. Let /= incremental profit. If TV is large, 7
— dPldN. By differentiating the foregoing expressions, the incremental profits are IA -
475 - 0.010OTV^, I8 = 2.60 - 0.0028TV5, and Ic = 2.25 - 0.002OTV0 where the subscript
refers to the article. Also, if TV is large, the profit from the TVth unit =* profit from the (TV+
l)th unit.

4. Establish the condition at which the total profit is maximum

Arbitrarily set TV4 = 300, TV5 = 400, TVC = 780, satisfying Eq. a. The incremental profits are

IA = $1750; IB = $1480 and l.5IB = $2220; /c = $0690 and 18/c = $1.242. Also, when7V5
= 401.5, then 1.5I3 = $2.214. The total profit can be increased by reducing NA by 1 unit,
reducing Nc by 1.8 units, and increasing NB by 2(1.5) = 3 units, with the increase in prof-
it being approximately $2.220 + $2.214 - ($1.750 + $1.242) = $1.442. Thus, the arbitrary
set of N values given above does not yield the maximum profit.
So the total profit is maximum when IA = \.5IB = 1.81/c, or 4.75 - 0.010OTVx, = 3.90 -
0.00427V5 = 4.05 - 0.0036TV0 Eq. b.

5. Find the production that will maximize profit

Applying Eq. Z?, express TV5 and Nc in terms OfTV4. Substitute these expressions in Eq. a,
and solve the resulting equation for NA. Then calculate NB and Nc. The results are NA =
301,TV5 = 514 ,andTVc = 641.

6. Devise a semigraphical method of solution

In Fig. 10, plot the straight lines that represent IA l.5IB, and 1.8/c Pass an arbitrary hori-
zontal line L through these lines to obtain a set of TV values at which T4 = l.5IB — 1.8/c
Scale the TV values, and determine whether they satisfy Eq. a. Now displace the horizontal
line until the TV values do satisfy this equation.

DYNAMIC PROGRAMMING TO MINIMIZE
COST OF TRANSPORTATION

A firm must ship merchandise by truck from town A to town E, and the trip will last 4
days. The driver will stop in district B the first night, district C the second night, and dis-
trict D the third night. The number of towns in each district is: district B, three; district C,
two; district D, three. The driver can stay overnight in any of these towns, and the cost of

lodging is the same in all. The relative cost of traveling from one town to another is
recorded in Fig. 11. Design the most economical route.

Calculation Procedure:

1. Determine the minimum cost of transportation from towns Cl
and C2 to town E

The design will be executed by dynamic programming, which was applied in an earlier
calculation procedure to identity the most lucrative combination of investments. The most
economical route from A to E will be constructed in stages, in reverse order.
The cost of transportation from Cl to E is as follows: for C l-D l-E, 14 + 10 = 24; for
C1-D2-E, 15 + 11 = 26; for C1-D3-E, 18 + 13 = 31. Thus, the minimum cost is 24. The
cost of transportation from C2 to E is: for C2-D1-E, 11 + 10 = 21; for C2-D2-E, 1 9 + 11 =
30; for C2-D3-E, 16 + 13 = 29. Thus, the minimum cost is 21. Record these minimum
costs and their corresponding towns in district D in Fig. 12; they are the only costs that
are relevant from now on.

2. Determine the minimum cost of transportation from towns B1,
B2 and B3 to town E

Refer to Fig. 12. The cost of transportation from Bl to E is: for B l -C l -E, 12 + 24 = 36;
for B1-C2-E, 1 1 + 2 1= 32. Thus, the minimum cost is 32. The cost of transportation from
B2 to E is: for B2-C1-E, 17 + 24 = 41; for B2-C2-E, 21 + 21 = 42. Thus, the minimum
cost is 41. The cost of transportation from B3 to E is: for B3-C1-E, 10 + 24 = 34; for B3-

C2-E, 1 + 21= 28. Thus, the minimum cost is 28. Record these minimum costs and their
corresponding towns in district C in Fig. 13.

3. Determine the minimum cost of transportation from town A
to town E

Refer to Fig. 13. The cost of transportation from A to E is: for A-Bl-E, 9 + 32 = 41; for
A-B2-E, 6 + 41 = 47; for A-B3-E, 12 + 28 = 40. Thus, the minimum cost is 40, and the
corresponding town in district B is B3.

4. Identify the most economical route

Refer to step 3 and Figs. 13 and 12, in that order. The most economical route is A-B3-C2-
Dl-E. From Fig. 11, the cost of transportation corresponding to this route is 12 + 7 + 11 +
10 = 40, which agrees with the result in step 3.
Related Calculations: The number of alternative routes from town A to town E
is 3 x 2 x3 = 18. Therefore, the most economical route can be found by listing all 18
routes and computing their respective costs. However, the solution by dynamic program-
ming given above simplifies the work.

OPTIMAL INVENTORYLEVEL

A firm is under contract to supply 41,600 parts per year and plans to produce them in
equal lots spaced at equal intervals. The production capacity is 800 parts per day. Setup
and teardown cost for the production machines is $550 for each run. The cost of storage,
insurance, and interest on the investment is $1.40 per part for each year the part is carried
in inventory. The regular production cost, exclusive of setup and teardown, is $5 per part.

FIGURE 13. Second stage in finding most economical route.

A reserve stock of parts is not needed. Determine the most economical lot size and the
corresponding cost of production.

Calculation Procedure:

1. Compute the parts delivery rate

Assume that the parts are delivered to the buyer at a uniform rate, and compute the daily
delivery rate. Since there are approximately 260 working days per year, the rate of deliv-
ery = 41,600 parts/260 days = 160 parts per day.

2. Construct an inventory-time diagram

Figure 14 shows such a diagram, starting with zero inventory.

FIGURE 14. Variation in inventory level.

3. Compute the peak inventory
for a lot size of N

The time OA required to produce 1 lot, Fig.
14, = lot size/maximum production rate =
TV/800, days. The slope of OB = rate of pro-
duction - rate of delivery = 800 - 160 = 640
parts per day. Then AB = (M800)(640) =
0.87V parts.

4. Compute the total annual
cost in terms of N

The number of runs per year = 41,600/JV.
Also, the annual cost of setup and teardown
= $550(41,600/AO = 22,880,000/7V. Further,

the average inventory = Q.5AB = QAN parts. By taking the product of the carrying cost
and the average inventory, the annual cost of carrying the inventory = $1.40(0.4TV) =
0.567V. With a $5 per unit regular cost, the annual regular cost = $5(41,600 units) =
$208,000. Then the annual total cost C = (22,880,000/7V) + 0.567V+ 208,000.

5. Find the economical lot size

To minimize C, set the derivative of C with respect to TV equal to zero; solve for TV to find
the economical lot size. Thus, dCIdN= -(22,880,000/7V2) + 0.56 = O; TV= 6392 parts per
lot.

6. Compute the total annual cost

Substitute the number of parts from step 5 in the total annual-cost equation in step 4. Or,
C = 3580 + 3580 + 208,000 = $215,160.

EFFECT OF QUANTITY DISCOUNT
ON OPTIMAL INVENTORY LEVEL

Given the data from the previous calculation procedure, the firm finds that it can obtain
quantity discounts if the parts are produced in lots of 7500 or more. These discounts re-
duce the regular production cost from $5 to $4.80 per part; this saving reduces the interest
cost on inventory by $0.02 per part. Determine the most economical lot size under these
conditions.

Calculation Procedure:

1. Determine the number of parts for minimum cost

Assume that TV ^ 7500. Proceeding as before, express C in terms of TV, and set dC/dN= O.
The annual cost of carrying the inventory = $1.38(0.4TV) = 0.552TV. Also, the annual
regular cost = 41,600($4.80) = $199,680. Also, C = (22,880,000/TV) + 0.552TV+ 199,680.
And dCldN = -(22,880,000/TV2) + 0.552 = O. For minimum cost, TV- 6438 parts. Howev-
er, since discounts are not obtained until TV reaches 7500, the last calculation lacks signif-
icance for this situation.

2. Compute the economical lot size

Set N= 7500 and substitute in the cost equation above. Then C = 3051 + 4140 + 199,680
= $206,871. Since this result is less than the value of $215,160 computed in the previous
calculation procedure corresponding to 6392 parts, the economical lot size is 7500 parts.

PROJECT PLANNING BY THE
CRITICAL-PATH METHOD

Table 16 lists the activities performed in preparing a building site and installing the utili-
ties. Assuming that the estimated durations are precise, determine the minimum time
needed to complete the project. Identify the critical path. Upon completion of the project,
it was found that each activity was undertaken at the earliest possible date and that its du-
ration coincided with the estimate, except for the following: activity D was started 3 days
late; activity H required 9 days instead of 6; activity I required 5 days instead of 4. Deter-
mine the duration of the project.

Calculation Procedure:

1. Identify the predecessor(s) of each activity; tabulate results

The critical-path method (CPM) offers a systematic means of scheduling activities in a
project and analyzing the consequences of departures from the schedule. The procedure
consists of devising a logical concatenation of activities after ascertaining the relation-
ships that exist among them. For example, activities D and E, Table 16, are independent
of each other and therefore may be performed concurrently. But activities D and F are se-
quentially related—F cannot commence until D is finished. Thus, D is the immediate
predecessor of F. Using these principles, list the related activities as shown in Table 17.

2. Construct the network for the project. Fig. 15

The network is a delineation of the sequence in which the activities are to be performed.
Each activity is represented by a horizontal arrow, which may or may not be to scale. The
arrow representing a given activity is placed to the right of its immediate predecessor ac-
tivity. Where there are multiple predecessors or successors, broken arrows are used to
transfer from one activity to another. The duration of each activity is recorded under its
corresponding arrow.
Completion of an activity and the start of its successor constitute an event. Com-
mencement of a given activity is termed its i event; completion of an activity is termed its
j event. A number is assigned to each event and is recorded in the network in a circle be-
tween consecutive arrows. Each activity is identified by the events it separates. For in-
stance, 6-7 designates erect water tank. A chain of activities extending from inception to
completion of the project is termed a path. In this project there are the following five
paths:

3. Compute the early event time TE of each event

The early event time is the earliest possible date at which the event may occur. Compute
the early event time from TE(n^ = TE(n_^ + D, where TE(ri) = early event time of a given
event; = TE(n_^ = early event time of preceding event; D = duration of intervening activi-
ty. Where an event has multiple immediate predecessors, this equation yields multiple
values of TE

days; TL^ = late event time of completion in the same time as F; TE^ = early event start-
ing time, in the same time units as F. The expression in parentheses represents the earliest
possible date at which the activity may be completed. Table 20 shows the float calcula-
tions.

6. Identify the critical path

An activity is critical if any delay in its completion will extend the duration of the project.
The path on which the critical activities are located is termed the critical path. (There may
be several critical paths associated with a project.) In the terminology of CPM, a critical
activity is one having zero float. The critical path for this project is therefore 0-1-2-3-4-5-
8-13.

7. Verify the results of step 6

Plot the project activities on a time scale, Fig. 16. This diagram was constructed under the
assumption that each activity commences at the earliest possible date.
Note in Fig. 16 that the float of a given activity equals the total gap in the chain ex-
tending from the completion of that activity to the completion of the project. For instance,
6-7 has a float of 2 days, and 10-11 has a float of 5 + 6 = 11 days.

9. Determine the true duration of the project

Treating each departure individually, deduce the effects of that departure by referring to
Fig. 16. Combine these effects where they are cumulative. On the basis of these results,
establish the true duration of the project. Thus activity 3-9: events 11 and 12 would be de-
layed 3 days; activity 3-12: event 12 would not be delayed, since there is a latitude of 10
days along this path; activity 11-12: event 12 would be delayed 1 day. Summary: Event
12 is delayed 4 days; event 13 is not delayed, since there is a latitude of 6 days along this
path. Therefore, the true duration of the project = 37 days, as forecast.

PROJECT PLANNING BASED ON
AVAILABLE WORKFORCE

A manufacturing firm has a contract to build a pilot model of a newly invented ma-
chine. To plan the work, the firm constructed the CPM network in Fig. 17 and compiled
the data in Table 21. The following activities must be performed as a unit, without loss
of continuity: 0-1-2-4; 2-3-4; 5-7-8. Activities 4-8 and 6-8 may be performed piecemeal,
if this proves convenient. The workforce available for assignment to this project is 15
workers for the first 8 days, 25 for the remaining time. Each employee is capable of per-
forming all 11 activities. But the constraints imposed by the available facilities limit the
number of workers for each activity to that shown in Table 21. Overtime is not permis-
sible. Devise a schedule that will allow completion of this project at the earliest possi-
ble date.

Calculation Procedure:

1. Compute the early and late event times

The results of these calculations, made in accordance with the previous calculation proce-
dure, are shown in Fig. 17.

2. Identify the critical path

Since the critical path is the longest path through the network, Fig. 17 shows that this is O-
1-2-4-8. Note that the critical path sets a lower limit of 24 days on the duration of the
project. But the workforce limitations may lengthen the project beyond 24 days. Thus, the
objective will be to devise a schedule that fits noncritical activities into the 24-day period
while satisfying the workforce availability.

3. Schedule the project, assuming unlimited workforce

As a first trial, assume that unlimited workforce is available, and schedule each activity to
start at the earliest possible date. Construct the workforce-time diagram for this condi-
tion, as shown in Fig. 18#. Study of the diagram shows that this schedule is unsatisfactory
because the workforce requirements exceed the available workers on days 12 to 15, inclu-
sive.

4. Schedule the project with the latest possible start

Assume unlimited workforce again, and schedule each activity to start at the latest possi-
ble date. Construct the corresponding workforce-time diagram, Fig. 18&. Study of the dia-
gram shows that this schedule is also unsatisfactory, but it is an improvement over the
schedule instep 3.
Although both these schedules are unsatisfactory, they are useful because their work-
force-time diagrams reveal the boundaries of each activity or chain of activities based on
a project duration of 24 days. For example, the chain 5-7-8 may start at any time between
days 12 and 21, Fig. 18. This information is not explicitly supplied by the network, since
the late event time for event 5 is determined by the chain 5-6-8.

5. Shift noncritical activities to obtain a suitable schedule

Using the allowable workforce limits, shift noncritical activities such that the project can
be completed in 24 days using the available workers.

Construct the schedule shown in Fig. 19. Note that the workforce requirements are
less than the available personnel. Further, the schedule preserves the integrity of the three
chains of activities mentioned earlier. Although fragmentation of activity 6-8 is permissi-
ble, it proved unnecessary. With the schedule shown, the project will be finished in 24
days.

ect requiring allocation of workforce or other resources.

Statistics, Probability, and Their Applications

Basic Statistics

If the value assumed by a variable on a given occasion cannot be predicted because it is
influenced by chance, the variable is known as a random, or stochastic, variable. The
number of times the variable assumes a given value is called the frequency of that value.
A number that may be considered representative of all values of the variable is called an
average. There are several types of averages, such as arithmetic mean, geometric mean,
harmonic mean, median, mode, etc. Each is used for a specific purpose. The standard de-
viation is a measure of the dispersion, or scatter, of the values of the random variable; it is
approximately equal to the amount by which a given value of the variable may be expect-
ed to differ from the arithmetic mean, in either direction. The variance is the square of the
standard deviation. Where no mention of frequency appears, it is understood that all fre-
quencies are 1.

Calculation Procedure:

1. Compute the arithmetic mean

Let X= number of units_sold monthly. Find the sum of the values of X9 which is 301.
Then s e tX = QX)In, or X = 301/7 = 43.

2. Find the median

Consider that all values of X are arranged in ascending order of magnitude. If n is odd, the
value that occupies the central position in this array is called the median. If n is even, the
median is taken as the arithmetic mean of the two values that occupy the central positions.
In either case, the total frequency of values below the median equals the total frequency
of values above the median. The median is useful as an average because the arithmetic
mean can be strongly influenced by an extreme value at one end of the array and thereby
offer a misleading view of the data.
In the present instance, the array is 32, 37, 41, 44, 47, 49, 51. The fourth value in the
array is 44; then Xmed = 44.

3. Compute the standard deviation

Compute the deviations of the X values from X, and record the results in column 3 of
Table 22. The sum of the deviations must be O. Now square the deviations, and record the
results in column 4. Find the sum of the squared deviations, which is 278. Set the variance
s2 = &d2)/n = 278/7. Then set the standard deviation s = V278/7 = 6.30.

4. Compute the arithmetic mean by using an assumed
arithmetic mean

SQtA = 40. Compute the deviations of the Jf values from A9 recordjthe results in column 5
of Table 22, and find the sum of the deviations, which is 21. Set X = A + (2dA)/n, or X =
40 + 21/7 = 43.

5. Compute the standard deviation by using the arithmetic mean
assumed in step 3

Square the deviations from A9 record the results in column 6 of Table 22, and find their
sum, which is 341. Set s2 = (ZdJ)In - [&dA)/n]2 = 341/7 - (21/7)2 = 341/7 - 9 = 278/7.
Thens = V278/7 = 6.30.
Related Calculations: Note that the equation applied in step 5 does not contain
the true mean X. This equation serves to emphasize that the standard deviation is purely a
measure of dispersion and thus is independent of the arithmetic mean. For example, if all

values of Xincrease by a constant /z, then X increases by h, but s remains constant. Where
X has a nonintegral value, the use of an assumed arithmetic mean A of integral value can
result in a faster and more accurate calculation of s.

DETERMINATION OFARITHMETIC
MEAN AND STANDARD DEVIATION
OF GROUPED DATA

In testing a new industrial process, a firm assigned a standard operation to 24 employees
in its factory and recorded the time required by each employee to complete the operation.
The results are presented in columns 1 and 2 of Table 23. Find the arithmetic mean and
standard deviation of the time of completion.

Calculation Procedure:

1. Record the class midpoints

Where the number of values assumed by a variable is very large, a comprehensive listing
of these values becomes too cumbersome. Therefore, the data are presented by grouping
the values in classes and showing the frequency of each class. The range of values of a
given class is its class interval, and the end values of the interval are the class limits. The
difference between the upper and lower limits is the class width, or class size. Thus, in
Table 23, all classes have a width of 4 min. The arithmetic mean of the class limits is the
midpoint, or mark. In analyzing grouped data, all values that fall within a given class are
replaced with the class midpont. The midpoints are recorded in column 3 of Table 23, and
they are denoted by X.

2. Compute the arithmetic mean

Set ^ = (S/9/W, or X = (3 x 22 + 9 x 26 + 7 x 30 + 5 x 34)724 = 680/24 = 28.33 min.

3. Compute the standard deviation

Set s2J=GfJ2Vn, ors2 = [3(-6.33)2 + 9(-2.33)2 + 7(1.67)2 + 5(5.67)2]/24 = 14.5556. Then
j = Vl4.5556 = 3.82min.

4. Compute the arithmetic mean by the coding method

This method simplifies the analysis of grouped data where all classes are of uniform
width, as in the present case. Arbitrarily selecting the third class, assign the integer O to

this class, and then assign integers to the remaining classes in consecutive and ascending
order, as shown in column 4 of Table 23. These integers are the class codes. Let c = class
code, w = class width, and A = midpoint of class having the code O. Compute X/c, or 2/c
= 3(-2) + 9(-l) + 7(0) + 5(1) - -10. Now set X = A + w@fc)/n> or X = 30 + 4(-10)/24 =
28.33 min.

5. Compute the standard deviation by the coding method

Using the codes previously assigned, compute 2/c2, or 2/c2 = 3(-2)2 + 9(-l)2 + 7(O)2 +
5(1)2 = 26. Now set s2 = w*{(2fi?yn - [&fc)/n]2}. Then s2 = 16[26/24 - (-10/24)2] =
14.5556, and s = V14.5556 = 3.82 min.

Permutations and Combinations

An arrangement of objects or individuals in which the order or rank is significant is called
a permutation. A grouping of objects or individuals in which the order or rank is not sig-
nificant, or in which it is predetermined, is called a combination. Assume that n objects
are available and that r of these objects are selected to form a permutation or combination.
If interest centers on only the identity of the r objects selected, a combination is formed; if
interest centers on both the identity and the order or rank of the r objects, a permutation is
formed. In the following material, the r objects all differ from one another.
Where necessary, the number of permutations or combinations that can be formed is
computed by applying the following law, known as the multiplication law: If one task can
be performed in ml different ways and another task can be performed in m2 different
ways, the set of tasks can be performed in W1W2 different ways.

2. Compute the number of possible assignments
if Smith is selected

If Smith is assigned to machine A, the number of possible assignments to B and C = 3 x 7
= 21. If Smith is assigned to machine B, the number of possible assignments to A and C =
5 x 7 = 35. if Smith is assigned to machine C, the number of possible assignments to A
and B = 5x3 = 15. Thus, the number of possible assignments with Smith selected = 21 +
35 '+15 = 71.

3. Compute the total number of possible assignments

By summation, the number of ways in which operators can be assigned to the three ma-
chines = 105 + 71 = 176.

FORMATION OF PERMUTATIONS SUBJECT
TO A RESTRICTION

Permutations are to be formed of the first seven letters of the alphabet, taken four at a
time, with the restriction that d cannot be placed anywhere to the left of c. For example,
the permutation edge is unacceptable. How many permutations can be formed?

Calculation Procedure:

1. Compute the number of permutations in the absence
of any restriction

Use the relation Pn, = n\l(n - r)!, or P1^ = 7!/3! - 7 x 6 x 5 x 4- 840.

2. Compute the number of permutations that violate
the imposed restriction

Form permutations that violate the restriction. Start by placing d in the first position. Let-
ter c can be placed in any of the three subsequent positions. Two positions now remain
unoccupied, and five letters are available; these positions can be filled in 5 x 4 = 20 ways.
Thus, the number of permutations in which d occupies the first position and c some sub-
sequent position is 3 x 20 = 60. Similarly, the number of permutations in which d occu-
pies the second position and c occupies the third or fourth position is 2 x 20 = 40, and the
number of permutations in which d occupies the third position and c occupies the fourth
position is 1 x 20 = 20.
By summation, the number of unacceptable permutations = 60 + 40 + 20 = 120.

3. Compute the number of permutations that satisfy
the requirement

By subtraction, the number of acceptable permutations = 840 - 120 = 720.

FORMATION OF COMBINATIONS SUBJECT
TO A RESTRICTION

A committee is to consist of 6 individuals of equal rank, and 15 individuals are available
for assignment. However, McCarthy will serve only if Polanski is also on the committee.
In how many ways can the committee be formed?

Calculation Procedure:

1. Compute the number of possible committees in the absence
of any restriction

Since the members will be of equal rank, each committee represents a combination. Use
the relation Cnr = n\/[rl(n-r)\], or C1 5 6= 15!/(6!9!) = (15 x 14 x 13 x 12 x U x lQ)/(6 x
5 x 4 x 3 x 2) = 5005.

2. Compute the number of possible committees that violate
the imposed restriction

Assign McCarthy to the committee, but exclude Polanski. Five members remain to be se-
lected, and 13 individuals are available. The number of such committees = C135 =
13!/(5!8!) = ( 1 3x 12 x U x 10 x 9)/(5 x 4 x 3 x 2) = 1287.

3. Compute the number of possible committees that satisfy
the requirement

By subtraction, the number of ways in which the committee can be formed = 5005 - 1287
-3718.

Probability

If the outcome of a process cannot be predicted because it is influenced by chance, the
process is called a trial, or experiment. The outcome of a trial or set of trials is an event.
Two events are mutually exclusive if the occurrence of one excludes the occurrence of the
other. Two events are independent of each other if the occurrence of one has no effect on
the likelihood that the other will occur.
Assume that a box contains 17 objects, 12 of which are spheres. If an object is to be
drawn at random and all objects have equal likelihood of being drawn, then the probabili-
ty that a sphere will be drawn is 12/17. Thus, the probability of a given event can range
from O to 1. The lower limit corresponds to an impossible event, and the upper limit cor-
responds to an event that is certain to occur. If two events are mutually exclusive, the
probability that either will occur is the sum of their respective probabilities. If two events
are independent of each other, the probability that both will occur is the product of their
respective probabilities.
Assume that a random variable is discrete and the number of values it can assume is fi-
nite. A listing of these values and their respective probabilities is called the probability
distribution of the variable. Where the number of possible values is infinite, the probabil-
ity distribution is expressed by stating the functional relationship between a value of the
variable and the corresponding probability. Where the random variable is continuous, the
method of expressing its probability distribution is illustrated in the calculation procedure
below pertaining to the normal distribution.

Notational System

Here E = given event; X = random variable; P(E) = probability that event E will occur;
P(X1) = probability that X will assume the value X1; IJL and cr = arithmetic mean and stan-
dard deviation, respectively, of a probability distribution.

PROBABILITY OF A SEQUENCE OF EVENTS

A box contains 12 bolts. Of these, 8 have square heads and 4 have hexagonal heads. Sev-
en bolts will be removed from the box, individually and at random. What is the probabili-
ty that the second and third bolts drawn will have square heads and the sixth bolt will
have a hexagonal head?

Calculation Procedure:

1. Compute the total number of ways in which the bolts
can be drawn

The sequence in which the bolts are drawn represents a permutation of 12 bolts taken 7 at
a time, and each bolt is unique. The total number of permutations = P12J — 121/5!.

2. Compute the number of ways in which the bolts can be drawn
in the manner specified

If the bolts are drawn in the manner specified, the second and third positions in the per-
mutation are occupied by square-head bolts and the sixth position is occupied by a hexag-
onal-head bolt. Construct such a permutation, in these steps: Place a square-head bolt in
the second position; the number of bolts available is 8. Now place a square-head bolt in
the third position; the number of bolts available is 7. Now place a hexagonal-head bolt in
the sixth position; the number of bolts available is 4. Finally, fill the four remaining posi-
tions in any manner whatever; the number of bolts available is 9.
The second position can be filled in 8 ways, the third position in 7 ways, the sixth po-
sition in 4 ways, and the remaining positions in P94 ways. By the multiplication law, the
number of acceptable permutations is 8 x 7 * 4 x P94 = 224(9!/5!).

3. Compute the probability of drawing the bolts
in the manner specified

Since all permutations have an equal likelihood of becoming the true permutation, the
probability equals the ratio of the number of acceptable permutations to the total number
of permutations. Thus, probability = 224(9!/5!)/(12!/5!) = 224(9!)/!2! = 224(12 x U x
10) = 224/1320-0.1697.

4. Compute the probability by an alternative approach

As the preceding calculations show, the exact positions specified (second, third, and
sixth) do not affect the result. For simplicity, assume that the first and second bolts are to
be square-headed and the third bolt hexagonal-headed. The probabilities are: first bolt
square-headed, 8/12; second bolt square-headed, 7/11; third bolt hexagonal-headed, 4/10.
The probability that all three events will occur is the product of their respective probabili-
ties. Thus, the probability that bolts will be drawn in the manner specified =
(8/12)(7/l 1)(4/10) = 224/1320 = 0.1697. Note also that the precise number of bolts drawn
from the box (7) does not affect the result.

PROBABILITY ASSOCIATED
WITH A SERIES OF TRIALS

During its manufacture, a product passes through five departments, A, B, C, D, and E.
The probability that the product will be delayed in a department is: A, 0.06; B, 0.15; C,
0.03; D. 0.07; E, 0.13. These values are independent of one another in the sense that the

time for which the product is held in one department has no effect on the time it spends in
any subsequent department. What is the probability that there will be a delay in the manu-
facture of this product?

Calculation Procedure:

1. Compute the probability that the product will be manufactured
without any delay

Since it is certain that the product either will or will not be delayed in a department and
the probability of certainty is 1, probability of no delay = 1 - probability of delay. Thus,
the probability that the product will pass through department B without delay = 1 - 0.15 =
0.85. The probability that the product will pass through every department without delay is
the product of the probabilities of these individual events. Thus, probability of no delay in
manufacture - (0.94)(0.85)(0.97)(0.93)(0.87) = 0.6271.

2. Compute the probability of a delay in manufacture

Probability of delay in manufacture = 1 - probability of no delay in manufacture = 1 -
0.6271-0.3729.
Related Calculations: This method of calculation can be applied to any situation
where a series of trials occurs, either simultaneously or in sequence, and any trial can
cause the given event. Thus, assume that several projectiles are fired simultaneously and
the probability of landing in a target area is known for each projectile. The above method
can be used to find the probability that at least one projectile will land in the target area.

BINOMIAL PROBABILITYDISTRIBUTION

A case contains 14 units, 9 of which are of type A. Five units will be drawn at random
from the case; and as a unit is drawn, it will be replaced with one of identical type. IfX
denotes the number of type A units drawn, find the probability distribution of X and the
average value of X in the long run.

Calculation Procedure:

1. Compute the probability corresponding to a particular value
ofX

Consider that n independent trials are performed, and let X denote the number of times an
event E occurs in these n trials. The probability distribution of X is called binomial In this
case, since each unit drawn is replaced with one of identical type, each drawing is inde-
pendent of all preceding drawings; therefore, X has a binomial probability distribution.
The event E consists of drawing a type A unit.
With respect to every drawing, probability of drawing a type A unit = 9/14, and prob-
ability of drawing a unit of some other type = 5/14. Arbitrarily set Jf = 3, and assume that
the units are drawn thus: A-A-A-N-N, where N denotes a type other than A. The proba-
bility of drawing the units in this sequence = (9/14)(9/14)(9/14)(5/14)(5/14) =
(9/14)3(5/14)2. Clearly this is also the probability of drawing 3 type A units in any other
sequence. Since the type A units can occupy any 3 of the 5 positions in the set of draw-
ings and the exact positions do not matter, the number of sets of drawings that contain 3

type A units = C53. Summing the probabilities, we find P(3) = C53(9/14)3(5/14)2 =
[5!/(3!2!)](9/14)3(5/14)2 = 0.3389.

2. Write the equation of binomial probability distribution

Generalize from step 1 to obtain P(X) = Cn^(I - P)n~x where P = probability event E
will occur on a single trial. Here P = 9/14.

3. Apply the foregoing equation to find the probability
distribution of X

The results are P(O) = 1(9/14)°(5/14)5 = 0.0058. Similarly, P(Y) = 0.0523; P(2) = 0.1883;
P(3) = 0.3389 from step 1; P(4) = 0.3050; P(S) = 0.109C

4. Verify the values of probability

Since it is certain that X will assume some value from O to 5, inclusive, the foregoing
probabilities must total 1. There sum is found to be 1.0001, and the results are thus con-
firmed.

5. Compute the average value of X in the long run

Consider that there are an infinite number of cases of the type described and that 5 units
will be drawn from each case in the manner described, thereby generating an infinite set
of values of X. Since the chance of obtaining a type A unit on a single drawing is 9/14, the
average number of type A units that will be obtained in 5 drawings is 5(9/14) = 45/14 =
3.21. Thus, the arithmetic mean of this infinite set of values of X is 3.21.
Alternatively, find the average value of X by multiplying all X values by their respec-
tive probabilities, to get 0.0523 + 2(0.1883) + 3(0.3389) + 4(0.3050) + 5(0.1098) = 3.21.
The arithmetic mean of an infinite set of Jf values is also called the expected value of X.

PASCAL PROBABILITY DISTRIBUTION

Objects are ejected randomly from a rotating mechanism, and the probability that an ob-
ject will enter a stationary receptacle after leaving the mechanism is 0.35. The process of
ejecting objects will continue until four objects have entered the receptacle. Let X denote
the number of objects that must be ejected. Find (a) the probability corresponding to
every X value from 4 to 10, inclusive; (b) the probability that more than 10 objects must
be ejected; (c) the average value of Xin the long run.

Calculation Procedure:

1. Compute the probability corresponding to a particular
value of X

Consider that a trial is performed repeatedly, each trial being independent of all preceding
trials, until a given event E has occurred for the Mi time. Let X denote the number of tri-
als required. The variable X is said to have a Pascal probability distribution. (In the spe-
cial case where k = 1, the probability distribution is called geometric.) In the present situ-
ation, the given event is entrance of the object into the receptacle, and k = 4.
Use this code: A signifies the object has entered; B signifies it has not. Arbitrarily set
X = 9, and consider this sequence of events: A-B-B-A-B-B-B-A-A, which contains four
A's and five B's. The probability of this sequence, and of every sequence containing four
A's and five B's, is (0.35)4(0.65)5. Other arrangements corresponding to X= 9 can be ob-
tained by holding the fourth A in the ninth position and rearranging the preceding letters,
which consist of three A's and five B's. Since the A's can be assigned to any 3 of the 8

positions, the number of arrangements that can be formed is C83. Thus, P(9) =
C83(0.35)4(0.65)5 = 56(0.35)4(0.65)5 = 0.0975.

2. Write the equation of Pascal probability distribution

Generalize from step 1 to obtain P(X) = C^^P^l - Pf-*, where P = probability that
event E will occur on a single trial. Here P = 0.35.

3. Apply the foregoing equation to find the probabilities
corresponding to the given X values

The results are P(4) = 1(0.35)4(0.65)° = 0.0150; P(5) = 4(0.35^(0.6S)1 = 0.0390; P(G) =
10(0.35)4(0.65)2 = 0.0634. Similarly, P(I) = 0.0824; P(S) = 0.0938; P(9) = 0.0975 from
step 1; P(IO) = 0.0951.
Thus, as X increases, P(X) increases until X= 9, and then it decreases. The variable X
can assume an infinite number of values in theory, and the corresponding probabilities
form a converging series having a sum of 1.

4. Compute the probability that IO or fewer ejections
will be required

Sum the values in step 3; P(X < 10) = 0.4862.

5. Compute the probability that more than 10 ejections
will be required

Since it is certain that X will assume a value of 10 or less or a value of more than 10,
P(X> 1 O ) - I- 0.4862 = 0.5138.

6. Compute the average number of ejections required
in the long run

Consider that the process of placing a set of four objects in the receptacle is continued in-
definitely, thereby generating an infinite set of values of X. Since there is a 35 percent
chance that a specific object will enter the receptacle after being ejected from the mecha-
nism, it will require an average of 1/0.35 = 2.86 ejections to place one object in the recep-
tacle and an average of 4(1/0.35) = 11.43 ejections to place four objects in the receptacle.
Thus, the infinite set of values of X has an arithmetic mean of 11.43.

POISSON PROBABILITY DISTRIBUTION

A radioactive substance emits particles at an average rate of 0.08 particles per second. As-
suming that the number of particles emitted during a given time interval has a Poisson
distribution, find the probability that the substance will emit more than three particles in a
20-s interval.

Calculation Procedure:

1. Compute the average number of particles emitted in 20 s

Let T denote an interval of time, in suitable units. Consider that an event E occurs ran-
domly in time but the average number of occurrences of E in time T9 as measured over a
relatively long period, remains constant. Let m = average (or expected) number of occur-
rences of E in T9 and X = true number of occurrences of E in T. The variable X is said to
have a Poisson probability distribution.
In the present case, X= number of particles emitted in 20 S9 and m = 20(0.08) = 1.6.

2. Compute the probability that X < 3

Use the relation P(X) = n^l\em

Calculation Procedure:

1. Compute the values of z corresponding to the specified
boundary values of X

If a random variable X is continuous, the probability that X will assume a value between
Xj and Xk is represented graphically by constructing a probability diagram in this manner:
Plot values o fXon the horizontal axis; then construct a curve such that P(Xj <X<Xk) =
area bounded by the curve, the horizontal axis, and vertical lines at Xj and Xk. The ordi-
nate of this curve is denoted by f(X) and is called the probability density function. The to-
tal area under the curve is 1, the probability of certainty.
A continuous random variable has a normal or gaussian probability distribution if the
range of its possible values is infinite and its probability curve has an equation of this
form: f (X) = (\lb^/2^^)Q-<x-^2'2b2 where a and b are constants and e = base of natural log-
arithms. Figure 20 is the probability diagram; the curve is bell-shaped and symmetric
about a vertical line through the summit.
Consider that the trial that yields a value of X is repeated indefinitely, generating an in-
finite set of values of X. Let JJL and a = arithmetic mean and standard deviation, respec-
tively, of this set of values. The summit of the probability curve lies at X= p. By symme-
try, the area under the curve to the left and to the right of X =IJL is 0.5.
The deviation of X, from JJL is expressed in standard units in this form: Z1 = (X1 - 
IJL)/cr.
Thus, for JT= 14, z = O; for X= 17, z - (17 - 14)72.5 = 1.20; for ,T= 12, z = (12 - 14)72.5
= -0.80; etc. Record the z values in Table 24.

2. Find the values ofA(z)

Let A(ZJ) = area under probability curve from centerline (where X= JJL) to X=X1; this area
= P(IJL <X<Xi). Obtain the values of A(Z) from the table of areas under the normal prob-
ability curve. Refer to Table 25, which is an excerpt from this table. Thus, if z = 1.60, A(Z)
= 0.44520; if z = 1.78, A(z) = 0.46246. Note that A(-zt) = A(Z) by symmetry. Record the
values of A(Z) in Table 24.

3. Compute the required probabilities

Refer to Fig. 21. Apply the areas in Table 24 to obtain these results: P(14 < X< 17) =
0.38493; P(12 <X< 16.2) = 0.28814 + 0.31057 = 0.59871; P(X< 10) = 0.5 - 0.44520 -
0.05480.

Related Calculations'. Many random variables that occur in nature have a nor-
mal probability distribution. For example, the height, weight, and intelligence of mem-
bers of a species have normal distributions. Although in theory this distribution applies
solely where the range of X values is infinite, in practice the distribution is applied as a
valid approximation where the range of lvalues is finite.

APPLICATION OF NORMAL DISTRIBUTION

The time required to perform a manual operation is assumed to have a normal distribu-
tion. Studies of past performance disclose that the average time required is 5.80 h and the
standard deviation is 0.50 h. Find the probability (to three decimal places) that the opera-
tion will be performed within 5.25 h.

Calculation Procedure:

1. Compute the value of z corresponding to the boundary
value of X

Let X= time required to perform the operation, and refer to the preceding calculation pro-
cedure for the definition of z. For J f- 5.25, z = (5.25 - 5.80)7050 = -1.10.

Refer to the table of areas under the normal probability curve, and take the absolute value
of z. If z =1.10, ,4(z) = 0.364.

3. Compute the required probability

The area under consideration lies to the left of a vertical line at X= 5.25, and the area
found in step 2 lies between this line and the centerline. Then P(X< 5.25) = 0.5 - 0.364 =
0.136.

NEGATIVE-EXPONENTIAL DISTRIBUTION

The mean life span of an electronic device that operates continuously is 2 months. If the
life span of the device has a negative-exponential distribution, what is the probability that
the life span will exceed 3 months?

Calculation Procedure:

1. Write the equation of cumulative probability

Refer to the calculation procedure on the normal distribution for definitions pertaining to
a continuous random variable. A variable X is said to have a negative-exponential (or sim-
ply exponential) probability distribution if its probability density function is of this form:
f(X) = O if X< O and/^Y) = ae'^if X > O Eq. a, where a = positive constant and e = base
of natural logarithms. Figure 22 shows the probability diagram. The arithmetic mean of X
is jji = I/a, Eq. b.
Let X = life span of device, months, and let K denote any positive number. Integrate
Eq. a between the limits of O and K, giving P(X < K)=I- e~aK, Eq. c. Then P(X >K) =
e-°K, Eq. d.

2. Compute the required probability

Compute a by Eq. b, giving a = I/JJL = 1/2 = 0.5. Set K = 3 months. By Eq. d, P(X> 3) =
^r1-5 = !/*?1-5 = 0.2231.

Statistical Inference

Consider that there exists a set of objects, which is called the population, or universe.
Also consider that interest centers on some property of these objects, such as length, mo-
lecular weight, etc., and that this property assumes many values. Thus, associated with the
population is a set of numbers. This set of numbers has various characteristics, such as
arithmetic mean and standard deviation. A characteristic of this set of numbers is called a
parameter. For example, assume that the population consists of five spheres and that they
have the following diameters: 10, 13, 14, 19, and 21 cm. The diameters have an arith-
metic mean of 15.4 cm and standard deviation of 4.03 cm, and these values are parame-
ters of the given population.
Now consider that a subset of these objects is drawn. This subset is called a sample,
and a characteristic of the sample is called a statistic. Thus, using the previous illustration,
assume that the sample consists of the spheres having diameters of 14, 19, and 21 cm.
These diameters have an arithmetic mean of 18 cm and standard deviation of 2.94 cm,
and these values are statistics of the sample drawn. The number of objects in the sample is
the sample size.

FIGURE 22. Negative-exponential probability distribution.

In many instances, it is impossible to evaluate a parameter precisely, for two reasons:
The population may be so large as to preclude measurement of every object, and meas-
urement may entail destruction of the object, as in finding the breaking strength of a ca-
ble. In these cases it is necessary to estimate the parameter by drawing a representative
sample and evaluating the corresponding statistic. The process of estimating a parameter
by means of a statistic is known as statistical inference.
Since a statistic is a function of the manner in which the sample is drawn and thus is
influenced by chance, the statistic is a random variable. The probability distribution of a
statistic is called the sampling distribution of that statistic. Consider that all possible sam-
ples of a given size have been drawn and the statistic S corresponding to each sample has
been calculated. A characteristic of this set of values of S, such as the arithmetic mean, is
referred to as a characteristic of the sampling distribution of S. In the subsequent material,
the term mean refers exclusively to the arithmetic mean.

Notational System

Table 26 is presented for ease of reference. Here N = number of objects in the population;
IJL and a = arithmetic mean and standard deviation, respectively, of the population; n =
number of objects in the sample; X and s = arithmetic mean and standard deviation, re-
spectively, of the sample; fjis and <rs = arithmetic mean and standard deviation, respec-
tively, of the sampling distribution of the statistic S.

The quantity JJL^ is an index of the diversity of the sample means. As the sample size in-
creases, the samples become less diverse.
Since a sample represents a combination of TV objects taken w at a time, the number of
samples that may be drawn is CN>n = N\/[n\(N- «)!].

SAMPLING DISTRIBUTION OF THE MEAN

The population consists of 5 objects having the numerical values 15, 18, 27, 36, and 54;
the sample size is 3. Find the mean and standard deviation of the sampling distribution of
the mean.

Calculation Procedure:

1. Compute the mean and variance of the population

Mean IUL = (15 + 18 + 27 + 36 + 54)/5 = 30; variance o2 = [(15 - 3O)2 + (18 - 3O)2 + (27 -
3O)2 + (36 - 3O)2 + (54 - 30)2]/5 = 198.

2. Compute the properties of the sampling distribution

Apply Eq. 14 to find the mean of the sampling distribution of the mean, or /^ = 30. Ap-
ply Eq. 15 to find the variance of the sampling distribution, or crj = 198(5 - 3)/(3 x 4) =
33. Then cry V33 = 5.74.

3. Compute the required properties without recourse to any
set equations

If the population is finite, the number of possible samples is finite. Since all samples have
an equal likelihood of becoming the true sample, the sampling distribution of a statistic
can be found by forming all possible samples and computing the statistic under consider-
ation for each.
Record all possible samples in the first column of Table 27; the number of these sam-
ples is C5 3 = 10. Now compute the mean X of each sample, record the results in the sec-

ESTIMATION OF POPULATION MEAN
ON BASIS OF SAMPLE MEAN

A firm produces rods, and their lengths vary slightly because of unavoidable differences
in manufacture. Assume that the lengths are normally distributed. One hundred rods were
selected at random, and they were found to have a mean length of 1.856 m and a standard
deviation of 0.074 m. Estimate the mean length of all rods manufactured by this firm, us-
ing a 95 percent confidence level.

Calculation Procedure:

1. Compute the z value corresponding to the given
confidence level

9

Let X= length of a rod. The population consists of all rods manufactured by the firm, and
it may be considered infinite. There are two types of estimates: a point estimate, which as-
signs a specific value to X
 and an interval estimate, which states that X lies within a given
interval. This interval is called a confidence interval, its boundaries are called the confi-
dence limits, and the probability that the estimate is correct is called the confidence level,
or confidence coefficient. Statistical inference can supply only interval estimates.
The central-limit theorem states: (a) If the population is extremely large and the prob-
ability distribution of X is normal, then the sampling distribution of the sample mean X is
also normal; (b) if the population is extremely large but the probability distribution of X is
not normal, the sampling distribution of X is approximately normal if the sample size is
30 or more. Thus, in the present case, the sampling distribution of X is considered to be
normal. 
_
Figure 23 is the sampling distribution diagram of the sample mean X. Let M= area un-
der curve from B to^ C. If a sample is drawn at random, there is a probability M that the
true sample mean Xj lies within the interval BC, or P(JJLX ~ 2Px <^j< №x + zi°"jr) = M.
This equation can be transformed to P(Xj - z

 Eq. a.
In the present case, Xj = 1.856 m, s = 0.074 m, n = 100, and M= 0.95. Then area under
curve from A to C= (0.50)(0.95) = 0.475. From the table of areas under the normal curve,
if A(Z

 =1.96.

becomes P(1.841 < /x < 1.871) = 0.95. Thus, there is a 95 percent probability that the
mean length of all rods lies between 1.841 and 1.871 m.
Related Calculations: Note that the confidence interval is a function of the de-
gree of probability that is demanded, and the two quantities vary in the same direction.
For example, if the confidence level were 90 percent, the confidence interval would be
1.844 to 1.868m.

DECISION MAKING ON STATISTICAL BASIS

Units of a commodity are produced individually, and studies have shown that the time re-
quired to produce a unit has a mean value of 3.50 h and a standard deviation of 0.64 h. An
industrial engineer claims that a modification of the production process will substantially
reduce production time. The proposed method was tested on 40 units, and it was found
that the mean production time was 3.37 h per unit. Management has decided that it will
make the proposed modification only if there is a probability of 95 percent or more that
the engineer's claim is valid. What is your recommendation?

Calculation Procedure:

1. Formulate the null and alternative hypotheses

The population consists of all units that will be produced under the modified method if it
is adopted, and the sample consists of the 40 units actually produced under this method.
An assumption based on conjecture is termed a hypothesis. A hypothesis that is formulat-
ed merely to provide a basis for investigation is a null hypothesis, and any hypothesis that
contradicts the null hypothesis is an alternative hypothesis. However, interest centers on
the particular alternative hypothesis that is significant in the given case. The null and al-
ternative hypotheses are denoted by Tf0 and HI , respectively.
Let X= time required to produce 1 unit, h. Place the burden of proof on the industrial
engineer by assuming that production time under the modified method is identical with

that under the present method. Thus, the hypotheses are //0: JJL = 3.50 h and a = 0.64 h;
H1IfJL < 3 . 5 0 h.

2. Compute the properties of the sampling distribution
of the mean as based on the null hypothesis

Apply Eqs. 14 and 15«, giving JJL^ = 3.50 h and a^ = 0.64/40 = 0.101 h.

3. Compute the critical value of X

By the central-limit theorem given in the preceding calculation procedure, the sampling
distribution of the sample mean X may be considered normal, and the sampling distribu-
tion diagram is shown in Fig. 24a. Management has imposed a requirement of 95 percent
probability. Therefore, the null hypothesis is disproved and the alternative hypothesis val-
idated if the true sample mean has a value less than that corresponding to 95 percent of all
possible samples. In Fig. 24«, locate B such that the area to the right of B = 0.95; then area
from A to B = 0.95 - 0.50 = 0.45. The null hypothesis is to be accepted or rejected accord-
ing to whether the true value of X lies to the right or left of B, respectively, and the re-

gions are labeled as shown. The values of X and z at the boundary of the acceptance and
rejection regions are called the critical values.
At B, A(z) = 0.45. From the table of areas under the normal curve, z — -1.645. Thus, at
B, X = 3.50 + (-1.645)(0.101) = 3.334 h.

4. Make a recommendation

Since the true sample mean of 3.37 h falls to the right of B, the null hypothesis stands.
Therefore, we must recommend that the modified method of production be disapproved
and the present method retained.
This recommendation does not necessarily imply that the industrial engineer's claim is
invalid. The decision must be based on probability rather than certainty, and the test re-
sults have failed to demonstrate a 95 percent probability that the modified method is supe-
rior to the present method. The difference between the assumed population mean of 3.50
h and the sample mean of 3.37 h can be ascribed to chance.
Related Calculations'. If the null hypothesis is rejected when, in fact, it is true, a
Type I error has been committed. The probability of committing this error is denoted by
a, and the acceptable value of a is termed the level of significance. In this case, if the null
hypothesis is correct, the sampling distribution of X is as shown in Fig. 24a. The hypoth-
esis will be rejected if X assumes a value to the left of B, and the probability of this event
is 1 - 0.95 = 0.05. Thus, the level of significance is 0.05.
Whether a null hypothesis is accepted or rejected depends largely on the level of sig-
nificance imposed. Therefore, selecting an appropriate level of significance is one of the
crucial problems that arise in statistical decision making. The selection must be based on
the amount of the loss that would result from a false decision.

PROBABILITY OFACCEPTING A FALSE
NULL HYPOTHESIS

With reference to the preceding calculation procedure, the time required to produce 1 unit
under the modified method has these characteristics: The standard deviation remains 0.64
h, but the arithmetic mean is (a) 3.40 h; (b) 3.20 h. Determine the probability that the in-
dustrial engineer's proposal will be vetoed despite its merit.

Calculation Procedure:

1. Compute the critical value of z in each case

Since cr remains 0.64 h and the sample size is still 40, CT^ remains 0.101 h. Refer to Fig.
24b and c, which gives the sampling distributions of X when LL = 3.40 h and LL = 3.20 h,
respectively. The null hypothesis will be accepted if X > 3.334, and it is necessary to cal-
culate the probability of this event.
In Fig. 246, at B', z = (3.334 - 3.40)70.101 = -0.653. In Fig. 24c, at B", z = (3.334 -
3.20)70101-1.327.

2. Compute the required probabilities

Refer to the table of areas under the normal curve. When z = -0.653, A(z) = 0.243. In Fig.
246, area to right of B' = 0.243 + 0.5 = 0.743. Thus, when LL = 3.40 h, there is a probabil-
ity of 74.3 percent that the proposal will be vetoed. Similarly, when z = 1.327, A(z) =
0.408. In Fig. 24c, area to right of B" = 0.5 - 0.408 = 0.092. Thus, when LL = 3.20 h, there
is a probability of 9.2 percent that the proposal will be vetoed.

Related Calculations: If the null hypothesis is accepted when, in fact, it is false,
a Type II error has been committed, and the probability of committing this error is denot-
ed by /3. Thus, this calculation procedure involves the determination of'/3. It follows that 1
- /3 is the probability that a false null hypothesis will be rejected. The process of drawing
and analyzing a sample represents a test of the null hypothesis, and the quantities ft and 1
- ft are called the operating characteristic and power, respectively, of the test. Thus, the
power of a test is its ability to detect that the null hypothesis is false if such is truly the
case.
Consider that a diagram is constructed in which assumed values of the parameter are
plotted on the horizontal axis and the corresponding values of ft resulting from the null
hypothesis are plotted on the vertical axis. The curve thus obtained is called an operating-
characteristic curve. Similarly, the curve obtained by plotting values of 1 - ft against as-
sumed values of the parameter is called a power curve.

DECISION BASED ON PROPORTION
OFSAMPLE

A firm receives a large shipment of small machine parts, and it must determine whether
the number of defectives in a shipment is tolerable. Its policy is as follows: A shipment is
accepted only if the estimated incidence of defectives is 3 percent or less, the decision is
based on an inspection of 250 parts selected at random, and a shipment is rejected only if
there is a probability of 90 percent or more that the incidence of defectives exceeds 3 per-
cent. What is the highest incidence of defectives in the sample if the shipment is to be
considered acceptable?

Calculation Procedure:

1. Formulate the null hypothesis

Consider that a set of objects consists of type A and type B objects. The ratio of the num-
ber of type A objects to the total number of objects is called the proportion of type A ob-
jects. Let P and p = proportion of type A objects in the population and sample, respective-
ly.

In this case, the population consists of all machine parts in the shipment, the sample
consists of the 250 parts that are inspected, and interest centers on the proportion of de-
fective parts. To provide a basis for investigation, assume that the proportion of defec-
tives in the shipment is precisely 3 percent. Thus, the null hypothesis is H0: P = 0.03.

2. Compute the properties of the sampling distribution of the
proportion as based on the null hypothesis

Consider that all possible samples of a given size are drawn and their respective values of
p determined, thus obtaining the sampling distribution of p. As before, let N and n = num-
ber of objects in the population and sample, respectively. The sampling distribution of p
has these values: the mean fip = P, Eq. a; the variance (Tp=P(I- P)(N- n)/[n(N- I)], Eq.
b. Where the population is infinite, (Tp=P(I -P)/«, Eq. c. In the present case, P = 0.03, N
may be considered infinite, and n = 250. By Eq. a, 
/JLP = 0.03; by Eq. c, a* =
(0.03)(0.97)/250 - 0.0001164. Then standard deviation o-p = 0.0108.

3. Compute the critical value of p

For simplicity, treat the number of defective parts as a continuous rather than a discrete

variable; then P and p are also continuous. Since the sample is very large, the sampling
distribution ofp is approximately normal, and it is shown in Fig. 25a. The null hypothesis
is to be rejected if.p assumes a value greater than that corresponding to 90 percent of all
possible samples. In Fig. 25<z, locate B such that area to the left of B = 0.90; then area
from A to B = 0.90 - 0.50 = 0.40. At B9 A(z) = 0.40. From the table of areas under the nor-
mal curve, z = 1,282. Thus, at B9 p = 0.03 + (1.282)(0.0108) = 0.044.

4. State the decision rule

If the proportion of defectives in the sample is 4.4 percent or less, accept the shipment; if
the proportion is greater, reject the shipment.
By setting the limiting proportion of defectives in the sample at 4.4 percent as com-
pared with the limiting proportion of 3 percent in the population, allowance is being made
for the random variability of sample results.

PROBABILITY OF ACCEPTING AN
UNSATISFACTORY SHIPMENT

With reference to the preceding calculation procedure, what is the probability that a ship-
ment in which the incidence of defectives is 5 percent will nevertheless be accepted?

Accep tance region

Re jec t ion region

FIGURE 25. Sampling distribution of proportion of defective units.

Calculation Procedure:

1. Compute the true properties of the sampling distribution
of the proportion

Apply Eqs. a and c of the previous calculation procedure, giving fip9 = 0.05 and CT^ =
(0.05)(0.95)/250 = 0.0001900. Then orp = 0.0138. The sampling distribution diagram ap-
pears in Fig. 256.

2. Compute the probability that the shipment will be accepted

The shipment will be accepted if/? < 0.044, and it is necessary to calculate the probability
of this event. In Fig. 256, at B', z = (0.044 - 0.05)70.0138 = -0.435. From the table of ar-
eas under the normal curve, A(Z) = 0.168. Then the area to the left of B' = 0.5 - 0.168 =
0.332. Thus, there is a probability of 33.2 percent that the shipment will be accepted.

Reliability

Consider that a device operates continuously and fails abruptly. The life span of the de-
vice is a continuous random variable. The reliability of the device corresponding to a giv-
en length of time t, denoted by R(t), is the probability that its life span will exceed t. Let
T= life span. Then R(t) = P(T > t).
Refer to Fig. 26, which is the assumed life-span curve of a device. The diagram is con-
structed so that P(J1 < T ^ t2) = area under curve from tl to t2. Thus, a life-span curve is
the probability curve of the continuous variable T. Left/(f) = ordinate of life-span curve =
probability-density function. From the definition of reliability, it follows that R(t) = area
under curve to right of t, or

components, C1 and C2, and let the subscripts 1, 2, and S refer to C1, C2, and the sys-
tem, respectively. If the components are arranged in series, as shown in Fig. 27, the sys-
tem is operating only if both components are operating. Thus, the reliability of the sys-
tem is

Rs(t) = Rl(t)R2(t) 

(17)

If the components are arranged in parallel, as shown in Fig. 28, the system is operating if
either component is operating. To express it another way, the system fails if both compo-
nents fail, and

I - Rs( f) = [l-*i(0][l -*2(0]

or

Rs(f)=\-[\-Rl(tW-R2(f)] 

(18)

Equations 17 and 18 can be generalized to include any number of components. A system
having components in series has a reliability less than that of any component; a system
having components in parallel has a reliability greater than that of any component.

DEVICE WITH NEGATIVE-EXPONENTIAL
LIFE SPAN

A certain type of earth satellite has a negative-exponential life span with a mean value of
15 months. Four satellites of this type are launched simultaneously. If X denotes the num-
ber of satellites that remain in orbit at the expiration of 1 year, establish the probability
distribution of X.

FIGURE 28. System with components in parallel.

Calculation Procedure:

1. Compute the probability that a particular satellite will survive
the first year

Refer to the earlier calculation procedure pertaining to the negative-exponential probabil-
ity distribution. A device has a negative-exponential life span if its life-span curve has an
equation of this form:/(O = ae~at, Eq. a, where a = positive constant and e - base of natu-
ral logarithms. From Eq. 16a, R(t) = e~at, Eq. b. Figure 29 presents the life-span and relia-
bility diagrams. The mean life span JJL = I/a, Eq. c.
Take 1 month as the unit of time. In this case, JJL = 15; then a = 1/15. By Eq. b, R(t) =
e~t/l5, or /£(12) = eu/l5 = er°* = l/e°-s = 0.4493. Thus, there is a probability of 0.4493 that
a particular satellite will survive the first year.

2. Establish the probability distribution of X

Refer to the earlier calculation procedure pertaining to the binomial probability distribu-
tion. Launching a satellite may be viewed as a trial to determine whether the satellite will
survive the first year. Since all satellites operate independently, the trials are independent
of one another, and therefore X has a binomial probability distribution.
Apply the equation in step 2 of the procedure for the binomial distribution, with n = 4,
P = 0.4493, and 1 -P = 0.5507. Now, C40 = C44 = 1; C41 = C43 = 4; C4 2- 6. T h e nP (O)
= 1(0.5507)4 = 0.092; P(I) = 4(0.4493)(6.5507)3 = 0.300; P(2) = 6(0.4493)2(0.5507)2 =
0.367; P(3) = 4(0.4493)3(0.5507) - 0.200; P(4) = !(0.4493)4 = 0.041. These probabilities
total 1, as they must.
Related Calculations: It can readily be shown that a device that has a negative-
exponential life span and has been operating for some time has the same probability of
surviving the next unit of time as one that was just activated. Thus, the age of the device is
completely irrelevant in predicting its remaining life. Thus failure is caused not by cumu-
lative damage resulting from use but by a sudden accidental occurrence, and the probabil-
ity of this occurrence during the next unit of time is independent of the age of the device.
To apply an analogy, the probability that an individual who travels extensively by plane
will become the victim of a plane crash during the next year has no relation to the amount
of air travel that person has done in the past.

CORRESPONDENCE BETWEEN POISSON
FAILURE AND NEGATIVE-EXPONENTIAL
LIFE SPAN

The failure of a certain type of device has a Poisson probability, and the mean number of
failures in 1500 h of operation is 6. What is the reliability of the device for 270 h of oper-
ation?

Calculation Procedure:

1. Compute the mean life span

Refer to the previous calculation procedure pertaining to the Poisson probability distri-
bution. Consider the following: A device is set in operation. When this device fails, a
device of identical type is set in operation, and this replacement process continues in-
definitely. Let X denote the number of failures in time t, and assume that X has a Pois-
son probability distribution. Thus the probability that exactly 1 failure will occur in 1 h
remains constant as time elapses. It can readily be shown that the life span of the de-
vice, which is the time interval between successive failures, has a negative-exponential
probability distribution.
Select 1 h as the unit of time. Then mean life span IJL = 1500/6 = 250 h.

2. Compute the reliability

Apply Eq. c of the preceding calculation procedure, giving a = I/JJL= 1/250. Now apply
Eq. b, giving /2(270) = <r270/250 = e~im = 0.340.

PROBABILITY OF FAILURE DURING
A SPECIFIC PERIOD

The life span of a device is negative-exponential, and its mean value is 8 days. What is the
probability that the device will fail on the fifth day?

Calculation Procedure:

1. Set up the probability equation

Set T = life span, and refer to Fig. 26. As previously stated, P(t{ < T < t2) = area under
curve from J1 to J2. It follows that P(Y1 < T < J2) = RQ1) - R(t2). Take 1 day as the unit of
time. So P(4 < T < 5) - R(4) - R(5).

2. Compute the probability

Set a =11 IJi= 1/8. Then R(t) = e~at = e~t/s, or R(4) - e^* = 0.607 and R(5) - e~5/* = 0.535.
Thus, P(4 < T < 5) = 0.607 - 0.535 - 0.072.

Related Calculations'. Assume that the device has been operating for some
time. In accordance with the statement previously made, the probability that this device
will fail on the fifth day from the present is 0.072, regardless of the present age of the
device.

SYSTEM WITH COMPONENTS IN SERIES

A system consists of three type A components and two type B components, all arranged
in series. These components have negative-exponential life spans, and the mean life span
is 30 h for type A and 36 h for type B. Find the reliability of the system for 9 h of opera-
tion.

Calculation Procedure:

1. Compute the reliability of each component for 9 h

Let the subscripts A and B refer to the type of component, and take 1 h as the unit of time.
Then aA = I/HA = 1/30, and RA(f) = e't/30
9 or RA(9) = e'9/30 = 0.7408. Similarly, RB(9) =
e-9/36 = 0.7788.

2. Compute the reliability of the system for 9 h

Apply Eq. 17: Rs(9) = (0.7408)3(0.7788)2 = 0.247.

3. Compute the reliability of the system
by an alternative method

Apply Eq. 17 to prove that the system also has a negative-exponential life span. Now as-
sume that when a component fails, it is instantly replaced with one of identical type, thus
maintaining continuous operation. In 18Oh of operation, the mean number of failures of
an individual component is 180/30 = 6 for type A and 180/36 = 5 for type B. Since failure
of any component causes failure of the system, the mean number of failures of the system
in 180 h is 3 x 6 + 2 x 5 = 28. Thus, the mean life span of the system is JJLS = 180/28, and
as = 28/180. Then ast = (28/180)9 = 1.4, and R£9) = e~lA = 0.247.
In the foregoing calculations, 1 8 Oh was selected for convenience, since 180 is the
lowest common multiple of 30 and 36. However, a period of any length whatever can be
selected.

SYSTEM WITH COMPONENTS IN PARALLEL

With reference to the system in Fig. 30, the reliability of each component for a 60-day pe-
riod is as indicated. For example, the reliability of C1 is 0.18. Determine the probability

FIGURE 30

that the system will be operating at the expiration of 60 days as a result of each of the fol-
lowing causes: (a) only one component survives; (b) only two components survive; (c) all
three components survive.

Calculation Procedure:

1. Compute the probability that a component fails during
the 60-day period

The probability of failure is: for C1, 1 - 0.18 = 0.82; for C2, 1 - 0.23 = 0.77; for C3, 1 -
0.15 = 0.85.

2. Compute the probability that the system survives because
one and only one component survives

Multiply the probabilities of the individual events. Thus, P(only C1 survives) =
(0.18)(0.77)(0.85) - 0.11781; P(only C2 survives) = (0.82)(0.23)(0.85) = 0.16031; P(omy
C3 survives) = (0.82)(0.77)(0.15) = 0.09471. Sum the results: 0.11781 + 0.16031 +
0.09471 = 0.37283. This is the probability that only one component survives.

3. Compute the probability that the system survives because two
and only two components survive

Proceed as in step 2. Thus, P(on\y C1 and C2 survive) = (0.18)(0.23)(0.85) = 0.03519;
P(only C1 and C3 survive) = (0.18)(0.77)(0.15) = 0.02079; P(only C2 and C3 survive) =
(0.82)(0.23)(0.15) - 0.02829. Sum the results: 0.03519 + 0.02079 + 0.02829 = 0.08427 =
the probability that only two components survive.

4. Compute the probability that the system survives because all
three components survive

P(all survive) = (0.18)(0.23)(0.15) = 0.00621.

5. Verify the foregoing results

Sum the results in steps 2, 3, and 4: Rs(60) = 0.37283 + 0.08427 + 0.00621 = 0.46331.
Now apply Eq. 18, giving tfs(60) = 1 - (0.82)(0.77)(0.85) - 0.46331. The equality of the
two values confirms the results obtained in the previous steps.

SYSTEM WITH IDENTICAL COMPONENTS
IN PARALLEL

A certain type of component has a reliability of 0.12 for 20 days. How many such compo-
nents must be connected in parallel if the reliability of the system is to be at least 0.49 for
20 days?

Calculation Procedure:

1. Write the equation for the reliability of the system

Let n = number of components required. Apply Eq. 18, giving ^(2O) = 1 — (1 — 0.12)" =
1 - (0.88)", Eq. a.

2. Determine the number of components

Set RS(2Q) = 0.49 and solve Eq. a for /i, giving n = (log 0.51)/(log 0.88) = 5.3. Use six
components.

ANALYSIS OF COMPOSITE SYSTEM
BY CONVENTIONAL METHOD

A system is constructed by arranging the components in the manner shown in Fig. 3 Ia,
and the reliability of each component for a given time t is recorded in the drawing. For ex-
ample, the reliability O fC1 is 0.58. Find the reliability of the system for time t.

Calculation Procedure:

1. Perform the first cycle in transforming the system
to a simpler one

A system in which the components are arranged solely in series or in parallel is a simple

(a) Given system

(b) First equivalent system

(c ) Final equivalent system

FIGURE 31

system, and one that combines series and parallel arrangements is a composite system. A
composite system may be regarded as composed of subsystems, with a subsystem being a
set of components arranged solely in series or parallel formation. A subsystem can be re-
placed with its resultant, which is a single component that has a reliability equal to that of
the subsystem. Therefore, the conventional method of analyzing a composite system con-
sists of resolving the system into sub-systems and replacing the subsystems with their re-
sultants, continuing the process until the given system has been transformed to an equiva-
lent simple system.
Let D1 and D2 denote the resultants of C3 and C4 and of C5 and C6, respectively. Apply
Eq. 18 to obtain these reliabilities: for D1, 1 - (0.85)(0.83) = 0.29450; for Z)2, 1 -
(0.79)(0.70) = 0.44700. Replace these components with their resultants, producing the
equivalent composite system shown in Fig. 3 IZ?.

2. Perform the second cycle

Let D3 denote the resultant of C1, C2 and D1. Apply Eq. 17: reliability of D3 =
(0.58)(0.49)(0.29450) = 0.08370. Replace these components with D3, producing the
equivalent simple system shown in Fig. 3 Ic.

3. Compute the reliability of the system

Apply Eq. 18. The reliability of the system in Fig. 31c is Rs(t) = 1 - (0.91630)(0.55300) =
0.49329. This is also the reliability of the original system.

ANALYSIS OF COMPOSITE SYSTEM
BYALTERNATIVE METHOD

With reference to the preceding calculation procedure, find the reliability of the system by
the moving-particle method.

Calculation Procedure:

1. Compute the number of particles that traverse the system
by way of C1, C2, and either C3 or C4

The alternative method of analyzing a composite system is based on this conception: Dur-
ing a given interval, a certain number of particles enter the system at one terminal and
seek to move through the system to the other terminal. Each component offers resistance
to the movement of these particles, and the proportion of particles that penetrate a compo-
nent is equal to the reliability of that component. If a particle is obstructed at any point
along its path, it returns to an earlier point and then proceeds along an alternative path if
one is available. However, a particle can enter a component in a given direction only
once. The reliability of the system is equal to the proportion of particles that traverse the
system.
Consider that during a given interval 1,000,000 particles arrive at point a in Fig. 3 Ia,
seeking a path to d. They can reach d by passing through C1, C2, and either C3 or C4, or by
passing through C5 or C6. Assume that the particles attempt passage by the first route, and
refer to the schematic drawing in Fig. 32. The number of particles that penetrate C1 =
1,000,000(0.58) = 580,000, and the number that then penetrate C2 = 580,000(0.49) =
284,200. Assume that these particles now enter C3. The number of particles that penetrate
C3 = 284,200(0.15) = 42,630. The number that fail to penetrate C3 = 284,200 - 42,630 =
241,570; these particles return to b in Fig. 3 Ia and enter C4. The number that penetrate

C4 = 241,570(0.17) = 41,067. Thus, the number of particles that reach d by way OfC1, C2,
and either C3 or C4 = 42,630 + 41,067 - 83,697.
As an alternative calculation, the number of particles that fail to penetrate C3 =
284,200(0.85)-241,570.
Note that the proportion of particles that traverse the system by the indicated route is
83,697/1,000,000 = 0.08370 (to five decimal places), and this is the reliability O fD3 in
Fig. 3Ic.

2. Compute the number of particles that traverse the system
by way of either C5 or C6

Refer to Fig. 32. The number of particles that fail to penetrate a component is: for C1,
1,000,000 - 580,000 = 420,000; for C2, 580,000 - 284,200 = 295,800; for C4, 241,570 -
41,067 - 200,503. The total is 420,000 + 295,800 + 200,503 = 916,303. These particles
return to a in Fig. 3 Ia and then proceed to c. Assume that they now enter C5. The number
of particles that penetrate C5 = 916,303(0.21) = 192,424, and the number that fail to pene-
trate C5 = 916,303 - 192,424 - 723,879. The latter enter C6, and the number that penetrate
C6 = 723,879(0.30) = 217,164. Thus, the number of particles that reach dby way of either
C5 or C6 - 192,424 + 217,164 = 409,588.
Note that the proportion of particles that traverse this route is 409,588/916,303 =
0.44700, and this is the reliability of D2 in Fig. 3 Ic.

3. Compute the reliability of the system

From steps 1 and 2 (or from Fig. 32), the number of particles that traverse the system
from a to d = 83,697 + 409,588 = 493,285. The proportion of particles that traverse the
system = 493,285/1,000,000 = 0.49329, and this is the reliability of the system. This re-
sult is consistent with that in the preceding calculation procedure.
Alternatively, find the number of particles that traverse the system thus: A particle

FIGURE 32

fails to traverse the system if it fails to penetrate C6. From Fig. 32, the number of such
particles is 723,879 - 217,164 = 506,715. Thus, the number of particles that traverse the
system - 1,000,000 - 506,715 = 493,285.
Related Calculations: The moving-particle method discloses certain principles
very clearly. For example, assume that a simple composite system has components in se-
ries. To traverse the system, a particle must penetrate all components, and therefore the
resistance of each component contributes to the resistance of the system. Thus, the resist-
ance of the system exceeds that of any component, and the reliability of the system is less
than that of any component. Now assume that a simple composite system has components
in parallel. These components offer alternative paths for the moving particles, and there-
fore the reliability of the system exceeds that of any component.

ANALYSIS OF SYSTEM WITH SAFEGUARD
BY CONVENTIONAL METHOD

A system is constructed by arranging the components in the manner shown in Fig. 33, and
the reliability of each component for a given time t is recorded in the drawing. Find the
reliability of the system for time t.

Calculation Procedure:

1. Identify the types of failure

The system operates if any of the following pairs of components operate: C1, and C4; C2
and C4; C2 and C5; C3 and C5. Thus, if C1 and C3 both fail, the system continues to oper-
ate through C2, and therefore C2 is a safeguard. The reliability of the system can be found
most simply by determining the probability that the system will fail.
There are several modes of potential failure, but they can all be encompassed within
two broad types. A type 1 failure occurs if each of the following events occurs: (a) C2
fails; (b) either C1 or C4 fails, or both fail; (c) either C3 or C5 fails, or both fail. A type 2
failure occurs if each of the following events occurs: (a) C5 operates; (b) C4 fails; (c) C5
fails.

FIGURE 33

2. Compute the probability of a type 1 failure

To simplify the notation, let R = reliability of a component, with a subscript identical with
that of the component, and Rs = reliability of the system.
As previously stated, if two events are independent of each other, the probability that
both will occur is the product of their respective probabilities. Consider a type 1 failure.
The probability that C2 fails is 1 - R2. The probability that both C1, and C4 operate is R1,
R4 thus, the probability that either or both components fail is 1 - RI, R4. Similarly, the
probability that C3 or C5 fails or both fail is 1 - -R3-K5. Thus, the probability of a type 1
failure is P(type 1) = (1 - ,R2)(I - ,M4)(I - R3R5), or P(type 1) = (0.47)[1 - (0.62)
(0.39)][1 - (0.41)(0.55)] = 0.27600.

3. Compute the probability of a type 2 failure

Multiply the probabilities of the three specified events, giving P(type 2) = ^2(I - R4)
x (1 -^3) or />(type 2) = (0.53)(0.61)(0.45) = 0.14549.

4. Compute the reliability of the system

The probability that either of two mutually exclusive events will occur is the sum of their
respective probabilities. From steps 2 and 3, the, probability that the system will fail is
0.27600 + 0.14549 = 0.42149. Then Rs= 1 - 0.42149 = 0.57851.

ANALYSIS OF SYSTEM WITH SAFEGUARD
BYALTERNATIVE METHOD

With reference to the preceding calculation procedure, find the reliability of the system by
the moving-particle method.

Calculation Procedure:

1. Compute the number of particles that traverse the system
by way of C2

Consider that during a given interval 1,000,000 particles arrive at point a in Fig. 33, seek-
ing a path to c. They can reach c by any of three routes: C2 and either C4 or C5; C1 and C4;
C3 and C5. Assume that the particles attempt passage by the first route, and refer to Fig.
34. The number of particles that penetrate C2 = 1,000,000(0.53) = 530,000. Assume that
these particles now enter C4. The number of particles that penetrate C4 = 530,000(0.39) =
206,700, and the number that fail to penetrate C4 = 530,000 - 206,700 = 323,300. The lat-
ter return to b in Fig. 33 and then enter C5. The number that penetrate C5 = 323,300(0.55)
= 177,815. Thus, the number of particles that reach c by way of C2 and either C4 or C5 =
206,700 +177,815 = 384,515.

2. Compute the number of particles that traverse the system
by way of C1 and C4

Refer to Fig. 34. The number of particles that fail to penetrate C2 = 1,000,000 - 530,000 =
470,000. These particles return to a in Fig. 33; assume that they then enter C1. The num-
ber of particles that penetrate C1 = 470,000(0.62) = 291,400, and the number that then
penetrate C4 = 291,400(0.39) = 113,646. Thus, 113,646 particles reach c by way of C1
and C4.

3. Compute the number of particles that traverse the system
by way of C3 and C5

From step 2, the number of particles that fail to penetrate C1 = 470,000 - 291,400 =

FIGURE 34

178,600, and the number that fail to penetrate C4 = 291,400 - 113,646 = 177,754. These
particles return to a in Fig. 33 and then enter C3. Refer to Fig. 34. The number of par-
ticles that penetrate C3 = (178,600 + 177,754)(0.41) = 146,105, and the number that
then penetrate C5 - 146,105(0.55) = 80,358. Thus, 80,358 particles reach c by way of
C3 and C5.

4. Compute the reliability of the system

From steps 1, 2, and 3 (or from Fig. 34), the number of particles that traverse the system
from a to c = 384,515 + 113,646 + 80,358 = 578,519. The proportion of particles that tra-
verse the system = 578,519/1,000,000 = 0.57852, and this is the reliability of the system.
This result is consistent with that in the preceding calculation procedure.

Making Business Decisions under Uncertainty

The industrial world is characterized by uncertainty, and so many business decisions
must be based on considerations of probability. The calculation procedures that follow
illustrate several techniques that have been developed for making decisions of this
type.

OPTIMAL INVENTORY TO MEET
FLUCTUATING DEMAND

A firm sells a commodity that is used only during the winter. Because the commodity de-
teriorates with age, units of the commodity that remain unsold by the end of the season
cannot be carried over to the following winter. To allow time for manufacture, the firm
must place its order for the commodity before July 1. Thus, the firm must decide how
many units to stock. For simplicity, the firm orders only in multiples of 10, and it assumes
that the number of units demanded by its customers is also a multiple of 10.
A study of past records reveals that the number of units demanded per season ranges
from 150 to 200, and the probabilities are as shown in Table 28. The cost of the commod-
ity, including purchase price and allowance for handling, storage, and insurance, is $50
per unit; the selling price is $75 per unit. Units that are not sold can be disposed of as
scrap for $6 each. If the firm is unable to satisfy the demand, it suffers a loss of goodwill
because there is some possibility of permanently losing customers to a competitor; this
loss of goodwill is assigned the value of $4 per unsold unit. How many units of this com-
modity should the firm order?

Calculation Procedure:

1. Set up the equations for profit

A firm that sells a perishable commodity with a widely fluctuating demand runs a risk at
each end of the spectrum. If its stock is excessive, it suffers a loss on the unsold units; if
its stock is inadequate, it forfeits potential profits and suffers a loss of goodwill. So it
must determine how large a stock to maintain to maximize profits in the long run, apply-
ing past demand as a guide.
Let X = number of units ordered; Y= number of units demanded; P = profit (exclusive
of fixed costs), $. IfX= 7, then P = (JS- 5O)X, or P = 25X, Eq. a. IfX > 7, then P = 757
- 5OJT+ 6(X- 7), or P = -44X+ 697, Eq. b. lfX< 7, then P = (75 - SQ)X-4(Y-X), or
P = 29X- 47, Eq. c.

2. Construct the profit matrix

In Table 29, list all possible values of X in the column at the left and all possible values of
7 in the row across the top. Compute the value of P for every possible combination of X
and 7, and record the value in the table. Thus, assume X= Y= 160; by Eq. a, P = 25 x 160
= $4000. Now assume^= 180 and Y= 160; by Eq. b, P = -44X180 + 69 x 160 = $3120.
Finally, assume X= 160 and Y= 200; by Eq. c, P = 29 x 160 - 4 x 200 - $3840. Table 29
shows that P can range from $1550 (when the stock is highest and the demand is lowest)
to $5000 (when the demand is highest and the stock is adequate for the demand).
Alternatively, find the values of P thus: In Table 29, insert all values lying on the

a. In each column, proceed upward from this diagonal by successively deducting $290, in
accordance with Eq. c. Then proceed downward from the diagonal by successively de-
ducting $440, in accordance with Eq. b.

3. Compute the expected prof it corresponding to each value of X

As stated earlier, if all possible values of a random variable are multiplied by their respec-
tive probabilities and the products are added, the result equals the arithmetic mean of the
variable in the long run, and it is also called the expected value of the variable. For con-
venience, repeat the probability corresponding to every possible value of Y at the bottom
of Table 29. Let E(P) = expected value of P. When X = 150, E(P) = $3750(0.08) +
$3710(0.13) + $3670(0.20) + $3630(0.32) + $3590(0.18) + $3550(0.09) = $3643.60.
When X= 160, E(P) = $3310(0.08) + $4000(0.13) + $3960(0.20) + $3920(0.32) +
$3880(0.18) + $3840(0.09) = $3875.20. Continue these calculations to obtain: when X=
170, E(P) = $4011.90; when X= 180, E(P) = $4002.60; when X= 190, E(P) = $3759.70;
when X= 200, E(P) = $3385.40.

4. Determine how many units the firm should order

The results in step 3 show that the expected profit is maximum when X= 170. Therefore,
the firm should order 170 units. If the fluctuation in dema'nd follows the same pattern as
in the past, the firm will maximize its profits in the long run by maintaining a stock of this
size.

FINDING OPTIMAL INVENTORYBY
INCREMENTAL-PROFIT METHOD

With reference to the preceding calculation procedure, determine how many units the
firm should order by applying incremental analysis.

Calculation Procedure:

1. Set up the equation for expected incremental profit

Consider that the firm increases the number of units ordered by 10. In doing this, the firm

has undertaken an incremental investment, and the profit that accrues from this incremen-
tal investment is called the incremental profit. Since the objective is to maximize profits
from the sale of this commodity without reference to the rate of return that the firm earns
on invested capital, the incremental investment is justified if the incremental profit has a
positive value.
If a demand for these 10 additional units exists, the firm earns a direct profit of 10($75
- $50) = $250, and it reduces its loss of goodwill by 10($4) = $40. Thus, the effective
profit = $250 + $40 = $290. If a demand for the 10 additional units does not exist, the firm
incurs a loss of 10($50 - $6) = $440. Let /"(sold) and P(not sold) = probability the 10 ad-
ditional units will be sold and will not be sold, respectively, and E(AP) = expected incre-
mental profit, $. Then E(AP) = 290 [P(sold)] - 440 [P(not sold)]. Set P(not sold) = 1 -
P(sold), giving E(AP) = 730 [P(sold)] - 440, Eq. a.

2. Apply this equation to find the optimal inventory

From the preceding calculation procedure, E(P) is positive if X= 150; thus, the firm
should order at least 150 units. Assume X increases from 150 to 160. From Table 28,
P(sold) = 1 - 0.08 = 0.92. By Eq. a, E(AP) = 730(0.92) - 440 = $231.60 > O, and the in-
cremental investment is justified. Assume X increases from 160 to 170. Then P(sold) = 1
- (0.08 + 0.13) = 0.79. By Eq. a, E(AP) = 730(0.79) - 440 = $136.70 > O, and the incre-
mental investment is justified. Assume X increases from 170 to 180. Then P(sold) = 1 -
(0.08 + 0.13 + 0.20) = 0.59. By Eq. a, E(AP) - 730(0.59) - 440 = -$9.30 < O, and the in-
cremental investment is not justified. Thus, the firm should order 170 units.

3. Devise a direct method of solution

Determine when E(AP) changes sign by setting E(AP) = 730 [P(sold)] - 440 = O, giving
P(sold) = 440/730 = 0.603. This is the lower limit of P(sold) if the incremental investment
is to be justified. Now, P(sold) first goes below this value when X= 180; thus, the expect-
ed profit is maximum when X = 170.
Related Calculations'. From the preceding calculation procedure, when X = 150,
E(P) = $3643.60; when X= 160, E(P) = $3875.20. Thus, when Xincreases from 150 to
160, E(AP) - $3875.20 - $3643.60 = $231.60, and this is the result obtained in step 2.
Similarly, from the preceding calculation procedure, when X increases from 160 to 170,
E(AP) = $4011.90 - $3875.20 = $136.70, and this is the result obtained above. The two
methods of solution yield consistent results.
The incremental-profit method is less time-consuming than the method followed in
the preceding calculation procedure, and it is particularly appropriate when the firm sets a
minimum acceptable rate of return. Thus, assume that the firm will undertake an invest-
ment only if the expected rate of return is 15 percent or more. When the firm orders 10
additional units, it undertakes an incremental investment of $440. This incremental in-
vestment is justified only if the expected incremental profit is at least $440(0.15), or $66.

SIMULATION OF COMMERCIAL ACTIVITY
BY THE MONTE CARLO TECHNIQUE

A firm sells and delivers a standard commodity. The terms of sale require that the firm
deliver the product within 1 day after an order is placed. In the past, the volume of orders
received averaged 3315 units per week, with the variation in volume shown in Table 30.
The firm currently employs a trucking company. But the firm contemplates purchas-
ing its own fleet of trucks to make deliveries. It is therefore necessary to decide how
many trucks are to be purchased. Several plans are under consideration. The shipping
facilities under plan A have an estimated average capacity of 3405 units per week.

Experience indicates that this capacity may be expected to vary in the manner shown in
Table 30.
When the volume of daily orders exceeds the shipping capacity, sales will be lost;
when the reverse condition occurs, trucks will be idle. Lost sales are valued at $2.40 per
unit, which includes an allowance for partial loss of goodwill. Unused shipping capacity
is valued at $1.10 per unit. Applying the Monte Carlo technique, estimate the amount of
these losses if plan A is adopted.

Calculation Procedure:

1. Determine the average weekly losses

In Table 30, record the median value for each range, as shown in the third and sixth
columns. For convenience, apply only these median values in the calculations. This pro-
cedure is equivalent to assuming, for example, that the volume of prospective sales varies
discretely from 3050 to 3550 units with an interval of 100 units between consecutive val-
ues.
Analysis of Table 30 reveals that the excess of weekly shipping capacity over delivery
requirements may range between 425 units (3475 - 3050) and -225 units (3325 - 3550),
and that it may assume any of the following values:

425 
175 
-75 

375 
125 
-125 

325 
75 
-175 

275 
25 
-225

225
-25

To evaluate the average weekly losses, it is necessary to evaluate the frequency with
which these values are likely to exist. The Monte Carlo technique is a probabilistic device
that circumvents the mathematical complexity inherent in a rigorous solution by resorting
to a set of numbers generated in a purely random manner. Tables of random numbers are
published in books listed in the references for this section.

2. Compute the cumulative frequency of the prospective sales

The cumulative frequency of each value of prospective sales is the relative frequency
with which orders of the designated magnitude, or less, are received. The results of this
calculation appear in Table 31.

3. Prepare a histogram of the frequency distributions

Plot the cumulative-frequency values in Fig. 35. Draw horizontal and vertical lines as
shown. The relative frequency of a given value of the prospective sales is represented by
the length of the vertical line directly above the value.

4. Select random numbers for the solution

Refer to a table of random numbers. Select the first 10 numbers found in the table. Enter
these numbers in the second column of Table 32. (In actual practice, a larger quantity of
random numbers would be selected.)

5. Use the random numbers in the solution

Consider each random number as a cumulative frequency. Refer to the histogram, Fig. 35,
to find the volume of orders corresponding to this value of the random number. Then,
draw a horizontal through the random-number value of 0.488 on the vertical axis of Fig.
35. This line intersects the vertical that lies above the value of 3250 on the horizontal axis.
Therefore, enter in Table 32 the value of 3250 opposite the random number 0.488.

6. Repeat steps 3 to 5 for the shipping capacity

Enter the results in Table 32 in the same manner as for the units demanded, step 5.

7. Evaluate the loss on sales and unused capacity

Compare the simulated prospective sales with the simulated capacity. For example, dur-
ing week 1, the loss on unused capacity = 1.10(3375 - 3250) = $137.50, given the data
from Table 32. Likewise, during week 4, loss on lost sales = 2.40(3350 - 3325) = $60.00.

8. Determine the average weekly losses

Total the computed losses obtained in step 7, and divide by 10 to obtain the following av-
erage weekly values:

Loss on unused capacity 
Loss on forfeited sales 
Total 

$68.75
90.00
$158.75

If more trucking facilities are procured, the forfeited sales will be reduced, but the un-
used capacity will be increased. The optimal number of trucks to be purchased is that for
which the total loss is a minimum.

LINEAR REGRESSION APPLIED TO
SALES FORECASTING

A firm had the following sales for 5 consecutive years:

Year 

19AA 
19BB 
19CC 
19DD 
19EE 

Sales, $000

348
377
418
475
500

In 19FF, the firm decided to expand its production facilities in anticipation of future
growth, and therefore it required a forecast of future sales. Apply linear regression to dis-
cern the sales trend. What is the projected sales volume for 19JJ?

Calculation Procedure:

1. Plot a scatter diagram for the given data

Regression analysis is applied where a causal relationship exists between two variables,
although the relationship is obscured by the influence of random factors. The problem is
to establish the relationship on the basis of observed data. Here we assume that the sales
volume is a linear function of time.
Consider the annual sales income to be a lump sum received at the end of the given
year, and plot the sales data as shown in Fig. 36. The aggregate of points is termed a scat-
ter diagram. This diagram will be replaced by a straight line that most closely approaches
the plotted points; this straight line is called the regression line, or line of best fit.

2. Set up the criterion for the regression line

Draw the arbitrary straight line in Fig. 36, and consider the vertical deviation e of a point
in the scatter diagram from this arbitrary line. The regression line is taken as the line for
which the sum of the squares of the deviations is minimum.
Let 7 denote the ordinate of a point in the scatter diagram and YR the corresponding or-
dinate on the regression line. By definition, Se2 = 2(7- YR)2 = minimum.

3. Write the equation of the regression line

Let n denote the number of points in the scatter diagram, and let YR = a + bXbe the equa-
tion of the regression line, where X denotes the year number as measured from some con-
venient datum. To find the regression line, parameters a and b must be evaluated.
Since Se2 is to have a minimum value, express the partial derivatives of 2e2 with re-
spect to a and b, and set these both equal to zero. Then derive the following simultaneous
equations containing the unknown quantities a and b:

2Y = an+bZX

^XY = aZX + b^X2

4. Simplify the calculations

Select the median date (the end of 19CC) as a datum. This selection causes the term ^X to
vanish.

5. Determine the values of SX2 and SXY

Prepare a tabulation such as Table 33. Use the data for each year in question.

6. Solve for parameters a and b

Substitute in the equations in step 3, and solve for a and b. Thus 2118 = 5a; 402 = 1OZ?;
a -423.6; b -40.2.

Here 7* - 423.6 + 40.2X. For 19JJ: X= 7; YR = 423.6 + 40.2 (7) - 705. Hence, the fore-
cast sales for 19JJ = $705,000. For comparative purposes, the past sales volumes as deter-
mined by the regression line are listed in Table 33.

STANDARD DEVIATION FROM
REGRESSION LINE

Using the data in the previous calculation procedure, appraise the reliability of the regres-
sion line in forecasting future sales by computing the standard deviation of the points in
the scatter diagram, using the regression line as the datum from which the deviation is
measured.

Calculation Procedure:

1. Calculate the deviation of each point; square the result

The standard deviation serves as an index of the dispersion of the points in the scatter dia-
gram. The standard deviation cr = V2e2/«.
Calculate the value of e for each point, Fig. 36. Enter the results for each year in a tab-
ulation such as Table 34. Then, a = V236.8/5 = 6.9.

SHORT-TERM FORECASTING
WITH A MARKOV PROCESS

The XYZ Company manufactures a machine that is available in three models, A, B, and
C. There are currently 1200 such machines in use, divided as follows: model A, 460;
model B, 400; model C, 340. On the basis of a survey, the XYZ Company has established
probabilities corresponding to two successive purchases, and they are recorded in Table
35. Thus, if a firm currently owns model B, there is a probability of 0.5000 that its next
model will be A; if a firm currently owns model C, there is a probability of 0.6154 that its
next model will also be C. Assume that each machine will remain in service for precisely
1 year, after which it will be replaced with another machine manufactured by the XYZ
Company. Also assume that the XYZ Company will not acquire any new customers in the
foreseeable future. Estimate the number of units of each model that will be in use 1 year,
2 years, and 3 years hence.

Calculation Procedure:

1. Set up the basic equations that link two successive years

Assume that a trial will be performed repeatedly and that the outcome of one trial directly
influences the outcome of the succeeding trial. A trial of this type is called a Markov
process. In this situation, the purchase of a machine is a Markov process because the
model that a firm selects on one occasion has a direct bearing on the model it selects on
the following occasion. The probabilities in Table 35 are termed transition probabilities,
and the table itself is called a transition matrix.
Let XA>n = expected number of units of model A that will be in use n years hence. Mul-
tiply the expected values for n years hence by their respective probabilities to obtain the
expected values for n + 1 years hence, giving

XA** = 0.4167JC01 + 0.5000XBilt + 0.1538XCn

XB>n+l = 0.3333AC01 + 0.30OQAT^ + 0.2308AT0, 

Xc>n+l = 0.2500A^n + 0.200OY^n + 0.6154AfCn 

2. Calculate the expected values for 1 year hence

Apply Eqs. a, b, and c with n = O and XAO = 460, X80 = 400, Xco = 340. Then XA

LONG-TERM FORECASTING
WITH A MARKOV PROCESS

With reference to the preceding calculation procedure, estimate the number of units of
each model that will ultimately be in use simultaneously.

Calculation Procedure:

1. Form a system of simultaneous equations containing the limits
of the expected values

In the long run, the probability that a firm will buy a given model is solely a function of
the specific needs of that firm and the characteristics of each model; it is independent of
the particular model that the firm happens to own at present. Therefore, XA „, XB „, and
XCn approach definite limits as n increases beyond bound. The values of these variables
when n has a finite value constitute transient conditions, and the values when n is infinite
constitute the steady-state conditions. In practice, however, the steady-state conditions
may be considered to exist when all differences between transient and steady-state values
become less than some specified small number.
Let XA n = Hm XA n. In Eqs. a and b of the preceding calculation procedure, replace the
transient values with their respective limits and rearrange:

-0.5833^M + 0.500(LY^ + 0.1538^ = O 

0.3333AT^M - 0.7000^u + 0.2308^Cw = O 

(ar)

(b')

Also,

^+^+^=1200 

(d)

2. Solve the system of equations

The results are XAu = 411; Jf5 M = 343; XCiU = 446. Thus, it is expected that there will ulti-
mately be 411 units of model A, 343 units of model B, and 446 units of model C in use si-
multaneously. Note that the values of XA>39 XE^ and A^3 in Table 36 are very close to the
limiting values. Thus, the expected values approach their respective limits rapidly.
Related Calculations: Many problems in engineering, economics, and other ar-
eas lend themselves to solution as Markov processes. The computational techniques ap-
plied in this calculation procedure and the preceding one are entirely general, and they
may be applied to any problem where a Markov process exists.

VERIFICATION OF STEADY-STATE
CONDITIONS FOR A MARKOV PROCESS

Verify the accuracy of the results obtained in the preceding calculation procedure by de-
vising an alternative method of solution.

Calculation Procedure:

1. Construct a recurring series of outcomes that conforms
with the given process

Assume that a Markov process has three possible outcomes, A, B, and C, and that the first
35 outcomes were these:

B-A-A-B-B-A-C-C-C-C-B-A-A-A-C-C-A-A-A-C-C-B-A-B-A-B-C-C-C-C-A-B-C-B-B

This series consists of 12 A's, 10 B's, and 13 Cs. Also assume that this series of out-
comes will recur indefinitely. Thus, the last outcome in the series will be followed by B.
It will be demonstrated that this series is relevant to the preceding calculation procedure.

2. Compute the transition probabilities as established
by the recurring series

Count the successors of the outcomes in this series, and then compute the relative fre-
quencies of the various successions. Refer to Table 37 for the calculations. Since the giv-
en series of outcomes will recur indefinitely, the relative frequencies in Table 37 equal the
transition probabilities corresponding to the present Markov process. Thus, the probabil-
ity that A will be followed by B is 0.3333, and the probability that C will be followed by
A is 0.1538. Since these transition probabilities coincide with those in Table 35, it follows
that the present recurring series provides a basis for investigating the Markov process in
the preceding calculation procedure.

3. Compute the steady-state probabilities

In the long run, the probability that a given outcome will occur is independent of some
outcome in the distant past. In the recurring series, the relative frequencies of the out-
comes are: outcome A, 12/35; outcome B, 10/35; outcome C, 13/35. These relative fre-
quencies are the steady-state probabilities corresponding to the Markov process.

4. Compute the expected number of units in use
at steady-state conditions

In the preceding calculation procedure, the total number of machines that will be in use si-
multaneously is 1200. Multiply the steady-state probabilities found in step 3 by 1200 to
obtain the expected number of units of each model that ultimately will be in use simulta-
neously. The results are: model A, 1200(12/35) = 411; model B, 1200(10/35) = 343; mod-
el C, 1200(13/35) = 446. These results coincide with those obtained in the preceding cal-
culation procedure, and so the latter are confirmed.
Related Calculations: In constructing the recurring series of outcomes, it is nec-
essary to apply the principle of succession. Assume that a Markov process has three pos-
sible outcomes, A, B, and C; and let Af(A-B) = number of times that A is followed by B.
The principle is W(A-B) + N(A-C) = N(B-A) + N(C-A). As an illustration, consider the
following skeletal series, where each outcome is followed by a different outcome:

A-C-A-C-B-A-B-A-C-B-A-C-B-C-A-C

The last outcome will be followed by A. Then AT(A-B) + N(A-C) = N(B-A) + N(C-A)
= 6; N(B-A) + TV(B-C) = TV(A-B) + N(C-B) = 4; N(C-A) + N(C-B) = N(A-C) + TV(B-C) =
6. Now this skeletal series can be expanded to the true series by allowing one outcome to
be followed by the same outcome. For example, assume the requirements are TV(A-A) = 3,
TV(B-B) = 5, and TV(C-C) = 6. A true recurring series is

A-A-C-C-C-C-A-C-C-C-B-B-B-A-B-B-A-C-C-B-B-B-A-A-C-B-C-A-A-C

PREFACE

This handbook presents a comprehensive collection of civil engineering calculation
procedures useful to practicing civil engineers, surveyors, structural designers, draft-
ers, candidates for professional engineering licenses, and students. Engineers in other
disciplines—mechanical, electrical, chemical, environmental, etc.—will also find this
handbook useful for making occasional calculations outside their normal field of
specialty.
Each calculation procedure presented in this handbook gives numbered steps for per-
forming the calculation, along with a numerical example illustrating the important con-
cepts in the procedure. Many procedures include "Related Calculations" comments which
expand the application of the computation method presented. All calculation procedures
in this handbook use both the USCS (United States Customary System) and the SI (Sys-
tem International) for numerical units. Hence, the calculation procedures presented are
useful to engineers throughout the world.
Major calculation procedures presented in this handbook include stress and strain,
flexural analysis, deflection of beams, statically indeterminate structures, steel beams and
columns, riveted and welded connections, composite members, plate girders, load and re-
sistance factor design method (LRFD) for structural steel design, plastic design of steel
structures, reinforced and prestressed concrete engineering and design, surveying, route
design, highway bridges, timber engineering, soil mechanics, fluid mechanics, pumps,
piping, water supply and water treatment, wastewater treatment and disposal, hydro pow-
er, and engineering economics.
Each section of this handbook is designed to furnish comprehensive coverage of the
topics in it. Where there are major subtopics within a section, the section is divided into
parts to permit in-depth coverage of each subtopic.
Civil engineers design buildings, bridges, highways, airports, water supply, sewage
treatment, and a variety of other key structures and facilities throughout the world. Be-
cause of the importance of such structures and facilities to the civilized world, civil engi-
neers have long needed a handbook which would simplify and speed their daily design
calculations. This handbook provides an answer to that need.
While there are computer programs that help the civil engineer with a variety of engi-
neering calculations, such programs are highly specialized and do not have the breadth of
coverage this handbook provides. Further, such computer programs are usually expen-
sive. Because of their high cost, these computer programs can be justified only when a
civil engineer makes a number of repetitive calculations on almost a daily basis. In con-
trast, this handbook can be used in the office, field, drafting room, or laboratory. It pro-
vides industry-wide coverage in a convenient and affordable package. As such, this hand-
book fills a long-existing need felt by civil engineers worldwide.
In contrast, civil engineers using civil-engineering computer programs often find data-
entry time requirements are excessive for quick one-off-type calculations. When one-off-
type calculations are needed, most civil engineers today turn to their electronic calculator,
desktop or laptop computer and perform the necessary steps to obtain the solution desired.
But where repetitive calculations are required, a purchased computer program will save
time and energy in the usual medium-size or large civil-engineering design office. Small
civil-engineering offices generally resort to manual calculation for even repetitive proce-

dures because the investment for one or more major calculation programs is difficult to
justify in economic terms.
Even when purchased computer programs are extensively used, careful civil engineers
still insist on manually checking results on a random basis to be certain the program is ac-
curate. This checking can be speeded by any of the calculation procedures given in this
handbook. Many civil engineers remark to the author that they feel safer, knowing they
have manually verified the computer results on a spot-check basis. With liability for civil-
engineering designs extending beyond the lifetime of the designer, every civil engineer
seeks the "security blanket" provided by manual verification of the results furnished by a
computer program run on a desktop, laptop, or workstation computer. This handbook
gives the tools needed for manual verification of some 2,000 civil-engineering calculation
procedures.
Each section in this handbook is written by one or more experienced professional en-
gineers who is a specialist in the field covered. The contributors draw on their wide expe-
rience in their field to give each calculation procedure an in-depth coverage of its topic.
So the person using the procedure gets step-by-step instructions for making the calcula-
tion plus background information on the subject which is the topic of the procedure.
And since the handbook is designed for worldwide use, both earlier, and more modern
topics, are covered. For example, the handbook includes concise coverage of riveted gird-
ers, columns, and connections. While today's civil engineer may say that riveted con-
struction is a method long past its prime, there are millions of existing structures world-
wide that were built using rivets. So when a civil engineer is called on to expand,
rehabilitate, or tear down such a structure, he or she must be able to analyze the riveted
portions of the structure. This handbook provides that capability in a convenient and con-
cise form.
In the realm of modern design techniques, the load and resistance factor method
(LRFD) is covered with more than ten calculation procedures showing its use in various
design situations. The LRFD method is ultimately expected to replace the well-known
and widely used allowable stress design (ASD) method for structural steel building
frameworks. In today's design world many civil engineers are learning the advantages of
the LRFD method and growing to prefer it over the ASD method.
Also included in this handbook is a comprehensive section titled "How to Use This
Handbook." It details the variety of ways a civil engineer can use this handbook in his or
her daily engineering work. Included as part of this section are steps showing the civil en-
gineer how to construct a private list of SI conversion factors for the specific work the en-
gineer specializes in.
The step-by-step practical and applied calculation procedures in this handbook are
arranged so they can be followed by anyone with an engineering or scientific background.
Each worked-out procedure presents fully explained and illustrated steps for solving sim-
ilar problems in civil-engineering design, research, field, academic, or license-examina-
tion situations. For any applied problem, all the civil engineer need do is place his or her
calculation sheets alongside this handbook and follow the step-by-step procedure line for
line to obtain the desired solution for the actual real-life problem. By following the calcu-
lation procedures in this handbook, the civil engineer, scientist, or technician will obtain
accurate results in minimum time with least effort. And the approaches and solutions pre-
sented are modern throughout.
The editor hopes this handbook is helpful to civil engineers worldwide. If the hand-
book user finds procedures which belong in the book but have been left out, he urges the
engineer to send the title of the procedure to him, in care of the publisher. If the procedure
is useful, the editor will ask for the entire text. And if the text is publishable, the editor
will include the calculation procedure in the next edition of the handbook. Full credit will

be given to the person sending the procedure to the editor. And if users find any errors in
the handbook, the editor will be grateful for having these called to his attention. Such er-
rors will be corrected in the next printing of the handbook. In closing, the editor hopes
that civil engineers worldwide find this handbook helpful in their daily work.

HOWTO USETHIS

HANDBOOK

There are two ways to enter this handbook to obtain the maximum benefit from the time
invested. The first entry is through the index; the second is through the table of contents
of the section covering the discipline, or related discipline, concerned. Each method is
discussed in detail below.
Index. Great care and considerable time were expended on preparation of the index
of this handbook so that it would be of maximum use to every reader. As a general guide,
enter the index using the generic term for the type of calculation procedure being consid-
ered. Thus, for the design of a beam, enter at beam(s). From here, progress to the specific
type of beam being considered—such as continuous, of steel. Once the page number or
numbers of the appropriate calculation procedure are determined, turn to them to find the
step-by-step instructions and worked-out example that can be followed to solve the prob-
lem quickly and accurately.
Contents. The contents of each section lists the titles of the calculation procedures
contained in that section. Where extensive use of any section is contemplated, the editor
suggests that the reader might benefit from an occasional glance at the table of contents of
that section. Such a glance will give the user of this handbook an understanding of the
breadth and coverage of a given section, or a series of sections. Then, when he or she
turns to this handbook for assistance, the reader will be able more rapidly to find the cal-
culation procedure he or she seeks.
Calculation Procedures. Each calculation procedure is a unit in itself. However, any
given calculation procedure will contain subprocedures that might be useful to the reader.
Thus, a calculation procedure on pump selection will contain subprocedures on pipe fric-
tion loss, pump static and dynamic heads, etc. Should the reader of this handbook wish to
make a computation using any of such subprocedures, he or she will find the worked-out
steps that are presented both useful and precise. Hence, the handbook contains numerous
valuable procedures that are useful in solving a variety of applied civil engineering prob-
lems.
One other important point that should be noted about the calculation procedures pre-
sented in this handbook is that many of the calculation procedures are equally applicable
in a variety of disciplines. Thus, a beam-selection procedure can be used for civil-, chem-
ical-, mechanical-, electrical-, and nuclear-engineering activities, as well as some others.
Hence, the reader might consider a temporary neutrality for his or her particular specialty
when using the handbook because the calculation procedures are designed for universal
use.
Any of the calculation procedures presented can be programmed on a computer. Such
programming permits rapid solution of a variety of design problems. With the growing
use of low-cost time sharing, more engineering design problems are being solved using a
remote terminal in the engineering office. The editor hopes that engineers throughout the
world will make greater use of work stations and portable computers in solving applied
engineering problems. This modern equipment promises greater speed and accuracy for
nearly all the complex design problems that must be solved in today's world of engineer-
ing.

To make the calculation procedures more amenable to computer solution (while main-
taining ease of solution with a handheld calculator), a number of the algorithms in the
handbook have been revised to permit faster programming in a computer environment.
This enhances ease of solution for any method used—work station, portable computer, or
calculator.
SI Usage. The technical and scientific community throughout the world accepts the SI
(System International) for use in both applied and theoretical calculations. With such
widespread acceptance of SI, every engineer must become proficient in the use of this
system of units if he or she is to remain up-to-date. For this reason, every calculation pro-
cedure in this handbook is given in both the United States Customary System (USCS) and
SI. This will help all engineers become proficient in using both systems of units. In this
handbook the USCS unit is generally given first, followed by the SI value in parentheses
or brackets. Thus, if the USCS unit is 10 ft, it will be expressed as 10 ft (3 m).
Engineers accustomed to working in USCS are often timid about using SI. There real-
ly aren't any sound reasons for these fears. SI is a logical, easily understood, and readily
manipulated group of units. Most engineers grow to prefer SI, once they become familiar
with it and overcome their fears. This handbook should do much to "convert" USCS-user
engineers to SI because it presents all calculation procedures in both the known and un-
known units.
Overseas engineers who must work in USCS because they have a job requiring its us-
age will find the dual-unit presentation of calculation procedures most helpful. Knowing
SI, they can easily convert to USCS because all procedures, tables, and illustrations are
presented in dual units.
Learning SI. An efficient way for the USCS-conversant engineer to learn SI follows
these steps:

1. List the units of measurement commonly used in your daily work.
2. Insert, opposite each USCS unit, the usual SI unit used; Table 1 shows a variety of
commonly used quantities and the corresponding SI units.
3. Find, from a table of conversion factors, such as Table 2, the value to use to convert
the USCS unit to SI, and insert it in your list. (Most engineers prefer a conversion fac-
tor that can be used as a multiplier of the USCS unit to give the SI unit.)
4. Apply the conversion factors whenever you have an opportunity. Think in terms of SI
when you encounter a USCS unit.
5. Recognize—here and now—that the most difficult aspect of SI is becoming comfort-
able with the names and magnitude of the units. Numerical conversion is simple, once
you've set up your own conversion table. So think pascal whenever you encounter
pounds per square inch pressure, newton whenever you deal with a force in pounds,
etc.

SI Table for a Civil Engineer. Let's say you're a civil engineer and you wish to con-
struct a conversion table and SI literacy document for yourself. List the units you com-
monly meet in your daily work; Table 1 is the list compiled by one civil engineer. Next,
list the SI unit equivalent for the USCS unit. Obtain the equivalent from Table 2. Then,
using Table 2 again, insert the conversion multiplier in Table 1.
Keep Table 1 handy at your desk and add new units to it as you encounter them in
your work. Over a period of time you will build a personal conversion table that will be
valuable to you whenever you must use SI units. Further, since you compiled the table, it
will have a familiar and nonfrightening look, which will give you greater confidence in
using SI.

Note: The E indicates an exponent, as in scientific notation, followed by a positive or negative
number, representing the power of 10 by which the given conversion factor is to be multiplied be-
fore use. Thus, for the square feet conversion factor, 9.290304 x 1/100 = 0.09290304, the factor to
be used to convert square feet to square meters. For a positive exponent, as in converting acres to
square meters, multiply by 4.046873 x 1000 = 4046.8.
Where a conversion factor cannot be found, simply use the dimensional substitution. Thus, to
convert pounds per cubic inch to kilograms per cubic meter, find 1 Ib = 0.4535924 kg, and 1 in3 =
0.00001638706 m3. Then, 1 lb/in3 = 0.4535924 kg/0.00001638706 m3 27,680.01, or 2.768
E+ 4.
*This table contains only selected values. See the U.S. Department of the Interior Metric Manu-
al, or National Bureau of Standards, The International System of Units (SI), both available from the
U.S. Government Printing Office (GPO), for far more comprehensive listings of conversion factors.

Units Used. In preparing the calculation procedures in this handbook, the editors and
contributors used standard SI units throughout. In a few cases, however, certain units are
still in a state of development. For example, the unit tonne is used in certain industries,
such as waste treatment. This unit is therefore used in the waste treatment section of this
handbook because it represents current practice. However, only a few SI units are still un-
der development. Hence, users of this handbook face little difficulty from this situation.
Computer-aided Calculations. Widespread availability of programmable pocket
calculators and low-cost laptop computers allow engineers and designers to save thou-
sands of hours of calculation time. Yet each calculation procedure must be programmed,
unless the engineer is willing to use off-the-shelf software. The editor-observing thou-
sands of engineers over the years-detects reluctance among technical personnel to use
untested and unproven software programs in their daily calculations. Hence, the tested
and proven procedures in this handbook form excellent programming input for program-
mable pocket calculators, laptop computers, minicomputers, and mainframes.
A variety of software application programs can be used to put the procedures in this
handbook on computer. Typical of these are MathSoft, Algor, and similar programs.
There are a number of advantages for the engineer who programs his or her own cal-
culation procedures, namely: (1) The engineer knows, understands, and approves every
step in the procedure; (2) there are no questionable, unknown, or legally worrisome steps
in the procedure; (3) the engineer has complete faith in the result because he or she knows
every component of it; and (4) if a variation of the procedure is desired, it is relatively
easy for the engineer to make the needed changes in the program, using this handbook as
the source of the steps and equations to apply.
Modern computer equipment provides greater speed and accuracy for almost all com-
plex design calculations. The editor hopes that engineers throughout the world will make
greater use of available computing equipment in solving applied engineering problems.
Becoming computer literate is a necessity for every engineer, no matter which field he or
she chooses as a specialty. The procedures in this handbook simplify every engineer's
task of becoming computer literate because the steps given comprise—to a great extent—
the steps in the computer program that can be written.
